						<p>"Hmph, the boy is so arrogant!"</p><p>Wei Baoguo's face darkened, but he did not want to make a scene in front of the others and merely gave a cold snort.</p><p>Li Ping was taken aback by Bai Song's sudden intervention; he could not stop him in time, and even if he could, Bai Song would not listen to him.</p><p>"Tianlei, you......"</p><p>Li Ping wanted to say something, but the words stuck in his throat. What could he say? Tell Zhu Tianlei not to take it to heart?</p><p>Such clichés were beyond Li Ping's ability to utter.</p><p>"Since everyone here is an elite, I'll take my leave!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was decisive and got up to leave.</p><p>Bai Song paled; regardless of whether Zhu Tianlei could treat the patient, if he drove him away, he would definitely face consequences.</p><p>"Li Ping, you invited this person over......"</p><p>"It was you who chased him away."</p><p>Li Ping knew what schemes Bai Song was concocting. In any case, he had already brought the person here, so even if they pursued responsibility, it wouldn't be his fault. Therefore, he did not hesitate to retort at Bai Song.</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Tianlei had reached the door of the conference room.</p><p>"Tianlei, wait!"</p><p>Li Ping had just been angry with Bai Song when he suddenly noticed Director Wei Baoguo looking at him. He could climb to the position of head of the emergency department not only because of his professional skills but also because of his ability to read people.</p><p>Wei Baoguo's gaze was clear to him, so despite his reluctance, he stood up. Bai Song let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>"Tianlei, I know what I'm saying sounds shameless, but please don't quarrel with them for my sake......."</p><p>After finishing his statement, Li Ping couldn't help but carefully observe Zhu Tianlei's expression, inwardly cursing Bai Song in the most scathing terms.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at a small patch of yellow mud on the tip of his shoe, bent down, and found that the mud had started to harden. It took him considerable effort to scrape it off with his fingers.</p><p>Everyone in the room held their breath, watching as Zhu Tianlei slowly bent over, extended his fingers, and carefully cleaned the mud from the tip of his shoe, each movement so precise that even the sound of dust flying up could be heard.</p><p>Wei Baoguo's expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>However, looking at the woman beside him with a stern face, showing no hint of emotion, Wei Baoguo could only grit his teeth and endure.</p><p>Finally......</p><p>"I will definitely give you, Director Li, the consideration you deserve."</p><p>Li Ping felt his heart drop back into place. Heaven knew how much sweat had soaked through his back just now.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sat back in his original position.</p><p>"Isn't this a consultation session? Let's begin!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shrugged his shoulders and said loudly with a half-smile that didn't quite reach his eyes.</p><p>Wei Baoguo's face turned green with anger.</p><p>"President Wei, let's begin!"</p><p>Just as Wei Baoguo was about to erupt, the woman sitting quietly beside him suddenly spoke up.</p><p>"Yes, Director Yang, please go over the situation again!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the middle-aged woman.</p><p>This woman has quite a background; it’s obvious that Wei Baoguo is very wary of her.</p><p>"The patient we are consulting today is male, 45 years old. He was admitted to the hospital at 10:30 AM yesterday morning. The initial test results indicated that the patient's gastrointestinal issues were neither caused by viral nor bacterial infections. The color of both his vomit and excreta was dark purple, but no toxins were detected..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei mentally reviewed all the diseases he knew but could not find any that matched this man’s symptoms.</p><p>Yang Kai Ming stood beneath the projection screen, delivering a lengthy speech...</p><p>"Director Yang, as they say, seeing is believing. I think it might be more useful to directly examine the patient."</p><p>As Yang Kai Ming was about to provide a detailed explanation of the test results from various departments, he was interrupted by Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Everyone in the conference room turned their attention back to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Who on earth is this rural young man? His audacity is astounding. Clearly, the president is extremely dissatisfied with him, yet he still behaves so arrogantly.</p><p>"You don't know, but this young man was personally awarded as a Cloud Sea City Outstanding Youth by Mayor Yang previously..."</p><p>A woman who looked to be in her late forties, with a plump face, whispered to another short-haired female doctor beside her.</p><p>"What? No wonder I thought he looked somewhat familiar..."</p><p>Hearing the woman's words, the short-haired female doctor opened her mouth in shock.</p><p>.......</p><p>Listening to the murmurs below, Wei Baoguo's temples throbbed violently.</p><p>"Can you cure my lover?"</p><p>The middle-aged woman, whose demeanor was completely different from that of the other doctors present, had a stern expression but an obviously urgent tone in her voice.</p><p>"Sis, I need to see the patient before I can answer your question, right?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei knew this woman's background was far from simple. Although he found her question somewhat brainless, he still responded politely. Of course, the most important reason was that he could empathize with her feelings.</p><p>"Director Wei, arrange for him to go to the ward!"</p><p>Wei Baoguo was taken aback. Arrange to go to the ward?</p><p>The consultation meeting hadn't concluded yet, and besides, the patient was currently staying in the city hospital's best sterile ward, where all equipment had been imported from Germany and Switzerland. Not only were these instruments expensive, but the sterile environment required strict conditions. Therefore, anyone entering the ward needed to wear a sterile gown and undergo professional disinfection.</p><p>"Director Mao, shouldn't we first finish the consultation meeting before...?"</p><p>"Director Wei, didn't Old Qiao get admitted to your hospital yesterday? Apart from administering saline solution for checks, what else have you done? If the consultation were effective, it wouldn't have come to this. Go to the ward!"</p><p>Mao Fang stood up and made a decision directly.</p><p>Wei Baoguo clenched his fists at his sides.</p><p>"Alright, go to the ward."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei got up, casually stretching his neck. The angle of the projection screen was not good, so he didn't watch for long before feeling his neck ache.</p><p>Bai Song's face darkened.</p><p>Why, when they were both from the countryside, Zhu Tianlei could be so arrogant, while he, despite becoming the head of a department, was in the most unprofitable and least powerful pharmacy section. If it weren't for his wife Chen Xiangru's influence, he probably wouldn't even have the qualifications to sit here.</p>

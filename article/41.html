						<p>Zhang Yuntao didn't feel she had done anything remarkable, and she wasn't even particularly concerned about whether the patients would recover. However, seeing Zhu Tianlei so happy made her happy as well.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei walked into the herb patch with excitement, bending down to touch this one and look at that one, each action careful as if he was handling not herbs but rare treasures.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pulled up a light purple flower herb from the ground and carefully explained it to Zhang Yuntao. Unconsciously, he had already seen her as his woman.</p><p>"Mm, I remember!"</p><p>Facing Zhu Tianlei's trust, Zhang Yuntao nodded seriously.</p><p>Then the two of them split up to work.</p><p>About half an hour later, they met under a big rock. Zhang Yuntao held a large bundle of Hu Xinzi in her arms, light purple flowers swaying gently in the wind, their fragrance filling the air around her. Surrounded by the flowers, she was even more beautiful, and Zhu Tianlei found himself increasingly moved.</p><p>However, saving people was urgent; love could wait!</p><p>After gathering the herbs, they didn't dally any longer but walked quickly down the mountain. When they reached the village entrance, Zhang Yuntao suddenly stopped walking.</p><p>"Yuntao?"</p><p>"Tianlei, you go into the village first. I'll come back later!"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao's expression was slightly awkward. Zhu Tianlei frowned and grabbed her hand without hesitation.</p><p>"What are you afraid of? As an unmarried man and a woman who is widowed, do you fear people gossiping? Come on!"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao felt touched by his concern, but the more he insisted, the more she couldn't bear to involve him. Her reputation in the village was terrible, especially after that incident; she had almost become like a pariah. But Zhu Tianlei was different—he was not only handsome but also renowned as a miracle doctor in the countryside. She couldn't let herself tarnish his reputation.</p><p>"Tianlei, I know you're trying to protect me, but I really don't want people to see us together. Please consider this my plea—you go back first!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei still had to persist, but seeing Zhang Yuntao's eyes shrouded in mist and her face filled with a pained expression, his heart softened, and he could only release Zhang Yuntao's hand.</p><p>"That I'll be going back now. If you need anything, come find me at the clinic!"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao nodded, reluctantly watching Zhu Tianlei's figure disappear from the village entrance. Her heart was bittersweet with sweetness, lingering for a while before slowly lifting her legs and walking into the village.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei carried the collected herbs directly back to the clinic. Ma Lanlan was just about to lock the door when she saw Zhu Tianlei return, immediately breaking into a smile.</p><p>"Tianlei, you're back?"</p><p>"Yes, today's harvest is great! The villagers have hope for treatment!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't wait to share this good news with Ma Lanlan. He knew that in these past two days, Ma Lanlan had been in a bad mood, especially after the incident involving Qu Chuan; she had almost lost weight.</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"I wouldn't lie to anyone, least of all my own woman!"</p><p>"Pah, you're babbling again!"</p><p>Although Ma Lanlan spat at him verbally, her expression remained unchanged. Having spent two days living side by side with Zhu Tianlei, she already understood what kind of person he was, so she had no intention of being angry.</p><p>"Are these herbs from Dahuangshan?"</p><p>Though Ma Lanlan didn't recognize the tiger-striped snake in Zhu Tianlei's arms, as a graduate of the nursing school and having worked as a doctor for three years, she could instantly identify them as herbs.</p><p>"Yes, Lanlan, go get the mortar and pestle. Let's process the medicine tonight and send it to the patients first thing tomorrow."</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Without hesitation, Ma Lanlan immediately went to a small storage room at the back of the clinic to fetch the mortar and pestle that Zhu Tianlei had mentioned.</p><p>These two items were still left over from the old doctor before the clinic closed. Ma Lanlan had never used them before, and now that she took them out, a layer of dust several millimeters thick covered their surfaces.</p><p>"Tianlei, with so many medicines, it's going to be pretty tough to finish everything in one night!"</p><p>The two people worked for more than half an hour, barely managing to grind out a small bowl of powder, which was less than one twentieth of Hu Xinzi.</p><p>"Yes, Lanlan, how about this? You find some people to help us; after all, it's a matter of life and death!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan agreed wholeheartedly with Zhu Tianlei's suggestion. She washed her hands and walked out into the dimming evening light.</p><p>The first to arrive was none other than Hu Dainiu and his mother.</p><p>"Tianlei, your old lady is here to lend you a hand; don't think I'm too slow!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled, saying that he couldn't possibly refuse, but secretly blamed Ma Lanlan for not finding someone younger. The old woman was already in her late sixties, and he didn't want anything to happen to her.</p><p>"Tianlei, I met Lanzi cooling off at the entrance with my mom. She insisted on coming along despite me trying to convince her otherwise!"</p><p>Hu Dainiu looked helpless.</p><p>"It's fine; your mother means well. We can't discourage her enthusiasm."</p><p>The old lady quickly got into the rhythm of things after Zhu Tianlei's brief instructions, moving just as deftly as Ma Lanlan, which surprised both Zhu Tianlei and Hu Dainiu.</p><p>Soon after, a few more people arrived. Yang Xiaoxue walked in through the door, wearing a light yellow floral dress and smiling at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>They exchanged smiles silently, understanding each other without words.</p><p>With more hands on deck, they managed to grind all of Hu Xinzi into powder before ten o'clock.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei and Ma Lanlan smiled as they sent their helpful neighbors out one by one.</p><p>"Lana, I'll take Xiao Xue back first. Wait for me at the clinic and remember to lock the door!"</p><p>When it was left with only Yang Xiaoxue and Ma Lana in the house, Zhu Tianlei finally turned to Ma Lana and said.</p><p>Ma Lana nodded her head. It made sense that Zhu Tianlei, as a man, offered to take Yang Xiaoxue home. After all, it was already midnight.</p><p>But for some reason, seeing their backs walking side by side, Ma Lana's heart felt extremely bitter as if someone had taken away her treasure.</p><p>"Tianlei, I've heard what happened these past few days, but there's nothing I can do to help you... You... you've lost weight!"</p><p>After the two walked out of the clinic for around a hundred meters or so, Yang Xiaoxue finally raised her head and looked at Zhu Tianlei, speaking in a low voice as she could barely hide her concern.</p><p>"Hehe, who said you couldn't help me? You have no idea how happy I was when I saw you come in through the door just now. Having you by my side is more important than any help you could offer!"</p><p>Though Yang Xiaoxue knew Zhu Tianlei's words were to comfort himself, her heart still felt sweet.</p><p>"Oh right, Tianlei, are those medicinal powders we ground earlier really going to cure those people's illnesses?"</p>

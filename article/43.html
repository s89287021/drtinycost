						<p>Zhu Tianlei's expression was dark.</p><p>"I don't know either."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pondered for a moment before ultimately suppressing his doubts in his heart.</p><p>"Uncle, this is the medicine I prepared. Take it once in the afternoon and once in the evening. Don't drink the water from the barrel for now; if necessary, go to the small store at the village office and buy some bottled mineral water."</p><p>After returning home, Zhu Tianlei gave Rong Yishan a few instructions and then left amidst Rong Yishan's profuse thanks. Just before leaving, he scooped a bucket of water from the barrel, put it in a plastic bottle, and carried it with him.</p><p>Throughout the morning, Zhu Tianlei and Ma Lanlan visited patients without stopping. By lunchtime, they had finally finished visiting all the sick villagers in the village, and to their relief, all the villagers who had taken Zhu Tianlei's pills had regained consciousness.</p><p>Without exception, Zhu Tianlei filled a bottle of water from each villager's barrel before leaving.</p><p>At noon, the two of them ate instant noodles at the clinic and set out again without taking a break.</p><p>......</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei and Ma Lanlan enter from outside the courtyard, Li Daici was taken aback. Her face turned slightly awkward, but she quickly came out to greet them.</p><p>"Tianlei, Lanzi, I, Li Daici, am not a human being. I acted rashly before, but you two forgave me and still came to bring medicine for my husband. I...I..."</p><p>"Mrs. Li, stop saying that. I know you were also worried. It's okay, don't blame yourself anymore. Neither Lanzi nor I are petty people."</p><p>Although Ma Lanlan felt resentment and grievance towards Li Daici's previous behavior, she could understand Li Daici's panic and loss of control at the time.</p><p>Hearing Ma Lanlan's words, Li Daici felt even more ashamed. The fiery-tempered woman was so moved that she couldn't say a word.</p><p>"Sister-in-law, Brother has woken up!"</p><p>The awkwardness in the room was broken by Qu Chuan's awakening. Everyone looked at Qu Chuan lying on the kang.</p><p>"Dad, you're awake?"</p><p>"This is......"</p><p>Qu Chuan glanced at his wife and let his gaze linger on Zhu Tianlei and Ma Lanlan, finding them unfamiliar.</p><p>"Dad, they are doctors from Hama Gou Village, his name is Zhu Tianlei, and hers is Ma Lanlan. If not for them, we would probably have met in the underworld!"</p><p>Upon hearing his wife's words, Qu Chuan struggled to sit up but was stopped by Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Among those who were sick, Qu Chuan had the most severe condition. Just now, Zhu Tianlei had already taken Qu Chuan's pulse; although there was no longer any danger to life, the pulse was chaotic, clearly indicating symptoms of spleen and kidney deficiency with turbid yin rising. If not properly nourished later on, it would be easy to leave behind a disease.</p><p>"Brother Qu, no need for courtesy. If you really want to thank someone, thank your sister-in-law instead. It wasn't until she refused to abandon Brother and insisted on pushing him to Hama Gou to seek our treatment that the outcome was uncertain."</p><p>Li Daicui blushed crimson at Zhu Tianlei's words. Seeing her husband look at her with a warm and grateful gaze, Li Daicui silently vowed in her heart that from now on, Zhu Tianlei would be her Li Daicui's benefactor. As long as Zhu Tianlei needed it, she Li Daicui was willing to risk life and limb without hesitation.</p><p>"Brother, I want to ask what you ate or drank before falling ill?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had already examined Li Daicui's water tank just now; it was clean and clear beyond belief, with no trace of insects at all. Moreover, Li Daicui's family used a well, drinking groundwater, theoretically they shouldn't have gotten sick.</p><p>Yanma Kou is downstream of Xiaohexi.</p><p>So, the problem was still with those insects.</p><p>However, at that time, he had carefully checked both upstream and downstream of Xiaohexi, and except for that cluster of insects in the rock crevice, there were no other traces of insects. Could it be that he hadn't observed carefully enough and missed them?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was lost in thought as Qu Chuan suddenly sighed.</p><p>"Ahh, if only I had heeded the young man's advice and not drunk that water from the ditch."</p><p>Qu Chuan merely sighed, but his words were like a bolt of thunder out of the blue, exploding in Zhu Tianlei's heart.</p><p>"Brother Qu, you said someone advised you not to drink the water from the ditch?"</p><p>"Yes, that young man told me the water in the ditch was unsanitary and could easily be fatal. He urged me not to drink it, but I thought about it and realized we rural folks have all grown up drinking mountain spring water since childhood, so I didn't listen to his advice. Who knew...... Ah!"</p><p>"Brother Qu, do you know that person?"</p><p>Qu Chuan looked at Zhu Tianlei's suddenly solemn expression and was taken aback.</p><p>"No, he doesn't seem to be from our nearby villages. He dressed elegantly and had a delicate appearance."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's heart sank further.</p><p>Was this incident just a coincidence?</p><p>After leaving Li Daicui's house, Zhu Tianlei abandoned his usual playful demeanor, walking with his head down all the way, looking preoccupied. Ma Lanlan was worried but did not disturb him, having gotten to know Zhu Tianlei's temperament and character over their time together.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei rarely kept silent, but when he did, it surely meant something was on his mind.</p><p>"Lanlan, go ahead and reorganize the information about these patients. I need it."</p><p>Upon returning to the clinic, Zhu Tianlei assigned Ma Lanlan a task while he himself stared at one water bottle after another collected from villagers' homes, lost in thought.</p><p>After a while, he took out his phone.</p><p>......</p><p>Before dark, a black sedan pulled up outside the clinic. Curious, Ma Lanlan walked to the door and saw a beautiful woman dressed in a black dress exit the car.</p><p>It was her!</p><p>Similarly being a woman, Ma Lanlan couldn't help but look at the jeans she was wearing and felt a hint of self-consciousness.</p><p>"Excuse me, is Tianlei here?"</p><p>"Ximei, you came so quickly! Come in right away!"</p><p>Hearing Hao Xinmei's voice, Zhu Tianlei walked out from behind a small storage room, his face involuntarily breaking into a smile.</p><p>Seeing how familiar the two of them were, Ma Lanlan couldn't quite describe her feelings.</p><p>If the earlier self-consciousness stemmed from jealousy, then the current feeling was an indescribable bitterness.</p><p>"You called me; how could I dare to delay!"</p><p>"Haha, that sounds great! Lanlan, this is Hao Xinmei. Oh right, you should have met her!"</p>

						<p>Apostle Jianxiong's happiness made Zhu Tianlei somewhat stunned. He felt as if Apostle Jianxiong had been intentionally waiting for him.</p><p>"Is the village chief at home?"</p><p>"Yes, Brother Lei, come in quickly!"</p><p>Apostle Jianxiong stepped aside to welcome Zhu Tianlei into the courtyard.</p><p>"To be frank, my father fell ill yesterday and had a high fever at night, mumbling all night long. He is still dazed now!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned. Just two days ago, Apostle Gang was full of energy; what happened?</p><p>When Apostle Jianxiong led Zhu Tianlei into the room, he saw Apostle Gang lying on the bed with his eyes closed.</p><p>In just two days, Apostle Gang seemed like a different person. The flesh on his cheeks had almost sunken in, and there were dark circles under his eyes.</p><p>"Lei, quickly check on your Uncle Yao!"</p><p>Apostle Gang's wife, Liu Chunmei, came out of the inner room and spoke as soon as she saw Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was puzzled and hurried to the bed, touching Apostle Gang's forehead. It was frighteningly hot. He quickly felt his pulse, but his expression became increasingly grim.</p><p>"Lei, what is wrong with your uncle?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression made Liu Chunmei and Apostle Jianxiong feel a sinking sensation in their hearts.</p><p>"Auntie, please think carefully. Did the village chief show any unusual behavior before he fell ill?"</p><p>Liu Chunmei looked at her husband's gaunt face and felt her mind in turmoil. She truly couldn't recall anything unusual about him.</p><p>"Mom, didn't you say that my father had a nightmare and cried out all night two days ago?"</p><p>Yao Jianxiong reminded him.</p><p>"Oh oh oh, yeah, that's right. The night before last, Uncle didn't know what dream he had and was screaming for half the night. No matter how they tried to wake him up, he wouldn't budge. Yesterday morning, when he got up, he hadn't even finished his meal and said he was dazed. Then he... "</p><p>Liu Chunmei spoke while tears streamed down her face.</p><p>"Auntie, listen to me. Don't panic. This is not an illness; someone has cast something on him."</p><p>Liu Chunmei was stunned, forgetting to cry as she stared intently at Zhu Tianlei, waiting for more news.</p><p>"I haven't encountered this before and can't be 100% certain, so I'm saying you and Jianxiong shouldn't panic. I'll give the village chief a few needle pricks; there won't be any immediate issues. Once I confirm the situation, we'll take further action."</p><p>After finishing, Zhu Tianlei began to administer acupuncture on Yao Gang. However, no one knew that this time, Zhu Tianlei used an acupuncture technique he had never tried before. Liu Chunmei and Yao Jianxiong were unaware that every point where Zhu Tianlei's silver needles landed was a human acupoint.</p><p>"Auntie, over the next few days, regardless of who visits, don't let the village chief see anyone or get any wind of it. Just feed him some water a few times a day. In at most two days, I'll come up with a solution."</p><p>After leaving Yao Gang's house, Zhu Tianlei could no longer keep his expression composed.</p><p>Spiritual medicine and alchemy primarily focus on ancient martial arts and medical skills but also incorporate some mystic techniques and witchcraft. After all, Chinese medicine is vast and profound; it's not limited to just medicine and pharmacology. A true master of medicine must possess multiple talents.</p><p>Yao Gang's illness was due to witchcraft.</p><p>However, witchcraft originates from the northern border or Xiangxi, thousands of miles away from Hamaogou. How could Yao Gang have been poisoned by a curse, and who cast it?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei walked slowly, his mind racing with various possibilities. However, even when he reached the clinic's door, he hadn't come to any conclusions.</p><p>The clinic door was locked, indicating that Ma Lanlan had either gone home from work or was on a house call. Zhu Tianlei felt frustrated. Although he originally wanted to comfort Ma Lanlan, since she wasn't there, he didn't enter the clinic but instead circled around the sorghum field and headed straight for Gourd Cave.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei noticed that Gourd Cave seemed to possess a mysterious force. Regardless of the situation he encountered—whether it was mental confusion or physical exhaustion—he could find solace and restoration in Gourd Cave.</p><p>No one knew when Gourd Cave formed or how long it had stood atop the mountain peak, but for Zhu Tianlei, Gourd Cave had become an indispensable part of his life.</p><p>Due to the approaching dusk, the light inside the gourd cave seemed even dimmer than usual. Zhu Tianlei walked directly towards the large boulder where he had practiced before and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>As he breathed in and out, he didn't notice that a layer of white aura slowly rose from his body, gradually becoming more dense, like a mass of entangled clouds engulfing Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>In his mind, the Spirit Doctor Art once again opened up. This time, golden radiance surged, and some previously unfamiliar elements leaped out from the Spirit Doctor Art, akin to water droplets sinking into Zhu Tianlei's sea of consciousness.</p><p>Another new force also shot into Zhu Tianlei's dantian. This force was warm and powerful, enveloping the qi ball within the dantian and prompting it to continuously expand and become fuller.</p><p>"Hu!"</p><p>After two hours, Zhu Tianlei opened his eyes and took a deep breath.</p><p>Looking down, he noticed what seemed to be a faint mark on his palm, though the mark wasn't very clear. It didn't hurt or itch, so Zhu Tianlei paid little attention to it.</p><p>He stood up and found that his vision had indeed improved significantly; from his spot, he could see not just the cave entrance dozens of meters away but even further out through the entrance, up to two or three hundred meters away.</p><p>"Wow! This is going to turn me into a thousand-mile eye!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was excited. The feeling of controlling everything and looking down on the world momentarily overwhelmed him, causing him to jump like a child right there.</p><p>When he finally regained his composure and prepared to leave, he suddenly had a strange feeling.</p><p>Someone had been in the gourd cave!</p><p>Although the gourd cave wasn't a forbidden area or Zhu Tianlei's private domain, the sense of someone having been there was not just a brief visit; it seemed they had stayed for quite some time.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei walked around the cave and found traces of something having been moved. A cave, with nothing but rocks, who would move things here?</p><p>However, aside from these signs of movement, Zhu Tianlei found nothing else and could only leave the gourd cave filled with questions.</p><p>The sun set in the west, and a new moon hung on the treetops.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei slowly descended the mountain, using his hand to brush aside the reeds on both sides while still thinking about the poison in Yao Gang's body.</p><p>He was comforting Liu Chunmei and Yao Jianxiong's mother. Although he could identify what kind of poison Yao Gang had, he knew how to detoxify it, but detoxification also meant risking his life.</p><p>To be cautious, he needed to find the person who inflicted the curse; their blood would be the most effective method for detoxification.</p><p>However, who was responsible?</p><p>Half an hour later, Zhu Tianlei reached Dahuangshan Mountain but did not go home. Instead, he went back to Yao Gang's house.</p><p>As soon as he arrived at the door, he saw someone coming out from the gate. Zhu Tianlei stumbled and darted into a nearby alley. Only after that person had walked a distance away did Zhu Tianlei emerge.</p>

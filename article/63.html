						<p>Zhu Tianlei carefully placed the necklace around Hao Xinmei's neck, along with his sincere feelings and love. </p><p>The two emerged from the mall, and Zhu Tianlei insisted on riding his motorcycle back home, to which Hao Xinmei did not object.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hung all the things he bought on both sides of the motorcycle. Hao Xinmei stood in place until Zhu Tianlei's figure completely disappeared before she got back into her car.</p><p>Neither of them noticed that this encounter had significantly altered their inner states; the veil over their genuine feelings gradually melted away.</p><p>"Uncle Hu, I'm sorry, but I rode the motorcycle for two days. This is a token of my gratitude!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei lifted two boxes of crystal cakes from the motorcycle and handed them to Hu Dainiu.</p><p>"Oh dear, Tianlei, how come you're still so formal with me? You saved my life, and I haven't thanked you yet. Look at you, quickly put those things away!"</p><p>"Uncle, please keep them!"</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei placed the items on a stone grinder in the middle of the yard and swiftly left the courtyard, chasing after Hu Dainiu. By the time Zhu Tianlei was gone, he had already walked over two or three hundred meters.</p><p>This small incident further improved Hu Dainiu's impression of Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Dad, Mom, I'm back!"</p><p>The moment he stepped into the yard, Zhu Tianlei shouted loudly.</p><p>"Tianlei, come quick, who's here?"</p><p>A moment later, Hou Suqin ran out from the house with a beaming face.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback. His mother had always been a honest and simple-minded rural woman who spoke softly most of the time. Who could possibly make his mother so excited?</p><p>Tianlei, your cousin has come!" Just as he crossed the threshold, Hou Suqin couldn't help but whisper to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Cousin?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned. From childhood to adulthood, this was his first time hearing that he had a cousin, and not only that, the cousin wasn't even related by blood. Was Mom so excited about it?</p><p>But before Zhu Tianlei could figure things out, the curtain in the inner room lifted, and a man in his early thirties poked his head out from behind it.</p><p>"Wenbiao, this is your nephew, Zhu Tianlei!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback. Wasn't his cousin too young?</p><p>"Quickly call someone!"</p><p>Seeing her son stand there speechlessly, Hou Suqin was somewhat puzzled and urged him.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the man in front of him, feeling a strange sensation but couldn't pinpoint what exactly was odd about it.</p><p>"Cousin!"</p><p>No matter what he thought, he had to maintain some formality.</p><p>"Tianlei, right? He's grown so much already!"</p><p>This young cousin spoke with a somewhat sly tone that sounded awkward.</p><p>"Oh no, don't stand at the door. Quickly come inside; I'll go make a few dishes. Wenbiao and your brother-in-law can have a drink together this noon."</p><p>"Sis, you don't need to do all that. I still have some business in town, so I won't be staying long!"</p><p>"That won't do, you haven't come home for so many years. You must have some food before you leave!"</p><p>Hou Suqin was very insistent.</p><p>"Sister, I promise to visit more often when I'm free, but today really can't make it!"</p><p>Hou Suqin tried to say more, but Zhu Tianlei stopped her.</p><p>"Mom, since Uncle has something on his plate, don't force him. Important matters come first, right?"</p><p>"That's right, Tianlei's mom, then listen to Wenbiao's."</p><p>Zhu Quezi also came out of the house upon hearing this, and his enthusiasm was much calmer compared to Hou Suqin's.</p><p>Seeing both her husband and son speak up, Hou Suqin could no longer insist.</p><p>After entering the house, Zhu Tianlei's unexpected cousin did not stay for long. He simply had a brief chat with Zhu Tianlei before taking his leave.</p><p>"Mom, why have I never heard you mention that I have a cousin?"</p><p>Only after everyone left did Zhu Tianlei ask.</p><p>"Oh my! I didn't realize this child was still alive; I thought he died of scarlet fever!"</p><p>"Died of scarlet fever?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned. What kind of phrase was this? How could one be unsure if someone lived or died?</p><p>Hou Suqin sighed, her eyes welling up with tears before she spoke. From Hou Suqin's fragmented account, Zhu Tianlei finally understood the bizarre life experiences of his young cousin.</p><p>The story was cliché: Hou Suqin grew up in a poor family where they often had no food from one meal to the next. Fortunately, an aunt in the village treated her kindly, frequently giving her cornmeal cakes and sweet potato biscuits to fill her hunger, which helped her survive those difficult times.</p><p>This auntie gave birth to a son in her old age and suddenly fell pregnant when she was in her forties. It turned out to be a boy, which made the entire family ecstatic. This son was none other than Jin Wenbiao mentioned earlier.</p><p>A few years later, Hou Suqin got married and left her village. The auntie would still bring Jin Wenbiao to visit occasionally. When Jin Wenbiao was eight years old, Hou Suqin gave birth to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Jin Wenbiao loved little Zhu Tianlei very much and often took him out to play. However, later the auntie's husband went out of town for business, so they moved away as a family. Despite this, the two families would still communicate from time to time. But about seventeen or eighteen years ago, their correspondence suddenly ceased.</p><p>Later, Hou Suqin inquired around and learned that Jin Wenbiao had contracted scarlet fever and passed away. Her auntie also died of heartbreak; she was bedridden for several days due to her grief.</p><p>Therefore, seeing Jin Wenbiao suddenly today made her overjoyed beyond words.</p><p>"Mom, how did he find our place?"</p><p>Hou Suqin was taken aback but soon laughed.</p><p>"How did he find us? He inquired, of course. Our family is a permanent resident in Toad Gully; it's not easy to track us down!"</p><p>Hou Suqin had deep and sincere feelings for Jin Wenbiao, but Zhu Tianlei didn't share her sentiment.</p><p>"Why did he come?"</p><p>"To see me, his cousin, of course! I never thought this kid would be so successful, becoming the deputy director of the town's herbal medicine factory at such a young age."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's heart raced. Deputy director of an herbal medicine factory?</p><p>"Tianlei, you keep asking questions as soon as you return. I haven't even asked you yet; what have you been doing in the city these past few days? Didn't you go to see that woman?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had only had Hu Dainiu send a message to Zhu Quezi and Hou Suqin, saying he went to town, without mentioning the reason. However, he never expected Hou Suqin to jump to such conclusions.</p><p>"Mom, where are you thinking again? I went into the city to see patients. Look, here's my payment for consultations; now I'm rushing back to show my respect to you and Dad!"</p><p>Having said that, Zhu Tianlei carried a pile of things he had placed at the door earlier and put them on the bed: deer antler oral liquid, collagen cake, senior citizen milk powder, oatmeal, and other colorful items that made Hou Suqin and Zhu Quezi dizzy.</p><p>"Mom, try it on!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took out the clothes he had bought for Hou Suqin and pushed his mom into the inner room to change. Then, he helped Zhu Quezi change into new clothes as well.</p><p>The moment Hou Suqin stood in front of the mirror wearing her new clothes, tears streamed down her face.</p><p>The clothes she was wearing were from her son, but in the blink of an eye, her son had grown up, from a babbling toddler to an adult who knew how to honor his parents!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei watched his dad and mom laugh like children, feeling warm and fulfilled. The life he wanted was one where his parents were healthy, his family was happy, his wife was by his side, and his children were around him.</p>

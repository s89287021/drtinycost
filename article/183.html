						<p>Tang Wen couldn't help but feel amused upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words. Wasn't Zhu Tianlei supposed to be nervous instead of acting so stupid?</p><p>"Vice President Tang, are you really sure about this?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Tang Wen and suddenly asked seriously.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, are you trying to stall? Leaving aside your attempt to frame me, you must give the family an account for Wu Xiaohui's death. Moreover, you need to provide an explanation to all the public in the quarantine area. This is not up for debate; this is justice!"</p><p>Li Ping and Li Yong, sitting on the bench, were both somewhat surprised. They even doubted that the impassioned man in the defendant's seat was the same Tang Wen who always spoke softly at meetings.</p><p>As for those spectators who did not know the truth, they were stunned by Tang Wen's righteous words, their eyes filled with condemnation as they looked at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"We must give justice to the patient..."</p><p>"Yes, such beasts absolutely cannot be tolerated. Arrest him and put him in prison..."</p><p>No one on the bench knew who shouted first, but soon others began to agree, turning the once solemn courtroom into a chaotic market.</p><p>Hao Xinmei and Mao Yuruo felt as if they were sitting on pins and needles. They never expected Tang Wen to be so despicable and even arrange people on the bench.</p><p>"Order! Order! No shouting in the courtroom!"</p><p>The judge pounded heavily on the table with his gavel and shouted loudly.</p><p>Tang Wen glanced at Zhu Tianlei, their eyes meeting.</p><p>"Vice President Tang, now it's my turn!" </p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled slightly, mouthing the words to Tang Wen.</p><p>This young man, so calm and composed, even smiling as he killed people, made Tang Wen involuntarily think of that figure in the video who rushed down the stairs like lightning at a critical moment, saving Jiang Haitao.</p><p>Loosing the bow has no turning back.</p><p>He wanted to die amidst the bustling noise, and moreover, who would win was still uncertain. Tang Wen had lived forty more years than Zhu Tianlei; his experience alone would be enough for Zhu Tianlei to swallow hard.</p><p>"Plaintiff, if you cannot provide evidence to prove that you did not cause the patient's death, the case will need to be transferred to the judicial department for criminal proceedings."</p><p>As soon as the judge finished speaking, Lei Pan immediately understood.</p><p>So Tang Wen was playing this trick, confusing everyone and buying time. If the case were transferred to the judicial department, even if Zhu Tianlei were proven innocent, the entire trial process would take at least forty working days. By then, it would be too late.</p><p>However, now he had no preparation. He did have a strong will, but that was based on solid evidence and complete forensic evidence. A good lawyer never fabricated cases or made groundless arguments.</p><p>"Mr. Lei, I want to ask, what kind of evidence do I need to prove my innocence? I am ignorant of the law; I have never committed any illegal acts, so I'm not clear about these things!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Lei Pan with a blank expression.</p><p>"Any evidence that can prove your involvement in this matter can be used as evidence."</p><p>Lei Pan looked at Zhu Tianlei. Although he had little contact with Zhu Tianlei, his understanding of him was considerable. He admired this young man, so when Zhu Tianlei asked him this question, he almost immediately determined that Zhu Tianlei could defend himself.</p><p>Although he did not know what Zhu Tianlei could do in this situation.</p><p>"Physical evidence?"</p><p>"Physical evidence is any item or trace that can prove the truth of the case, such as tools used during the crime, bloodstains, fingerprints left at the scene, and so on. Of course, what you need to provide now is exactly the opposite."</p><p>"Oh, I see, it's really quite complicated!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked enlightened, and Tang Wen felt a sense of satisfaction. Zhu Tianlei was indeed a medical prodigy, but his emotional intelligence was clearly lacking; he had no cultural background and did not even know what physical evidence was. Such a person wanted to compete with him! Hmph!</p><p>"Then I wonder if this counts as physical evidence?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took out a folded square piece of paper from his clothes and handed it to Lei Pan casually.</p><p>When Lei Pan opened the paper, he was secretly taken aback.</p><p>"Of course, it counts!"</p><p>He almost wanted to give Zhu Tianlei a thumbs-up in his heart.</p><p>Tang Wen's eyes swept over the paper in Lei Pan's hand. Since he was far away, he couldn't see the contents clearly, but he carefully recalled every detail and didn't believe that Zhu Tianlei could present any evidence.</p><p>With Wu Xiaozhong there and these witnesses, even with wings, Zhu Tianlei would find it hard to fly.</p><p>"And this."</p><p>Before Lei Pan could hand over what he was holding to the judge, Zhu Tianlei took out another piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to Lei Pan.</p><p>When Lei Pan saw this paper, he couldn't control himself and gave Zhu Tianlei a thumbs-up right in front of him.</p><p>High, truly high!</p><p>Compared to this iron-toothed, copper-jawed gold medal lawyer, Zhu Tianlei seemed to have more potential as a lawyer.</p><p>"Your Honor, this is the evidence presented by the plaintiff!"</p><p>Lei Pan withdrew his faint smile and returned to being the stern, iron-blooded lawyer he was, handing over what he was holding directly to the judge.</p><p>At the moment the judge saw what Lei Pan had handed over, his face and those of several jurors twitched slightly.</p><p>This was solid evidence.</p><p>"Mr. Lawyer Lei, is the evidence untrue, or is it that the court will not accept it?"</p><p>Seeing the judge still silent, Zhu Tianlei did not hesitate to speak again. At this point, Tang Wen already knew that things were probably not as optimistic as he had imagined.</p><p>"Of course not......"</p><p>"If so, I have other evidence."</p><p>Before Lei Pan could finish speaking, Zhu Tianlei spoke up again. Lei Pan looked at Zhu Tianlei in disbelief—more evidence?</p><p>"May I request my witness to appear in court?"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Lei Pan did not wait for the judge to speak and answered immediately. In such situations, both parties could apply to submit physical evidence or invite witnesses.</p><p>As Lei Pan finished speaking, a side door next to the courtroom was opened. A handsome young man walked in, followed by a dignified middle-aged man.</p><p>"I am Wang Hao, a patient from the quarantine zone. On the night when Wu Xiaohui and Doctor Zhu had an argument, I was behind Wu Xiaohui. The video should show that I can testify that Doctor Zhu came over to tell Wu Xiaohui to go to bed early and take care of her health."</p><p>The young man was Wang Hao, the second-year college student who Wu Xiaohui had nagged about transferring money via WeChat.</p><p>"You are lying. If Zhu Tianlei went to tell Xiao Hui to go to bed early, why wasn't she wearing clothes? Who goes to talk to a man without clothes on in the middle of the night? I ask you, have you taken something from Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>Upon hearing Wang Hao's words, Wu Xiaozhong could no longer tolerate it.</p><p>Wang Hao looked somewhat embarrassed but, recalling Zhu Tianlei's words, took a deep breath.</p><p>"Wu Xiaohui was not wearing clothes at midnight because she was... in the room with me..."</p><p>As soon as Wang Hao finished speaking, the courtroom erupted again.</p>

						<p>Yang Hua's face darkened like a storm cloud bearing down, and he could no longer hold back. He pushed open the ward door forcefully, with Zhu Tianlei following closely behind.</p><p>"Enough! She's still just a child!"</p><p>Yang Hua roared in anger.</p><p>At first glance, Zhu Tianlei saw the girl lying on the bed, her features delicate and eyes bright but filled with a misty haze. Fear, helplessness, and despair flickered within them. The exposed skin was riddled with sores, from which yellow pus could be seen seeping out.</p><p>Standing beside the bed was a woman in her thirties, dressed in a crimson dress, with slightly tanned skin that clearly had sunscreen on it. Her eyes were small, but they radiated malice.</p><p>"What are you yelling for? I'm educating my child. Is this any of your business?"</p><p>The woman showed no fear when she saw Yang Hua, indicating that such confrontations were not uncommon.</p><p>"Is this what you call educating your child? She's already in this state, and you're still pinching her. How can you do it?"</p><p>"Oh, spare me your pretense, thinking you’re better than everyone else. I sent my daughter to the hospital for a whole week, and just the hospitalization fees amounted to several thousand yuan. You haven't even come up with a reasonable explanation yet, and you still have the nerve to argue with me? Pah! Filthy shameless woman!"</p><p>The woman looked down her nose at him, but these words felt like a needle piercing through Yang Hua's anger instantly. No matter who she was, what she said was a fact that Yang Hua could not refute.</p><p>"Hmph, I'm here to discharge my daughter today. Money doesn't grow on trees; we can't just donate it to your hospital!"</p><p>"She cannot be discharged. The child is unable to move, and any movement poses a life-threatening risk!"</p><p>Hearing the woman's insistence on discharging their daughter, Yang Hua became even more anxious.</p><p>"She's my daughter. I'll do whatever I want with her, and we'll take responsibility if she dies!"</p><p>Throughout this exchange, the girl on the bed remained expressionless, as if she hadn't heard anything about her life being abandoned.</p><p>"You......"</p><p>Yang Hua's face turned pale, and his lips trembled for a long time without uttering a word.</p><p>"You all stop fighting. I know it was my fault. I held Dad back, you, and even Brother. It’s all my mistake. I shouldn’t have been born, much less survived. I’m going to die right now..."</p><p>Suddenly, the girl on the bed shouted and leaped off it, her weak body somehow finding strength in an instant to pounce towards the window.</p><p>The ICU was on the 7th floor; jumping down meant certain death.</p><p>But this scene unfolded too quickly, leaving no time for anyone to react. Yang Hua froze like a statue, while a glint of excitement flickered in the woman’s eyes.</p><p>"Sis, life is yours. Under any circumstances, you must not give up easily!"</p><p>Feng Xiaoyu was shocked as Zhu Tianlei suddenly enveloped her in his arms, looking completely incredulous—hadn’t this person just been standing by the door moments ago?</p><p>Yang Hua was initially stunned, but his heart gradually settled.</p><p>"Where did you come from?"</p><p>The woman hadn't expected a sudden intruder and couldn't openly express herself, clearly seething with anger.</p><p>"Sis, don't be afraid. Never give up hope at any time!"</p><p>Ignoring the woman, Zhu Tianlei carefully lifted Feng Xiaoyu into his arms and gently placed her on the hospital bed.</p><p>Having narrowly escaped death, Feng Xiaoyu was still shaken by the experience.</p><p>Looking at Zhu Tianlei and feeling the warmth emanating from him, a small flutter stirred in Feng Xiaoyu’s young heart.</p><p>"Hey, are you deaf? I’m asking you! Who are you to come into my daughter's ward and lay hands on her!"</p><p>Seeing Feng Xiaoyu saved by Zhu Tianlei and then ignored by him, the woman’s anger boiled over. She charged at Zhu Tianlei’s back as she spoke.</p><p>"You.......What are you doing?"</p><p>The woman's hand did not touch Zhu Tianlei, but instead, he grabbed her wrist. Looking at Zhu Tianlei's youthful and handsome face, which was covered in a layer of frost, she couldn't help shivering.</p><p>"Are you her mother?"</p><p>"You......Of course I am her mother! If I weren't, how could I afford to spend so much money on this half-dead sickly brat's medical bills?"</p><p>After saying that, the woman glared viciously at Feng Xiaoyu.</p><p>"Do you think you deserve it?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression was cold, and no one could tell what he was thinking at that moment. Only the woman facing him could feel the chill emanating from his body.</p><p>"You.....Who do you think you are? Who gives a damn who I am to this little bitch? Do you have the right to give orders?"</p><p>"A beastly person, if humans don't eliminate them, heaven will; if heaven doesn't, I will!"</p><p>As soon as Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, the woman let out an awful scream. Her face turned pale, and she collapsed on the ground.</p><p>Yang Hua and the medical staff in the corridor did not feel any sympathy; in fact, they were secretly clapping for Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Feng Xiaoyu looked at her paralyzed stepmother, unable to describe her own feelings. She didn't feel happy, nor did she feel sympathetic. She was like a puppet, living aimlessly and numbly.</p><p>"Doctor Yang, I can cure this little girl's illness!"</p><p>After dealing with his ruthless and heartless stepmother, Zhu Tianlei turned around to slowly say to Yang Hua.</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>Yang Hua's eyes shone with golden light.</p><p>"Yes, but I need Dr. Yang's cooperation!"</p><p>"You say it; as long as we can cure Xiao Yu's illness, any level of cooperation is acceptable!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had a good impression of Yang Hua and was genuinely sympathetic towards Feng Xiaoyu's suffering, so he was indeed very concerned about her condition.</p><p>"I need to secure Xiao Yu's hands and feet to the bed; the treatment process will be painful, and it cannot be interrupted."</p><p>"Secure?"</p><p>Yang Hua repeated the word, momentarily not understanding its meaning.</p><p>"Yes, as for the tools, Dr. Yang can figure them out!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said this and glanced at Feng Xiaoyu with a hint of reluctance, only to meet with a calm and gentle gaze.</p><p>"Big brother, I'm not afraid of pain; as long as I can live, I won't mind any kind of pain!"</p><p>Feng Xiaoyu was sensitive and astute, instantly understanding Zhu Tianlei's concerns.</p><p>"Alright, Xiao Meng, go to the administrative office to get some large rubber bands and bed clamps."</p><p>A small nurse with a round face left quickly upon hearing this.</p><p>The woman whose blood vessels were blocked by Zhu Tianlei using acupuncture slumped to the ground, unable to speak or move, her eyes filled with resentment glaring at everyone in the room.</p><p>Soon, the small nurse returned holding a bunch of things but looked slightly odd.</p><p>"Director Yang, Tiger Qi has come back!"</p><p>Yang Hua's originally excited and agitated expression darkened slightly upon hearing "Tiger Qi," although it was fleeting.</p><p>Tian Lei, you say it. How should we do it?</p><p>Yang Hua stabilized his thoughts and took the items from the nurse before asking,</p><p>"First, wrap Xiao Yu's wrists and ankles with a towel, then secure the rubber bands, and finally use the blanket clamp connected to a rope to fix the rubber bands under the bed frame."</p>

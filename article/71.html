						<p>Zhu Tianlei called Hao Xinmei, originally wanting to share the good news of registering his company. Little did he know that Hao Xinmei was in a board meeting, and they hung up after exchanging only a few words.</p><p>Feeling somewhat disappointed, Zhu Tianlei realized that he desperately wanted someone close to him to share this joy with.</p><p>When he arrived at the bus station, the big bus had not yet arrived.</p><p>Wu Pingjian acted quickly. On the third day Zhu Tianlei suggested increasing the number of buses, there were four long-distance buses running between Yunhai City and Hamagou, all in excellent condition, with drivers who were young professionals trained in customer service.</p><p>Thus, Zhu Tianlei had a good impression of Wu Pingjian. In his free time, he would secretly speculate about Ma Lao's identity, but with his brain and experience, he could not figure it out.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood under the bus shelter at the station, lost in thought for quite some time. Just as he was thinking of crossing the road to buy a bottle of mineral water, someone suddenly patted him on the shoulder.</p><p>Given Zhu Tianlei's quick reflexes and agility, few people in Yunhai City could match his skills, so as soon as this person touched his shoulder, Zhu Tianlei grabbed their wrist with one hand, performed an over-the-shoulder throw, and sent them crashing to the ground.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Yang Hua was in excruciating pain from the fall. His right arm felt like it was broken, the pain unbearable.</p><p>Looking at Zhu Tianlei's stern face, Yang Hua inwardly cursed. If he had known this kid was so skilled, he would have tried talking before resorting to action.</p><p>"Little brother, your move was pretty dirty!"</p><p>Supporting himself with his left hand and enduring the searing pain, Yang Hua stood up and looked at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sized up Yang Hua. In his forties, Yang had a scholarly appearance, with deep-set eyes and a high nose bridge, and there were faint stubble marks on his chin.</p><p>He was wearing a white shirt, brown knee-length shorts, and black sneakers. From his attire, he did not seem like an evil person.</p><p>"My name is Yang Hua, I'm a doctor at the Dahuaxian Central Hospital."</p><p>Upon hearing Yang Hua's introduction, Zhu Tianlei realized that his earlier actions were impulsive, and a hint of embarrassment crossed his face.</p><p>"Did you need me for something?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was certain that he did not recognize the other person. Given this, it was likely that the person had a matter to discuss.</p><p>"To be frank, I just watched you administer an injection to assist with childbirth in the administrative hall. Postpartum hemorrhage is extremely dangerous, with a mortality rate exceeding 30%, but after your injection, the bleeding stopped immediately, and the delivery proceeded smoothly..."</p><p>Thinking back on what he had seen, Yang Hua still felt his heart racing.</p><p>Having practiced medicine for over ten years, he knew well how terrifying postpartum hemorrhage was. Not to mention in an administrative hall with only a few acupuncture needles; even in a well-equipped hospital with adequate medical staff and blood supplies, it would be impossible to stop the bleeding so quickly, let alone for the mother to be in good spirits after giving birth.</p><p>"So Doctor Yang, you're just curious?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Yang Hua and genuinely did not know what his intentions were.</p><p>"Brother, don't laugh at me, but a week ago, I treated a patient, a young girl around ten years old. She had countless red sores on her skin that would ulcerate whether it was cold or hot. Over the past week, I have conducted numerous tests and consulted various experts, but we have been unable to diagnose the child's condition."</p><p>Just thinking about the twisted expression of pain on the child's face in bed, and the anguished cries during medication administration, Yang Hua felt a lump form in his throat.</p><p>"I came to the city today to find someone and see if we could arrange for an expert team to conduct a consultation at the county hospital."</p><p>Seeing Yang Hua's somber expression, Zhu Tianlei knew that this trip had not gone smoothly.</p><p>Doctors have hearts like parents, and being so diligent and devoted to a patient showed that the man in front of him was a good doctor.</p><p>"Why didn't Doctor Yang bring the patient directly to a city hospital or even a provincial hospital?"</p><p>"I wish I could, but that child cannot move at all. Any movement would cause the sores to rapidly spread and result in massive bleeding. Moreover, the parents refuse to allow the child to be treated elsewhere!"</p><p>This was also Yang Hua's frustration as a doctor. He could only treat patients, but the parents were the guardians, and he had no authority to make decisions for them.</p><p>Seeing Yang Hua's honest expression, Zhu Tianlei felt slightly moved.</p><p>"Doctor Yang hopes I can take a look."</p><p>Yang Hua's expression shifted slightly, not expecting Zhu Tianlei to be so direct. However, it was also good this way, saving him from having to carefully consider how to bring up the topic.</p><p>"Alright, I'll go with Doctor Yang."</p><p>Yang Hua did not expect Zhu Tianlei not only to accept but to do so decisively, leaving him momentarily speechless.</p><p>He knew that Zhu Tianlei's medical skills were far from ordinary. For the first time in a week, Yang Hua felt relieved.</p><p>"Doctor Yang, I'm sorry for earlier. Let me set your arm back in place!"</p><p>After saying this, Zhu Tianlei placed his hand on Yang Hua's shoulder, tightened his grip, raised his wrist, and with a snap, he realigned the dislocated joint.</p><p>Yang Hua had even more confidence in Zhu Tianlei's medical skills.</p><p>Yang Hua led Zhu Tianlei to the parking lot of the bus station, where both got into a minivan one after another.</p><p>In the car, Zhu Tianlei asked again about the young patient's condition, vaguely guessing something but did not say anything in front of Yang Hua.</p><p>Dahe County Hospital was not far from the bus station. With the new road, they were inside the hospital gates within half an hour.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, get out!"</p><p>Yang Hua spoke with great politeness.</p><p>"Just call me Tianlei. I'm just a village doctor from Hamagou, nothing more than that!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei got out of the car and said to Yang Hua.</p><p>"If you're not a doctor, then there aren't many people in this world who deserve the title!"</p><p>Yang Hua's words were sincere, and Zhu Tianlei no longer declined. Following Yang Hua's lead, they entered the intensive care unit, where a strong smell of disinfectant greeted them.</p><p>As they just reached the door, there suddenly came a loud clanging noise from inside the room, followed by curses.</p><p>"You little omen of bad luck, you cheap slut who hooks men, do you even have the face to live? If I were you, I'd jump out that window right now and save others from being implicated..."</p><p>Yang Hua's face flushed with embarrassment, while Zhu Tianlei barely concealed a frown.</p><p>"Auntie, please stop cursing. I don't want treatment, can't I not get treated... sob sob..."</p><p>A faint, suppressed sobbing sound followed.</p><p>"Hmph, you cheap slut. Aren't you the one who tattles? Go tell your dad what I said just now and see if I don't strangle you..."</p><p>"Ah! Auntie, I didn't tattle, ah..."</p>

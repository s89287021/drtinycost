						<p>"Village chief, you are accusing us unfairly today. The troublemakers aren't from our village!"</p><p>Seeing Yao Gang arrive, the fat aunt immediately stepped forward.</p><p>Following the fat aunt's finger, Yao Gang saw Li Dacui clutching her waist, exhibiting a fierce demeanor like a tiger.</p><p>Seeing that Li Dacui was the one causing the disturbance made Yao Gang's heart skip a beat.</p><p>Li Dacui had quite a reputation; in ten villages, there was none other like her. She could strike at will and verbally assault people without hesitation, with three strong men not being her match.</p><p>"Li Dacui, what are you shouting about? Did you break the glass?"</p><p>Yao Gang adjusted his expression. After all, he was the village chief; no matter how this woman acted, he couldn't afford to stay silent.</p><p>"Apo Gang, a murderer has appeared in your village. Are you going to do anything about it?"</p><p>Murderer?</p><p>"What are you talking about? Who committed the murder? Whose life was taken?"</p><p>"I'm lying? The slut from your clinic killed my husband, and that handsome young man wanted to finish me off too. You're the village chief, right? I want to see if you'll do something or not. If you don't understand, I'll go to the city to drum up support and file a complaint to get rid of you as village chief!"</p><p>Yao Gang's face darkened.</p><p>Was Li Dacui referring to Ma Lanlan?</p><p>Ma Lanlan had been serving as the village doctor for more than three years, always being cautious and meticulous, never making any mistakes. How could she possibly have caused someone's death?</p><p>Who was the spineless punk who killed someone? Was he Ma Lanlan's boyfriend?</p><p>"Li Dacui, you dog? My daughter is a proper graduate of a nursing school. Your husband died from a disease he deserved to die from. Don't try to pin it on my daughter; there's no way!"</p><p>Before Yao Gang could react, Ma Lanlan's mother rushed over upon hearing the news, with Ma Lanlan's father following closely behind them, both carrying weapons in their hands, clearly prepared for trouble.</p><p>"Mom? Dad? What are you two doing here?"</p><p>Hearing her parents' voices, Ma Lanlan quickly came out. She knew her mom had a short temper; she was like a firecracker, fearless in a fight, and she fiercely protected her child. Her father, on the other hand, was a henpecked man who acted on his wife's commands without thinking. If they really fought, the consequences would be terrifying!</p><p>"Daughter, don't be afraid; your parents are here. She dares to touch one hair of yours, and we'll kill her!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood behind Ma Lanlan, his mind racing.</p><p>After twenty years in the village, he had never known that Ma Lanlan's parents were so formidable. Such a father-in-law and mother-in-law made him feel overwhelmed!</p><p>"You two old fools, protecting your child to my Li Dacui's detriment! Am I someone who fears trouble? I'll tell you now, as soon as my husband breathes his last, I'll make your daughter pay with her life!"</p><p>Yao Gang looked at the tense group before him and felt a bit flustered. What was going on here?</p><p>At a glance, he saw Zhu Tianlei standing behind Ma Lanlan, and his eyes lit up.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was a miracle doctor, capable of reviving the dead, let alone someone still alive. If they could get the man back on his feet, this matter would be resolved. Just as he was about to speak, he heard Li Dacui's wailing cry.</p><p>"Dad, Dad!"</p><p>The man originally lying on the cart suddenly convulsed. Before Li Dacui could rush over, the man vomited a large pool of blood, which was dark red with hints of white threads visible within.</p><p>"Dad, don't scare me! Why are you coughing up blood?"</p><p>Li Dacui was indeed a strong-willed woman, but she truly cared for her husband. Otherwise, she wouldn't have pushed the cart to the clinic and caused trouble.</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei walk over, Li Dacui instinctively hugged Qu Chuan as if letting go would mean his death.</p><p>"Help me!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said coldly.</p><p>Li Dacui was stunned for a moment before she hugged Qu Chuan even tighter.</p><p>"I don't want you to treat him! You and that little fox spirit are in cahoots. You're both murderers. Don't touch my man, get lost, get lost!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's brow furrowed, he was furious!</p><p>Suddenly, a flash of silver appeared in his hand as he quickly stabbed a silver needle into Li Dacui's neck. She felt her shoulder go numb, her arms losing strength, and then her mouth and tongue also became stiff.</p><p>She raised her hands trying to slap her face, to regain sensation in her mouth and tongue, but her arms were like two noodles with no strength at all.</p><p>"Lanlan, give him a pill!"</p><p>Ignoring Li Dacui, Zhu Tianlei said sternly to Ma Lanlan.</p><p>Ma Lanlan was already experienced; she quickly pried open Qu Chuan's mouth and slipped the purple ginseng medicine pill inside.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei swiftly removed the silver needle, his movements like flowing water, inserting needles at several acupuncture points on Qu Chuan's body, then again transmitting spiritual energy.</p><p>As expected, there was a cold aura within Qu Chuan's body blocking the transmission of spiritual energy, and the counterforce was even greater than the cold aura in Hu zi's body.</p><p>In no time, Zhu Tianlei's face turned pale, his forehead covered in sweat, but Qu Chuan's expression relaxed considerably.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei released Qu Chuan, giving Li Dacui a cold look. Li Dacui shivered when she met Zhu Tianlei's gaze.</p><p>Without saying a word, Zhu Tianlei moved swiftly, faster than thunder, and struck Li Dacui's trembling shoulder with one palm.</p>

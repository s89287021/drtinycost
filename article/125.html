						<p>Inside Tianlei Pharmaceutical's office, </p><p>Mao Yu sat opposite Zhu Tianlei, staring at him with a mischievous smile without saying a word. This state had lasted for nearly ten minutes.</p><p>Even someone as thick-skinned as Zhu Tianlei, whose skin was thicker than the bottom of his shoes, found himself uneasy under Mao Yu's gaze.</p><p>"I say, Mr. Advisor Mao, don't you have a crush on me? I'm not interested in you, so don't get any ideas."</p><p>"Pfft!"</p><p>Mao Yu's large eyes widened as she spat at Zhu Tianlei, though there was no sign of anger.</p><p>"What I was thinking is that given your prowess, we can fire the two PR specialists in our marketing department. Your crisis management skills are something even this corporate advisor admires!"</p><p>Later that day, Mao Yu chased after Zhu Tianlei but stayed on the outskirts without entering. One reason was that she hadn't thought of a safe response yet, and another was seeing Zhu Tianlei wink at her.</p><p>To be honest, such a situation would be challenging for anyone, especially someone as inexperienced in business as Zhu Tianlei. Even Mao Yu herself wasn't confident about handling it.</p><p>However, not only did Zhu Tianlei manage it, but he also turned what could have been an extremely dangerous corporate crisis into a public relations coup for both the company and himself. It was worth noting that inserting a commercial into the Yunhai People's Livelihood program cost 130,000 yuan per second, yet Zhu Tianlei managed to secure an entire episode for free. Such talent truly impressed Mao Yu.</p><p>"Stop putting me down, okay? I know my strengths just as well as you do. It was mere luck on my part, and besides, you were the true hero. If you hadn't insisted on reporting each batch of medicines to the drug administration and applying for patents for each type, all my words would have been in vain."</p><p>"Hahaha, Zhu Tianlei, you've got guts!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei let out a self-satisfied snort. It was no joke; after being with Mao Yu for nearly four months, he should understand her personality well.</p><p>However, soon enough, Mao Yu's expression darkened.</p><p>"Tianlei, have you thought about who was pulling the strings behind the scenes?"</p><p>The police had reported that the woman who drugged the little girl wasn't her mother but her aunt. Furthermore, this aunt had been bribed to make the little girl take fake medicine to a pharmacy and even call the TV station herself.</p><p>Inside Tianlei Pharmaceutical's office,</p><p>Mao Yu sat opposite Zhu Tianlei, staring at him with a mischievous smile without uttering a word for nearly ten minutes.

Even someone as thick-skinned as Zhu Tianlei found himself uneasy under Mao Yu's intense gaze.</p><p>"I say, Advisor Mao, don't you have a crush on me? I'm not interested in you, so don't get any ideas," he said playfully.</p><p>"Pfft!"</p><p>Mao Yu's large eyes widened comically as she spat at Zhu Tianlei, though there was no sign of anger.

Furthermore, this aunt had been bribed to make the little girl take fake medicine to a pharmacy and even call the TV station herself.</p><p>However, this aunt was too wicked. Not only did she give the girl fake medicine, but she also deceived her into eating panther grass, hoping to get rid of this useless burden through this incident. However, she ended up running into Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>There was no need for conjecture; the person who hired this aunt must have had his eyes on Tianlei Pharmaceuticals, or more precisely, Zhu Tianlei himself.</p><p>"I've been thinking about it too, but I haven't figured anything out yet. However, this incident is likely to be orchestrated by the same person who made those pharmacies refuse to sell our products simultaneously."</p><p>Mao Yu raised an eyebrow, not expecting that Zhu Tianlei would think of this. Indeed, these two events must have been carried out by the same person.</p><p>"Tianlei, we are in the light while the enemy is in the shadows; we can't afford to be complacent!"</p><p>Mao Yu was acutely aware of the ruthless nature of commercial competition. Some people were willing to kill and steal for personal gain, let alone Zhu Tianlei, who had risen to prominence in just over a month, making Tianlei Pharmaceuticals the leader in the pharmaceutical industry of Yunhai City.</p><p>The more popular one becomes, the more trouble they attract. Each competitor could potentially be a hidden black hand behind the scenes.</p><p>"I understand this principle, but if we keep waiting for them to make their move, we'll only be at their mercy. How about we take the initiative?"</p><p>"Take the initiative?"</p><p>"Yes, like using grass to beat rabbits."</p><p>...</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>A poster appeared on Tianlei Pharmaceuticals' official website, mainly promoting a recruitment drive.</p><p>Although Hao Xinmei had become the exclusive agent for Beauty Pill, sales of other medications were not very promising. Therefore, expanding the market and recruiting agents became a critical step.</p><p>Tu Feng was an outstanding planner, and his entire recruitment strategy was flawless.</p><p>Not long after the poster went up, the consultation hotline in the marketing department rang non-stop. Several clerical staff members took calls one after another without pause. By noon, the number of potential clients who signed up for the recruitment event had reached sixty.</p><p>This number far exceeded Mao Yu's expectations. As a newly established company, their market investment was insufficient and the brand was weak. To be accepted by those seasoned and exceptionally shrewd agents was unimaginably difficult.</p><p>However, this was precisely what happened. By evening, the number of applicants had already surpassed two hundred people.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, just who are you?"</p><p>After discussing the progress of the business conference that evening, Zhu Tianlei planned to go home. Although Mao Yu temporarily stayed in the dormitory, she followed Zhu Tianlei as well.</p><p>"A man, I guess!"</p><p>"I previously thought you were just a little hoodlum. That's why when General Min told me to help you with your company procedures, I was particularly reluctant in my heart. Unexpectedly, as time passed, you were like a gem buried in sand, slowly revealing its original luster, though that luster was merely ten percent or even less..."</p><p>Mao Yu's voice wasn't loud, but it was especially clear against the village night breeze.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had a smile on his lips. Being praised by this goddess was truly delightful!</p><p>Behind them, the newly designed factory flag fluttered in the wind. A large red banner broke convention by being displayed alongside the factory flag and national flag, wildly dancing under the night sky.</p><p>Since the company had just started, Zhu Tianlei, as the new president, needed to learn and worry about too many things. Although he was close by, he hadn't spent intimate moments with Ma Lanlan, Zhang Yuntao, or Yang Xiaoxue for half a month straight.</p><p>Taking advantage of the intoxicating night, after parting ways with Mao Yu, Zhu Tianlei followed the village's small path all the way east, where Zhang Yuntao lived.</p><p>On the day of the grand opening ceremony, despite Zhu Tianlei's efforts to protect her, Zhang Yuntao's sensitive self-esteem was still hurt. Afterward, whenever Zhu Tianlei sent messages to Zhang Yuntao, she didn't reply.</p><p>Standing outside Zhang Yuntao's courtyard gate at this moment, Zhu Tianlei still had a bit of the naivety of a young man.</p><p>"Yuntao, I'm at the gate."</p><p>Five minutes passed after sending the message with no response.</p><p>"Yun Tao, I know you're at home. I miss you."</p><p>Five minutes later, the gate of Zhang Yun Tao's courtyard remained tightly closed.</p><p>Zhu Tian Lei sighed, feeling somewhat helpless. Zhang Yun Tao's heart was truly deep-rooted, and it seemed that opening his heart would not be achieved in just a few days.</p><p>Zhu Tian Lei turned to leave, but when his gaze fell on the shadow cast by the moonlight, an unexpected panic suddenly changed his mind.</p><p>His eyes swept over the dilapidated wooden gate, then he placed his palm on the wall. His body, like a swift, instantly landed in the courtyard.</p><p>The main house was lit up, casting a black shadow larger than life under the light. The figure bent down and lowered their head; the dark silhouette seemed like a fierce beast, instantly dispelling Zhu Tian Lei's calmness.</p>

						<p>"Uncle Ma?"</p><p>Looking at Uncle Ma Chuanlin, who was standing in front of him and breathing heavily.</p><p>"Tianlei, do you know where Lanlan has gone?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback. What did he mean?</p><p>Ma Lanlan usually worked at the clinic from 7:30 AM to 5 PM. He had been coming to the clinic for half a month and had never seen Uncle Ma Chuanlin or Niao Fengyun come looking for Ma Lanlan. Could something have happened at home?</p><p>"Uncle, I'm looking for Lanlan too!"</p><p>"Sigh, this girl doesn't know where she's gone off to. She called home in the middle of the day saying she was going on a house call and might be back later, telling me and your aunt not to wait for her."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned; this didn't seem like Ma Lanlan's usual behavior at all. Ma Lanlan had an independent personality and made most decisions herself without seeking others' opinions or procrastinating. Even when it came to her parents or Zhu Tianlei, she was the same.</p><p>So, it was strange that she would specifically call home to say she was going on a house call. Moreover, the places where she did house calls were in nearby villages; even if it took two hours round trip by electric scooter, why would she need to mention that she might be back late?</p><p>"Uncle, don't worry yet. I'll call and ask...."</p><p>"Oh, foolish child, if I could reach her on the phone, I wouldn't be worried. Just now, that girl called home again, but when the phone rang, there was no answer. When I tried calling back, it went straight to voicemail."</p><p>Ma Chuanlin scratched his ear and face in anxiety, his old face turning red. He had only one precious daughter whom he had raised with care from a young age. If anything happened to her, he would not be able to live.</p><p>After hearing Ma Chuanlin's words, Zhu Tianlei was no less anxious than Ma Chuanlin. All the signs suggested that Ma Lanlan was not on a routine house call.</p><p>"Uncle, don't worry, I'll go look for her now. You and Aunt just stay home and wait; listen to the phone. The moment Lanlan calls, let me know right away!"</p><p>"Alright, alright, thank you Tianlei!"</p><p>"Hurry back, Uncle!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not have time to say more to Ma Chuanlin. He had a bad feeling about it.</p><p>Leaving the clinic, Zhu Tianlei headed straight for the village entrance. Generally, leaving the village required going through the entrance, no matter which village one was heading to. Therefore, Zhu Tianlei's first stop was at the village entrance.</p><p>"Grandma, have you seen Ma Lanlan?"</p><p>The young women and housewives in the village usually sat in groups of three or five at the entrance chatting idly, discussing neighbors' gossip.</p><p>"Brat, aren't you wasting your time like a blind man lighting a lantern? You spend every day with that girl, if you don’t know where she is, how could we possibly know? Right?"</p><p>The one speaking was Er Laizi's wife, the village’s cattle breeder. This woman, in her fifties, spoke without any reserve, showing no respect to elders.</p><p>Upon hearing Er Laizi's wife's words, a group of women laughed heartily; even a fool could understand the meaning behind her words.</p><p>Two days ago, he heard Ma Lanlan mention that the secretary of Xiaolianhua Village, Ge Dong, had gallstones and had just undergone surgery in the city, asking her to go there and administer two bottles of intravenous antibiotics.</p><p>Therefore, Zhu Tianlei's first stop was Ge Dong's house in Xiaolianhua Village.</p><p>As the village secretary, it was easy for Zhu Tianlei to find Ge Dong’s home by asking around. It was a five-enterance courtyard with shiny tile-roofed houses. The yard was paved with bricks, clean enough that not even a grass thorn could be seen.</p><p>No one was in the yard.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei walked to the main house and knocked on the door several times, but there was no response. Normally, it would be time for cooking by now; why was there no one at home?</p><p>He knocked again, but there was still no sound from inside.</p><p>Just as he was about to leave and look elsewhere, his eyes caught a glimpse of something red in the shed in the yard. This red color was too familiar; it belonged to Ma Lanlan's electric scooter.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt a surge of panic and without much thought, kicked open the aluminum door with one foot and rushed into the house like the wind.</p><p>The east room, no!</p><p>The west room, no!</p><p>The north room, not there either!</p><p>......</p><p>Zhu Tianlei searched all the rooms but saw no sign of Ma Lanlan or anyone else.</p><p>No, Lanlan must be here. Zhu Tianlei even felt as though he could hear her cries and pleas for help.</p><p>"Lanlan, Lanlan, where are you? It's Tianlei, where are you?"</p><p>Unable to find anyone, Zhu Tianlei shouted loudly from the center of the main room.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a giggling sound coming from the kitchen. Though it lasted only an instant, Zhu Tianlei did not miss it.</p><p>He dashed into the kitchen and immediately saw a loose tile below the grain cabinet. He lifted the tile and instantly smelled a musty odor.</p><p>This was a cellar. In the surrounding villages, it was not uncommon to have cellars built in kitchens. That's why Zhu Tianlei found himself here so quickly.</p><p>"Lanlan, my dear heart, I miss you day and night, I want to press you under me and love you deeply, Lanlan, I will be very gentle......"</p><p>"Ge Dong, you beast! If I dare touch you even once, my boyfriend will make you pay a terrible price!"</p><p>"My dear heart, don't worry, no one knows you're here. Even if I strip you naked and lock you in this cellar for the rest of your life, no one will find you!"</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>Before Ge Dong could finish speaking, he was lifted by his collar.</p><p>"Tiānlěi!"</p><p>"You... who are you, daring to... dare to enter a private residence without permission."</p><p>Ge Dong did not recognize Zhu Tianlei and was extremely shocked by his sudden appearance in his vegetable cellar.</p><p>"Enter a private residence? Let me show you what it means to enter a private residence!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's anger had boiled over. If Xu Mingzhe made him angry but still left some rationality, that rationality had now vanished entirely.</p><p>With a flick of his hand, Ge Dong's body crashed into the pickled cabbage barrel in the corner of the vegetable cellar with a bang. Like a human bomb, the barrel shattered, spilling the pickled cabbage soup all over, drenching Ge Dong and filling the air with an overwhelming stench.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not look at Ge Dong but walked straight to Ma Lanlan's side. Fortunately, he had arrived in time, and Ma Lanlan's clothes were intact. Apart from a hint of fear in her eyes, she had no obvious injuries.</p><p>"Lanlan, I'm sorry, I failed to protect you, I deserve to die!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hugged Ma Lanlan tightly, his feelings of self-reproach, guilt, and heartache overwhelming him like a tidal wave.</p><p>"Tianlei, wuwu... I'm so scared, Tianlei..."</p>

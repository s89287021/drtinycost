						<p>"Cloud Tao, does it hurt here?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's hand was placed on Zhang Yuntao's small abdomen. Zhang Yuntao felt as if a sudden flame had ignited in her stomach, spreading swiftly throughout her entire body.</p><p>"A little... a bit lower..."</p><p>While she was said to be married, she didn't gain much experience beyond what a single woman would have in terms of marital intimacy. During her years as a widow, many had desired her, but none had truly possessed her; Hu Dainiu only touched her through clothing twice.</p><p>So when Zhu Tianlei's hand was placed on her small abdomen, near the most private part of her body, Zhang Yuntao still felt both embarrassed and nervous. Her menstrual cramps had plagued her for several years, making each period feel like half her life was being taken away.</p><p>If not for that, she would never have sought out Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Here?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's hand was less than two fingers away from the triangular area. Zhang Yuntao's heart was pounding so hard it felt ready to leap out of her chest.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's gaze fell on the slightly protruding part of Zhang Yuntao's body, and he subconsciously swallowed.</p><p>His hand gently pressed down, and a soft moan escaped from Zhang Yuntao's throat. The moan was tinged with suppressed pain.</p><p>"Tianlei, maybe we should stop!"</p><p>Hearing her own voice, Zhang Yuntao's face turned completely red. She couldn't bear to look at the desire within herself or fear Zhu Tianlei's disapproval. No one knew that in countless midnight reveries, images of Zhu Tianlei's face and his muscular body filled her mind.</p><p>"Cloud Tao, what more are you embarrassed about with me?"</p><p>"I... I'm afraid you'll laugh at me!"</p><p>"Cloud Tao, does it hurt here?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's hand rested on Zhang Yuntao's small abdomen.

I'm afraid you'll laugh at me!"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao thought for a moment and still decided to speak her mind.</p><p>"You silly woman, why would I joke with you? I'm delighted that you trust me enough to come to me!"</p><p>Having said that, Zhu Tianlei suddenly rose slightly and kissed Zhang Yuntao on her rosy cheek.</p><p>"Yuntao, I want to ask you, when did you start having menstrual cramps?"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao was still immersed in the unexpected kiss and froze for a moment when she heard Zhu Tianlei's question, feeling even more embarrassed afterwards.</p><p>"I started menstruating at sixteen. The first two years weren't painful, but during those few days when my mom passed away, I stayed in the shrine for three days mourning her. Since then, each time it comes, it hurts terribly and the pain gets worse with every cycle."</p><p>Zhang Yuntao recalled that while menstrual cramps weren’t a disease, they could be so excruciating as to make one wish they were dead.</p><p>"I noticed there's a cold energy in your body, quite strong, circulating within your abdomen. This cold energy is likely the cause of your abdominal pain."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei could clearly sense a wave of cold energy surging back and forth in Zhang Yuntao’s abdomen, seemingly evading his hand. Though he had no experience with gynecological illnesses, there was plenty of information on them in Immortal Medical Techniques, though Zhu Tianlei couldn't find a matching condition right away.</p><p>"Cold energy? Do you mean I caught a chill?"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao interpreted this correctly; most women suffering from menstrual cramps had excess cold energy in their bodies, but Zhang Yuntao was an exception.</p><p>"Think carefully. Have you consumed anything unusual? Remember, it must be something special."</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei's question, although Zhang Yuntao found it a bit strange, she recalled with great seriousness.</p><p>"Oh, I remember now. A few days before my mom passed away, I drank some placenta water."</p><p>"Placenta water? Why would you drink that?"</p><p>As a doctor, Zhu Tianlei knew that the placenta was also an effective herbal medicine known as Zihuoxue, primarily used to warm the kidneys, nourish essence, tonify qi, and supplement blood. However, Zhang Yuntao was only in her teens then—how could she have needed Zihuoxue?</p><p>In fact, this matter was Zhang Yuntao's pain.</p><p>Especially after her husband had an accident, she always felt that it was her own fault for harming her man. If not for Zhu Tianlei asking about it, she would never have wanted to bring up the subject.</p><p>"Tianlei, could it be that my stomachache is related to what happened?"</p><p>"I'm not sure, but I guess it must be related. The cold qi in your body can't just be caused by a simple chill. Let me massage you first; at least it will help ease it, and then I'll gradually find the cause of the cold qi."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei quickly went through several thoughts in his mind.</p><p>"Tianlei, would... you reject me or fear being with me?"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao nervously grabbed the hem of her dress. She had just mustered up the courage to tell him about it and wanted to know Zhu Tianlei's attitude.</p><p>"Fear me? You could eat me?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Zhang Yuntao in amusement, finding the cautious woman before him rather adorable in her foolishness.</p><p>Not to mention that Zhu Tianlei didn't believe in fate at all; even if he did, he wouldn't believe that Zhang Yuntao was a life force that would harm her husband and children. The fortune-teller was nothing but an impostor who used the guise of fortune-telling to deceive people.</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei didn't give a direct answer, the smile on his face gave Zhang Yuntao her answer.</p><p>She suddenly felt that God really favored her, giving her such a man.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei massaged while gradually transferring the spiritual energy in his body to Zhang Yuntao's lower abdomen, temporarily driving away the cold qi to another part of her body.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao felt as if Zhu Tianlei's fingers had magical powers. In just four or five minutes, her lower abdomen was warm, and a strange lightness made her forget about the suffering she had been enduring before.</p><p>"Tianlei, you're so good!"</p><p>This matter was Zhang Yuntao's deepest pain.</p><p>Especially after her husband had an accident, she always felt guilty, believing it was her fault that something happened to her man. If Zhu Tianlei hadn't inquired about it, she would have never wanted to bring up the subject again.</p><p>"Tianlei, could my stomachache be related to what happened?"</p><p>"I'm not entirely sure, but I suspect there's a connection. The cold energy inside you can't simply be attributed to catching a chill. Let me massage you first; at least it will help alleviate the pain. Then, I'll try to find out the source of the cold energy."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's mind raced with thoughts.</p><p>"Tianlei, would... you reject me or fear being with me?"</p><p>Nervously clutching the hem of her dress, Zhang Yuntao had just mustered the courage to tell Zhu Tianlei about it and wanted to gauge his reaction.</p><p>"Fear me? You could eat me?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Zhang Yuntao with amusement, finding the cautious woman before him rather adorable in her naivety.</p><p>Even if he believed in fate, Zhu Tianlei wouldn't believe that Zhang Yuntao was destined to bring misfortune to her husband and children. The fortune-teller was nothing more than a charlatan using divination as a pretext for deception.</p><p>Though Zhu Tianlei didn't give a direct answer, his smile conveyed the answer she needed.</p><p>She suddenly felt grateful to God for giving her such a man.</p><p>As he massaged, Zhu Tianlei gradually transferred the spiritual energy from his body to Zhang Yuntao's lower abdomen, temporarily driving away the cold qi to another part of her body.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao felt as if Zhu Tianlei's fingers possessed magical powers. In just four or five minutes, her lower abdomen warmed up, and a strange sense of relief made her momentarily forget about her previous suffering.</p><p>"Tianlei, you're so good!"</p><p>This matter had become Zhang Yuntao's deepest pain.</p><p>Especially after her husband's accident, she felt it was all her fault, believing she had caused harm to her man. If Zhu Tianlei hadn't inquired about it, she would have never wanted to bring up the subject again.</p><p>"Tianlei, could my stomachache be related to what happened?"</p><p>"I'm not certain, but I suspect there is a connection. The cold energy within you can't simply be attributed to catching a chill. Let me massage you first; at least it will help ease the pain. Then, I'll try to identify the source of the cold energy."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's thoughts raced through his mind.</p><p>"Tianlei, would... you reject me or fear being with me?"</p><p>Nervously clutching the hem of her dress, Zhang Yuntao had just mustered the courage to tell Zhu Tianlei about it and wanted to gauge his reaction.</p><p>"Fear you? You could eat me?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Zhang Yuntao with amusement, finding the cautious woman before him rather adorable in her naivety.</p><p>Even if he believed in fate, Zhu Tianlei wouldn't believe that Zhang Yuntao was destined to bring misfortune to her husband and children. The fortune-teller was nothing more than a charlatan using divination as a pretext for deception.</p><p>Though Zhu Tianlei didn't give a direct answer, his smile conveyed the answer she needed.</p><p>She suddenly felt grateful to God for giving her such a man.</p><p>As he massaged, Zhu Tianlei gradually transferred the spiritual energy from his body to Zhang Yuntao's lower abdomen, temporarily driving away the cold qi to another part of her body.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao felt as if Zhu Tianlei's fingers possessed magical powers. In just four or five minutes, her lower abdomen warmed up, and a strange sense of relief made her momentarily forget about her previous suffering.</p><p>"Tianlei, you're so good!"</p><p>When Zhang Yuntao sat up, he looked at Zhu Tianlei and shyly said,</p><p>"Is that it?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was in a good mood and wanted to tease Zhang Yuntao.</p><p>"Well... I..."</p><p>Zhang Yuntao hesitated for a moment, suddenly lifted her head, and her red lips firmly landed on Zhu Tianlei's lips.</p><p>The sky collapsed and the mountains turned upside down.</p><p>Although it was just a light kiss, Zhu Tianlei felt like an inexperienced child. It wasn't until Zhang Yuntao ran out of the woods that Zhu Tianlei came to his senses.</p><p>Sigh!</p><p>It seems he really has no resistance against women!</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei returned to the clinic, he saw Ma Lanlan bending over and mopping the floor.</p><p>Ma Lanlan was wearing black stockings inside her snow-white nurse's uniform today, which made her look even more sexy and alluring. As she moved while cleaning, her slim waist and round hips triggered endless fantasies in one's mind.</p><p>"Tianlei!"</p><p>Feeling his waist suddenly hugged by someone, Ma Lanlan didn't panic. After the last time they nearly crossed a line, Ma Lanlan had grown used to Zhu Tianlei's such actions.</p><p>On the other hand, every time Zhu Tianlei held her, he found it both bitter and sweet.</p>

						<p>"Alright!"</p><p>At this meeting, the two people only said these three sentences.</p><p>Watching Jiang Haitao's departing figure, Zhu Tianlei silently wished for this man who had finally come to his senses.</p><p>If it weren't for that night when Jiang Haitao told him about someone wanting to use Wu Xiaohui's death to frame him, he might not have prepared in advance and might have been dragged into the situation by Tang Wen.</p><p>However, Zhu Tianlei refused all interviews.</p><p>The more so, people's desire to know about Zhu Tianlei grew even stronger.</p><p>Due to Tang Wen's infringement, his submitted patent application was naturally invalidated, while a new patent certificate was issued through a fast-track process a few days later.</p><p>The patent application was not made by Zhu Tianlei himself but by the National Disease Control Center.</p><p>The harm and terror of Dengluolin virus were evident to all, and Zhu Tianlei's contributions were self-evident.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei saw the name of the drug on the patent certificate, he felt a momentary shock.</p><p>"Three Stones Star."</p><p>Three stones, lei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's pharmaceutical company was designated as the sole producer of Three Stones Star.</p><p>All employees at Tianlei Pharmaceutical were like they had been injected with adrenaline, feeling honored to work alongside Zhu Tianlei, this great hero who benefited all humanity.</p><p>For half a month straight, the production workshop at Tianlei Pharmaceutical operated non-stop, even late into the night without any pauses.</p><p>Every day, several large cargo vans parked early at the entrance of Tianlei Pharmaceutical's factory. One box after another of San Shi Xing Zhen, carrying the workers' body heat, was loaded onto the vans and quickly shipped to all parts of the country.</p><p>A month later, Zhu Tianlei received a letter.</p><p>It was a joint report from the National Disease Control Center and the Ministry of Health titled 'Regarding the Recovery of Dengluolin Virus Infections.' Due to the introduction of San Shi Xing Zhen, no further death cases were reported, which could indeed be considered a medical miracle.</p><p>Time flew by, and before he knew it, it was already Light Snow.</p><p>Tianlei Pharmaceutical's factory had undergone one expansion, and the two mu of land remaining on the beam had also been requisitioned. Seeing the development prospects of Tianlei Pharmaceutical and the substantial compensation received from previous land transfers, almost everyone rushed to sign the agreement for these two mu.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sat in a persimmon grove behind the factory, looking at the flag waving from the factory area's flagpole. The banner had been replaced countless times, but Zhu Tianlei remembered the first one most vividly. After all, the first time was always special and unforgettable.</p><p>Suddenly, Zhu Tianlei felt a chill on his face. He looked up to see that it was snowing.</p><p>The first snow of winter arrived silently like this.</p><p>No one had expected that the snow would continue for three days straight.</p><p>Blanketed in heavy snow, Dahuangshan appeared completely white from afar, with snow up to people's knees on the roads, confining most villagers to their homes. Tianlei Pharmaceutical was also forced to halt production.</p><p>However, Zhu Tianlei wasn't too concerned about the shutdown; the inventory in the warehouse was sufficient to meet short-term market demands.</p><p>What truly worried him was his medicinal fields.</p><p>He had visited them several times before, worried that the cold winter would freeze the herbs. Thankfully, his concerns didn't come true.</p><p>But such heavy snow...</p><p>The more he worried, the less Zhu Tianlei could sit still. He decided to head straight for Xiaohei Stream through the snow.</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was about to reach Xiaohei Stream, he suddenly noticed two rows of deep and shallow footprints on the ground.</p><p>In such weather, how could anyone come to Xiaohexi?</p><p>This discovery made Zhu Tianlei involuntarily speed up. His speed was already fast; now it was almost like walking on snow, leaving faint traces as he passed.</p><p>When he arrived at the herb field, he just saw a dark shadow bending over and moving through the field.</p><p>The heavy snow covered the entire herb field. The shadow was clearly searching for something, advancing with great difficulty but cautiously. It seemed she was very familiar with the medicinal herbs.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei silently approached.</p><p>"What are you looking for?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's sudden appearance startled the dark shadow.</p><p>It's a woman?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei never would have thought that this person wearing a pitch-black robe was actually a woman, and she looked quite young.</p><p>"I......waah......"</p><p>The girl pouted her lips and burst into tears before she could even speak, startling Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>What's going on here?</p><p>And he didn't expect the girl to cry so much. Once she started crying, she couldn't stop. As time passed, Zhu Tianlei rubbed his temples.</p><p>"Auntie, please don't cry! If anyone saw that, they'd think I was doing something to you!"</p><p>"I'm hungry......"</p><p>The girl listened and immediately stopped crying, but her face, frozen pale with tears hanging on it, truly looked...... heart-wrenching.</p><p>In such weather, how could anyone come to Xiaohexi?</p><p>This discovery made Zhu Tianlei involuntarily quicken his pace. Already swift, he now moved almost as if walking on snow, leaving barely visible traces behind him.</p><p>When he reached the herb field, he caught sight of a dark figure bending over and weaving through it.</p><p>The heavy snow blanketed the entire herb field. The shadow was clearly searching for something, moving with great effort but with utmost care. It seemed she was very familiar with the medicinal herbs.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei silently approached.</p><p>"What are you looking for?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's sudden appearance startled the dark figure.</p><p>It's a woman?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei could hardly believe that this person in pitch-black robes was actually a young woman.</p><p>"I......waah......"</p><p>The girl pouted, breaking into tears before she even spoke, which shocked Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>What on earth is happening here?</p><p>And he didn't expect the girl to cry so intensely. Once she started, she couldn't stop. As time ticked by, Zhu Tianlei rubbed his temples.</p><p>"Auntie, please don't cry! If anyone saw that, they'd think I was doing something to you!"</p><p>"I'm hungry......"</p><p>The girl listened and stopped crying immediately, but her face, pale from the cold and tears streaming down it, truly looked...... heart-wrenching.</p><p>In such harsh weather, how could anyone be found at Xiaohexi?</p><p>This realization made Zhu Tianlei quicken his pace even more. His already swift movements were now almost like gliding over snow, leaving barely visible tracks behind him.</p><p>By the time he reached the herb field, he saw a dark figure bending over and weaving through it.</p><p>The heavy snow blanketed the entire herb field, and the dark figure was clearly searching for something. She moved with great difficulty but with utmost caution, suggesting that she was very familiar with the medicinal herbs.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei silently approached.</p><p>"What are you looking for?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's sudden appearance startled the dark figure.</p><p>It's a woman?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei could hardly believe that this person in pitch-black robes was actually a young woman.</p><p>"I......waah......"</p><p>The girl pouted, breaking into tears before she even spoke, which shocked Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>What on earth is happening here?</p><p>And he didn't expect the girl to cry so intensely.

If anyone saw that, they'd think I was doing something to you!"</p><p>"I'm hungry......"</p><p>The girl listened and stopped crying immediately, but her face, pale from the cold with tears streaming down it, truly looked...... heart-wrenching.</p><p>"That... you got lost?"</p><p>This was the most plausible reason Zhu Tianlei could think of. Who else's little girl would be wandering outside in such weather, and dressed so strangely?</p><p>"I'm hungry... I want to find something to eat!"</p><p>The girl sniffled as she said this, then lowered her head and suddenly pulled out a ginseng root from the medicine field.</p><p>"Oh great, carrots!"</p><p>Watching the girl excitedly take a big bite of the ginseng, Zhu Tianlei was heartbroken almost to the point of biting his own tongue off.</p><p>G-Ginseng... This ginseng plant was in excellent condition. If sold at market, it would be worth at least tens of thousands of yuan. It had been eaten as if it were a carrot.</p><p>"There are still carrots! Today is my lucky day!"</p><p>Seeing the girl reaching for another ginseng root, Zhu Tianlei's hair stood on end with fear. He felt that the girl's action of pulling out ginseng seemed so familiar.</p><p>"Do you ask me, do you often come here to... eat carrots?"</p><p>"Yes, the carrots here are really delicious, very crispy. Besides this big carrot, there are also small carrots, but they're not as tasty..."</p><p>"And sweet potatoes..."</p><p>"Small taro bulbs..."</p><p>"That... you got lost?"</p><p>This was the most plausible reason Zhu Tianlei could think of. Who else's little girl would be wandering outside in such weather, and dressed so strangely?</p><p>"I'm hungry...

He almost wanted to bite his own tongue off in distress.</p><p>G-Ginseng... This ginseng plant was in perfect condition. If sold at market, it would be worth tens of thousands of yuan. It had been eaten as if it were a carrot.</p><p>"There are still carrots! Today is my lucky day!"</p><p>Seeing the girl reaching for another ginseng root, Zhu Tianlei's hair stood on end with fear. He felt that her action of pulling out ginseng was eerily familiar.</p><p>"Do you ask me, do you often come here to... eat carrots?"</p><p>"Yes, the carrots here are really delicious, very crispy. Besides this big carrot, there are also small carrots, but they're not as tasty..."</p><p>"And sweet potatoes..."</p><p>"Small taro bulbs..."</p><p>Looking at the girl's serious face as she counted her fingers, Zhu Tianlei wanted to let out a long howl.</p><p>Heaven!</p><p>"Auntie, do you... know where your home is? I'll take you back!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei considered himself a person who viewed wealth and material possessions as extraneous, and one who pitied the beautiful. However, in front of this maid who treated ginseng like turnips, Zhu Tianlei simply could not pity her.</p><p>"Waaah......"</p><p>Unexpectedly, the girl began to cry loudly again, her wailing so intense that it seemed to darken the sky and sadden all the trees and plants. It made Zhu Tianlei roll his eyes repeatedly.</p><p>"Stop!"</p><p>Unable to tolerate it any longer, Zhu Tianlei shouted, and the girl's sobbing abruptly ceased. Her puffy red eyes looked at him, but before he could say anything to ease her distress, the crying started again, this time piercing through the clouds.</p><p>"Auntie, little sister, beautiful lady, let's talk about it, will you stop crying......"</p><p>"Waaah......"</p><p>"Little sister, how about this: aren't you hungry? I'll take you to eat something delicious, okay?"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stared in disbelief at the girl who suddenly stopped crying. He felt like he hadn't checked his calendar today.</p>

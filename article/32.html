						<p>"Do you want to start a pharmaceutical factory?"</p><p>In the conversation, Zhu Tianlei inadvertently expressed his thoughts, but he didn't expect it would make Hao Xinmei extremely excited.</p><p>"Yes, Huangmagou is located in a deep mountain, with medicinal herbs covering the hills. It's very convenient to gather materials, and moreover, most of the medicines sold on the market are Western drugs. While we don't know about their efficacy, long-term consumption has strong side effects on the body. Therefore, I want to establish a pharmaceutical factory that only produces traditional Chinese medicine."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had been thinking about this idea for many days. Although he was now highly skilled in medicine, he hadn't dealt with such things before, and his thoughts were all over the place.</p><p>"You're saying that Western drugs are convenient to use and more effective compared to traditional Chinese medicine. More than 70% or even 80% of the market share is occupied by Western drugs. It's not easy for traditional Chinese medicine to break through."</p><p>Hao Xinmei herself runs a pharmaceutical company, with an extremely in-depth understanding of the pharmaceutical industry. However, Hao Xinmei does pharmaceutical agency work and doesn't have her own manufacturing plant.</p><p>"I know that, but traditional Chinese medicine is what our ancestors left us. After thousands of years, it can be described as profound and extensive. We cannot discard it. Moreover, you saw the situation in Huangmagou; besides relying on the heavens for food, they can only catch some frogs to earn a little pocket money. The villagers don't have a prosperous life, so I want to start a pharmaceutical factory to help them live better."</p><p>After hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, Hao Xinmei showed approval on her face. She found that Zhu Tianlei was like a pearl buried in gravel; the more she brushed away the sand, the brighter he shone.</p><p>"Tianlei, I support you!"</p><p>These words came from the bottom of Hao Xinmei's heart.</p><p>A man not only thinks about starting his own business but also considers benefiting the village. Such a magnanimous spirit is what Hao Xinmei admires greatly.</p><p>"Haha, to get President Hao's support is truly not easy! I feel incredibly fortunate!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei could not miss Hao Xinmei's intentions, but only he knew how difficult this path would be. At least, after walking for several days in the mountains and Black Tiger Forest, he found very few medicinal herbs. If they couldn't use local resources, the advantage of starting a pharmaceutical factory would be greatly diminished, and costs would increase exponentially. He currently had no money, not even to buy the materials, let alone start a factory.</p><p>But these things he didn't want to tell Hao Xinmei, unable to bear seeing the hope and approval in her eyes become an illusion, instantly shattering.</p><p>"With President Hao's support, my confidence has doubled!"</p><p>The two of them had a very enjoyable conversation. Hao Xinmei offered many suggestions and opinions, and Zhu Tianlei felt he benefited greatly from it. Before he knew it, it was already the time they had agreed with Yang Xiaoxue to meet.</p><p>"Little Mei, I have an appointment with someone at the bus station at two o'clock. I need to leave now and will call you later!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei got up, feeling a bit reluctant. The Hao Xinmei he had just seen had finally removed her icy, cold facade that kept people away, as if she were covered in a warm layer of silver light, making it impossible to look away.</p><p>Refusing Hao Xinmei's offer to drive him, Zhu Tianlei glanced at his watch and sped towards the bus station. Fortunately, he arrived before Yang Xiaoxue did.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sighed in relief. If he had been later than Yang Xiaoxue, she would definitely have teased him for it.</p><p>However, just a few minutes later, a taxi screeched to a halt in front of Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>The car door opened, and a short-haired girl got out of the vehicle. The girl had a round face and big black eyes like grapes. She was petite and wore a set of light gray workout clothes, radiating with youthful energy.</p><p>"Are you Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback. This girl knew his name?</p><p>"I am Zhu Tianlei, who are you?"</p><p>The short-haired girl took steps towards Zhu Tianlei. She was very small, so she had to look up at him the whole time she examined him.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt a bit uneasy being stared at by this little girl. He didn't deny that she was pretty and adorable with her fluffy appearance, but it was obvious she was young, and Zhu Tianlei did not have any perverted interest in molesting minors.</p><p>"You look quite average. Hey, are you my sister's boyfriend?"</p><p>Eh!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was dumbfounded. Where had this little girl come from? Would a brother-in-law just randomly take anyone as his sister's boyfriend?</p><p>"Are you Xiaoxue's younger sister?"</p><p>A light bulb went off in Zhu Tianlei's head, and he suddenly guessed the identity of this little girl.</p><p>"Little Mei, I have an appointment with someone at the bus station at two o'clock. I need to leave now and will call you later!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei got up, feeling a bit reluctant. The Hao Xinmei he had just seen had finally removed her icy, cold facade that kept people away, as if she were covered in a warm layer of silver light, making it impossible to look away.</p><p>Refusing Hao Xinmei's offer to drive him, Zhu Tianlei glanced at his watch and sped towards the bus station.

She had a round face and big black eyes like grapes. She was petite and wore a set of light gray workout clothes, radiating with youthful energy.</p><p>"Are you Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback. This girl knew his name?</p><p>"I am Zhu Tianlei. Who are you?"</p><p>The short-haired girl took steps towards Zhu Tianlei. She was very small, so she had to look up at him the whole time as she examined him.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt a bit uneasy being stared at by this little girl. He didn't deny that she was pretty and adorable with her fluffy appearance, but it was obvious she was young, and Zhu Tianlei did not have any perverted interest in molesting minors.</p><p>"You look quite average.

I need to leave now and will call you later!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei got up, feeling a bit reluctant. The Hao Xinmei he had just seen had finally shed her icy, aloof facade, as if she were bathed in a warm silver glow that made it impossible to look away.</p><p>Refusing Hao Xinmei's offer to give him a ride, Zhu Tianlei glanced at his watch and sped towards the bus station. Fortunately, he arrived before Yang Xiaoxue did.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei breathed a sigh of relief. If he had been later than Yang Xiaoxue, she would have surely teased him.</p><p>However, just a few minutes later, a taxi screeched to a halt in front of Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>The car door opened, and a short-haired girl stepped out. She had a round face and big black eyes like grapes. Petite and wearing light gray workout clothes, she exuded youthful vitality.</p><p>"Are you Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback. This girl knew his name?</p><p>"I am Zhu Tianlei. Who are you?"</p><p>The short-haired girl approached Zhu Tianlei, her small stature requiring her to look up at him as she sized him up.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt slightly uneasy under her gaze. He didn't deny that she was pretty and endearing with her fluffy appearance, but it was clear she was young, and Zhu Tianlei had no interest in anything perverted involving minors.</p><p>"You look quite average. Hey, are you my sister's boyfriend?"</p><p>Eh!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was dumbfounded. Where had this little girl come from? Would a brother-in-law just randomly take anyone as his sister's boyfriend?</p><p>"Are you Xiaoxue's younger sister?"</p><p>A light bulb went off in Zhu Tianlei's head, and he suddenly guessed the identity of this little girl.</p><p>"Consider yourself smart. Listen, my sister is the kindest and gentlest person in the world. You must be good to her, take care of her, pamper her, and love her. If you dare to mistreat her, I will chase you to the ends of the earth and never let you go!"</p><p>The maid said this while waving her fist, looking fiercely angry. Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but chuckle secretly.</p><p>That's odd; how did this maid know he was Yang Xiaoxue's boyfriend? Could it be that Yang Xiaoxue told her?</p><p>Haha, if that's the case, does that mean Yang Xiaoxue admitted to being his girlfriend?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt excited at the thought. He didn't expect such a significant discovery from just visiting Yunhai City.</p><p>"Xiaochen, why are you here?"</p><p>From afar, Yang Xiaoxue came walking with a huge pink luggage bag in tow. Zhu Tianlei hurried over and took the bag cheerfully from her hands.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue glanced at Zhu Tianlei, feeling his expression seemed strange. It must be that stinky brat Yang Xiaochen had told him something.</p><p>"Hehe, sis, I'm just going to class, happened to pass by here. You two can chat; I'll go to class now!"</p><p>After saying this, Yang Xiaochen darted away, giving Zhu Tianlei a nakedly threatening look before turning around.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei laughed until his eyes almost closed.</p><p>"Hey, what are you laughing at?"</p><p>The returning bus was still driven by Li Dongkui, but from the moment Zhu Tianlei got in, Li Dongkui and his wife dared not meet Zhu Tianlei's gaze.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't bother to respond. He and Yang Xiaoxue picked a window seat, fortunate that there weren't many passengers returning, making the air inside the bus much better than when they had departed.</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei laugh foolishly for so long, Yang Xiaoxue couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"Wife, you can rest assured. I will definitely take care of you, pamper you, love you, and be good to you for life!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei approached, whispering in Yang Xiaoxue's ear.</p><p>"You...... rogue!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue's face instantly turned as red as paper. She spat out a retort angrily, but a sweet honey-like feeling surged in her heart, as sweet as sugar.</p><p>Without any hitches from the previous incidents, the bus journey went smoothly, and they arrived at the village in less than two and a half hours.</p><p>After dropping Yang Xiaoxue off at her accommodation, Zhu Tianlei stumbled his way home.</p><p>The events of today made him feel elated both mentally and physically, with a smile that refused to fade from his lips.</p><p>Before he even reached his front door, he ran into the village chief, Yao Gang.</p><p>"Hey Tianlei, I was just on my way to your place!"</p>

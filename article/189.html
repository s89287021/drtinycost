						<p>"Big Brother, you make a good point. Then... can I see where we supply from? Although my business isn't big, I can still buy at least three or four thousand boxes per month. If it turns out to be a fake company, I'll be in trouble!"</p><p>Upon hearing that Zhu Tianlei could purchase several thousand boxes per month, the short man's eyes lit up instantly.</p><p>"Brother, your concerns are understood by this elder brother. Don't worry; as long as Brother can make up his mind, I will take you two to the company right now."</p><p>"Big Brother, wait a moment! Let us discuss!"</p><p>After Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, he pulled Maoyu to one side. The short man squinted his eyes, assuming that the two were a couple running a family business, so he didn't think much of it and even felt more reassured.</p><p>"Xiaoyu, cooperate with me for a moment, okay?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei lowered his voice, knowing Maoyu was intelligent but also aware of her fiery temper, hence his warning.</p><p>"I got it, I understand!"</p><p>Maoyu rolled her eyes at Zhu Tianlei, did she look so unreliable? She was indeed angry, but she understood what Zhu Tianlei was doing.</p><p>"Hehe, you have to play my wife!"</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you......"</p><p>Maoyu's face turned red upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words. Although she knew he was joking, her heart still raced uncontrollably.</p><p>However, Zhu Tianlei moved quickly, not giving Maoyu a chance to react, and dashed out, which looked like a couple bickering in the eyes of the short man.</p><p>"Brother, you were scolded by your wife, huh?"</p><p>"Haha, Big Brother, you are clearly an experienced one. No worries, I make decisions at home, so it's settled. Give me an account number, and I'll transfer you five thousand yuan as a deposit first."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei chuckled and laughed heartily, followed by the short man.</p><p>"Little Brother, be generous; you’re a man who handles big things. Don’t worry, I won’t cheat you. We’ll make money together!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei transferred 5000 yuan to the account provided by the short guy. About two or three minutes later, someone called to collect the payment, and the short guy led Zhu Tianlei out of the alley with a smile on his face.</p><p>These 5000 yuan quickly brought Zhu Tianlei and Mao Yu into the short guy’s camp without any reservations.</p><p>The short guy led the two men around the alley for about seven or eight minutes before they finally exited, standing in front of a three-story building.</p><p>This was an ordinary residential building with cement walls, a red cement tile roof, and a large iron gate at the entrance. The gate was locked, and there was a man in his forties guarding it. Upon seeing Zhu Tianlei, he widened his eyes in suspicion.</p><p>"Old Ma, hurry up and open the door; we have a big client!"</p><p>"Are these two clients?"</p><p>The middle-aged man was cautious, sizing up Zhu Tianlei and Mao Yu while asking the short guy.</p><p>"Oh no doubt about it; we’ve already received the deposit. Open the door!"</p><p>The short guy seemed quite anxious, fearing that this middle-aged man would upset his newly acquired big client.</p><p>"Ah, okay, I’m just doing my job, after all."</p><p>Middle-aged Mr. Ma smiled and swung open the iron gate with a whoosh.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei and Mao Yu walked side by side, following the short guy into the building.</p><p>Though unremarkable from the outside, the small building held surprises inside.</p><p>The building was empty; the walls had been knocked down, repainted white with latex paint, and lined with two rows of medicine shelves. The shelves were neatly arranged with dozens of large medicinal baskets filled with raw herbs.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced over and found that the quality of the herbs was quite good, at least above average.</p><p>Moreover, the medicinal materials were very clean, indicating that the person managing them was meticulous and very familiar with the materials.</p><p>Walking up to the second floor, he could hear the rumbling sound of machinery. Judging from the noise, the machine was not large; it should be a small-scale pharmaceutical processing unit.</p><p>"Little brother, we’re almost there, I guarantee you’ll feel reassured!"</p><p>The short man kept walking while turning back to continue making assurances to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded and smiled without saying anything.</p><p>On the second floor, it was also a huge empty room with gray tiles shining like mirrors on the ground. Several small grinders and processing units were in operation, and more than ten workers wearing white-gray uniforms, masks, and dust caps stood by the machines, proficiently doing their respective jobs.</p><p>On the packaging workbench, there lay the packaging boxes for Qingdan Pills.</p><p>"How about it? Little brother, are you reassured now?"</p><p>Seeing the surprise in Zhu Tianlei's eyes, the short man felt somewhat proud. He was very confident about this transaction.</p><p>"Where’s your boss? I want to meet him!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei withdrew his gaze and looked at the short man.</p><p>"The boss..."</p><p>"How come? Is it inconvenient for you?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei’s expression turned slightly stern.</p><p>"No no, of course not. It's just that our boss has a somewhat eccentric personality; I'm afraid I might offend you, little brother!"</p><p>The short man noticed Zhu Tianlei's expression change and quickly offered a smile and explanation.</p><p>"There's nothing wrong, I'm just a businessman who cares about profits. As long as the boss is mad enough to allow me to make money, it's fine!"</p><p>"Alright, then you two wait here for a moment while I go up to talk to the boss!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded; this was a good opportunity to observe more closely.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>Suddenly, a large and muscular man came upstairs from the staircase and charged at Mao Yu.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei instinctively turned around and shielded Mao Yu behind him.</p><p>"Who are you two, daring to record? Hand over your phones!"</p><p>The man had a face covered in scars, and seeing Mao Yu behind Zhu Tianlei, he said menacingly.</p><p>It turned out that Mao Yu had secretly taken his phone to record the production process in the workshop, only for this man to discover it.</p><p>"We are customers here to conduct an inspection. Recording is just so we can understand your production processes better. There's no need to be so nervous, right?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said coolly.</p><p>"Customers? Even if you were the Son of Heaven himself, it wouldn't work. Hand over your phone!"</p><p>The man was extremely aggressive and completely ignored what Zhu Tianlei had said.</p><p>"I won't hand it over. The phone is mine. What right do you have to demand that I give it to you? And, this is how you treat your customers?"</p><p>Mao Yu peered out from behind Zhu Tianlei and shouted fiercely.</p><p>The short man noticed Zhu Tianlei's expression change and quickly offered a smile and explanation.</p><p>"There's nothing wrong. I'm just a businessman who cares about profits. As long as the boss is angry enough to let me make money, it's fine!"</p><p>"Alright, then you two wait here for a moment while I go up to talk to the boss!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded; this was a good opportunity to observe more closely.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>Suddenly, a large and muscular man came upstairs from the staircase and charged at Mao Yu.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei instinctively turned around and shielded Mao Yu behind him.</p><p>"Who are you two?

I'm just a businessman focused on profits. As long as the boss is angry enough to let me earn money, it's all good!"</p><p>"Alright then, you two wait here for a moment while I go up to talk to the boss."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded; this was a perfect opportunity to observe more closely.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>Suddenly, a large and muscular man descended from the staircase and lunged at Mao Yu.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei instinctively turned around, shielding Mao Yu behind him.</p><p>"Who are you two? Daring to record! Hand over your phones!"</p><p>The scarred-faced man, seeing Mao Yu behind Zhu Tianlei, said menacingly.</p><p>It turned out that Mao Yu had secretly taken his phone to record the production process in the workshop, only for this man to discover it.</p><p>"We are customers here to conduct an inspection. Recording is just so we can better understand your production processes. There's no need to be so nervous, right?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said coolly.</p><p>"Customers?

The phone is mine. What right do you have to demand that I give it to you? And this is how you treat your customers?"</p><p>Mao Yu peered out from behind Zhu Tianlei and shouted fiercely.</p><p>"You're not going to hand it over, are you? If not, don't blame us for being ruthless!"</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Máo Yǔ clutched her phone; these videos were all evidence and could not be handed over. Besides, she was not afraid of Zhū Tiānlěi since he was so capable.</p><p>"Surround him!"</p><p>As soon as the man spoke, the workers who had been standing beside the machine suddenly stopped their work. Each person swept a hand under the machine panel, pulling out a stick as thick as a child's arm and silently surrounding Zhū Tiānlěi and Máoyǔ in the middle.</p>

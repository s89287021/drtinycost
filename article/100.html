						<p>This morning, Zhu Tianlei spent every second in a state of forced amusement with Mao Yu's mocking smile and chilling gaze. It felt unbearable, but fortunately, after breakfast, Mao Yu suggested they visit the selected factory site, which brought Zhu Tianlei immense relief.</p><p>Fortunately, Mao Yu did not pursue this matter further. Upon arriving at Lianggangzi, Zhu Tianlei saw neatly arranged land, and Mao Yu was very satisfied.</p><p>"Let's start construction tomorrow!"</p><p>"Tomorrow? Isn't that too soon?"</p><p>"What do you want to wait for?"</p><p>Mao Yu's aloof demeanor returned, leaving Zhu Tianlei momentarily speechless. He felt it was indeed too soon; they were not ready yet!</p><p>"You don't need to worry about building the factory. I've already contacted the designers and construction company, and the material suppliers are confirmed. The only thing you need to do is think about what main drugs the pharmaceutical plant will produce once completed. A pharmaceutical factory, after all, its soul lies in the medications."</p><p>"I already have an idea."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei straightened up, understanding that a consultant like her was putting in so much effort and dedication. As an owner, if he didn't do his part, it would be unforgivable.</p><p>"It's not enough to just have ideas; we need specific and actionable plans that can be implemented, including the efficacy, names, packaging, market positioning, and brand positioning of the drugs. The construction of the factory should be completed within a month, and before then, I need to see the complete plan."</p><p>With these words, Mao Yu turned around, swaying her slender waist, and walked down Lianggangzi with grace and decisiveness.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was once again left behind in the scorching late-summer sun, feeling disoriented.</p><p>By the time Zhu Tianlei reacted and tried to catch up, Mao Yu had already reached her white cc car. Without saying a word to him, she drove away at high speed.</p><p>At the clinic.</p><p>"Lanlan, I ask you, did your stomach hurt when you came here?"</p><p>Ma Lanlan was tidying up the syringes and disposable medical supplies when she suddenly heard Zhu Tianlei ask this question, leaving her momentarily stunned and blushing.</p><p>"What are you asking for?"</p><p>"I'm just curious. Tell me, does it hurt?"</p><p>Ma Lanlan bit her lip; although she had almost reached that point with Zhu Tianlei, they were not yet officially together. She found it difficult to open up about such a private matter. However, seeing Zhu Tianlei's serious expression without any hint of mischief, Ma Lanlan calmed herself.</p><p>"It hurts, nine out of ten women feel pain. I heard some women are in so much pain that they can hardly walk."</p><p>"Is it that severe?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was surprised; he had never been with a woman before and thus lacked such knowledge.</p><p>"Yes, especially if you catch a chill or strain yourself before that, the pain is even worse. Sometimes I feel like I'm dying from the pain."</p><p>Hearing this made Zhu Tianlei feel somewhat heartbroken. Recalling Zhang Yuntao's pale face when she was in pain previously, he finally resolved his determination.</p><p>"Tianlei, why are you asking about this?"</p><p>Only then did Ma Lanlan realize what she had just said.</p><p>"Lanlan, I'm developing a medicine that will make you all never have to fear it again."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words sounded like a promise. If someone else had said it, Ma Lanlan might not have believed them, but coming from Zhu Tianlei, she was convinced without a doubt.</p><p>After asking Ma Lanlan, Zhu Tianlei wandered over to the village primary school. Unfortunately, Yang Xiaoxue had gone to the city for an educational conference a week ago and hadn't returned yet.</p><p>Before he realized it, Zhu Tianlei found himself standing in front of Zhang Yuntao's house.</p><p>There are many rumors about a widow's doorstep; Zhu Tianlei had never given much thought to Zhang Yuntao before, so he hadn't visited. Later, after developing feelings for her and fearing it might affect her reputation, he stayed away out of respect.</p><p>Ma Lanlan was tidying up the syringes and disposable medical supplies when she suddenly heard Zhu Tianlei ask this question, leaving her momentarily stunned and blushing.</p><p>"What are you asking about?"</p><p>"I just wanted to know. Tell me, does it hurt?"</p><p>Ma Lanlan bit her lip; although she had almost reached that point with Zhu Tianlei, they were not yet officially together.

Later, after developing feelings for her and fearing it might affect her reputation, he stayed away out of respect.</p><p>This was the first time someone truly stood at the door. Zhang Yuntao's family background was average; their house in the village was not considered good and was very narrow, with a wooden gate.</p><p>Although it was morning, the courtyard was quiet. Zhu Tianlei stood by the wall, listened carefully, but heard no sound. Could everyone be gone? "Little harlot, you go around seducing wild men. Why can't you do it for me?"</p><p>Suddenly, a deliberately lowered voice came from within the wall. "Father-in-law, let me go; I am your daughter-in-law." "Pah, little slut. How could you do it with other men but not with me? Stop pretending to be decent......" Zhu Tianlei's anger rose as he heard this. The veins on his hand bulged, and he kicked the gate open with a bang.</p><p>Below the wall was a shed. Zhu Tianlei swiftly entered the shed and saw Zhang Yuntao's father-in-law, Chen Fanglin, grabbing Zhang Yuntao by the chest, half of his body pressing down on hers. Zhang Yuntao's face was wet with tears, frantically struggling. "Go to hell, old harlot!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei kicked out, not even waiting for Chen Fanglin to speak; he sent Chen Fanglin flying. Still unsatisfied, Zhu Tianlei chased after him, raining punches and kicks until Zhang Yuntao lunged at him, hugging his waist. "Tianlei, stop! You might kill someone!" "Humph, this old bastard deserves it if he dies!" Although Zhu Tianlei was angry, a bit of reason remained. He did not care about Chen Fanglin's fate but knew that as Zhang Yuntao, the daughter-in-law, she would get into trouble. Therefore, he stopped. Chen Fanglin was already in his fifties; how could he withstand Zhu Tianlei's assault? This beating had taken half of his life.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stared at Zhang Yuntao with half-open eyes, unable to understand why Zhu had suddenly barged in. But he quickly found the answer; it seemed that his daughter-in-law had hooked up with this guy again, no wonder he wasn’t allowed to touch her.</p><p>"Old man, I know what you're thinking. Yes, Yuntao is now my woman. If you dare to touch a single finger of hers again, I'll send you down there to reunite with your son!"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao was stunned and froze in place. She hadn’t expected Zhu Tianlei to say such things. She was a widow; although the villagers often leered at her and stared at her two treasures all the time, she knew that they were only interested in her body. But Zhu Tianlei was different; he genuinely cared about her.</p><p>Tears welled up in her eyes immediately.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was furious and no longer paid attention to Chen Fanglin, pulling Zhang Yuntao’s hand and leading her out. Because he was angry, his pull on Zhang Yuntao's hand lost its aim, but Zhang Yuntao obediently allowed herself to be pulled without uttering a word.</p><p>The two of them walked all the way to the small cornfield behind Chen’s house before stopping.</p><p>"Yuntao, you shouldn’t stay at Chen’s place anymore. I’ll rent you a house in the village."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei suppressed his boiling anger and said calmly, unable to imagine what would have happened if he hadn’t rushed over on impulse today.</p><p>However, he couldn’t keep guarding Zhang Yuntao all the time, and that old Chen was a despicable lecher. He didn’t feel at ease knowing Zhang Yuntao lived under the same roof as him.</p>

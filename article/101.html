						<p>Tian Lei, I know you're worried about me, but as long as I am a daughter-in-law of the Chen family, I cannot leave. However, I promise you that I will absolutely not give him any more chances to hurt me.</p><p>Zhu Tian Lei knew that Zhang Yun Tao was speaking the truth; as long as he did not formally recognize her, Zhang Yun Tao would remain the daughter-in-law of the Chen family.</p><p>"Tian Lei, don't be angry anymore, you look so unattractive."</p><p>Zhang Yun Tao pouted at Zhu Tian Lei, looking incredibly cute.</p><p>Zhang Yun Tao was a very mature woman, and such an expression was rare. However, precisely because of this, it gave her a special charm, as if pricking the balloon with a needle, Zhu Tian Lei's anger slowly dissipated.</p><p>"Yun Tao, I'm really useless."</p><p>Zhu Tian Lei hugged Zhang Yun Tao and said in a low voice.</p><p>Zhang Yun Tao tiptoed to hug Zhu Tian Lei's neck, her warm lips gradually approaching his, finally touching each other.</p><p>Her somewhat clumsy rubbing on Zhu Tian Lei's lips made him feel hot all over, his heart tingling with desire. He decided to take the initiative, wrapping Zhang Yun Tao in his strong arms and using his agile tongue to probe into her mouth, their kiss fierce like soldiers reviewing troops on a battlefield.</p><p>Their breathing became increasingly rapid. Zhu Tian Lei hugged Zhang Yun Tao's heated body and slowly moved towards the nearby cornfield.</p><p>Like lightning stirring earthfire or dry wood catching fire, it was unstoppable.</p><p>Zhu Tian Lei's large hands moved up and down, her blouse falling off, revealing an enticing view.</p><p>Zhu Tian Lei grabbed one of the white rabbits with his hand, his tongue touching it, leaving wet marks. The other hand continued downward, wandering through the grasslands, where trickling streams flowed continuously.</p><p>Zhang Yun Tao's body was soft like water and finally collapsed in the cornfield.</p><p>With Zhu Tian Lei on top, sweat poured down, while Zhang Yun Tao's delicate hands wandered around, finally resting on a towering giant.</p><p>The scorching heat and hard-as-iron texture made Zhang Yun Tao's heart both nervous and eager.</p><p>She hesitated for a moment, then fully exposed the giant phallus to the air. Indeed, it was astonishing in size.</p><p>"How big?"</p><p>Looking down at the woman beneath him, with her seductive eyes, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"Annoying!"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao pouted angrily, yet she didn't pull back her gaze; instead, she bravely stretched out her hand.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei grinned wickedly and bent down to prepare to enter, but at the last moment, he suddenly stopped.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao had already prepared herself to welcome this man whom she loved deeply, but Zhu Tianlei's sudden stop made her face turn pale gradually.</p><p>"Tianlei, do you hate me?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was stunned.</p><p>He didn't hate her; he had psychological shadows and conditioned reflexes. Every time he was about to take action, someone would interrupt him, so he had become extremely cautious—once bitten by a snake, ten years afraid of ropes.</p><p>But seeing Zhang Yuntao's injured expression, Zhu Tianlei immediately felt heartache.</p><p>"Stupid woman, I can't wait to love you!"</p><p>With that, he leaned down and plunged in. The giant phallus entered the abyss, splashing water all around.</p><p>In the cornfield, the fragrance of soil mixed with the sweet scent of mature corn and raw hormones wafted through the air.</p><p>Leaves rustled and murmurs echoed.</p><p>She hesitated for a moment before fully exposing the colossal phallus to the air. Indeed, it was awe-inspiring in size.</p><p>"How big?"</p><p>Looking down at the woman beneath him with her alluring eyes, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"Annoying!"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao pouted angrily, yet she didn't avert her gaze; instead, she bravely extended her hand.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei grinned wickedly and bent down to prepare to enter, but at the last moment, he suddenly stopped.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao had already prepared herself for this man whom she loved deeply, but Zhu Tianlei's sudden stop made her face turn pale gradually.</p><p>"Tianlei, do you hate me?"</p><p>This was the only thought that came to Zhang Yuntao's mind. Otherwise, with Zhu Tianlei on the brink of explosion, what could have stopped him at such a critical moment?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was stunned.</p><p>He didn't hate her; he had psychological shadows and conditioned reflexes. Every time he was about to take action, someone would interrupt him, so he had become extremely cautious—once bitten by a snake, ten years afraid of ropes.</p><p>But seeing Zhang Yuntao's injured expression, Zhu Tianlei immediately felt heartache.</p><p>"Stupid woman, I can't wait to love you!"</p><p>With that, he leaned down and plunged in. The colossal phallus entered the abyss, splashing water all around.</p><p>In the cornfield, the fragrance of soil mixed with the sweet scent of mature corn and raw hormones wafted through the air.</p><p>Leaves rustled and murmurs echoed.</p><p>She paused for a moment before fully exposing the colossal phallus to the air. Indeed, it was astonishing in size.</p><p>"How big?"</p><p>Looking down at the woman beneath him with her alluring eyes, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"Annoying!"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao pouted angrily, yet she didn't avert her gaze; instead, she bravely extended her hand.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei grinned wickedly and bent down to prepare to enter, but at the last moment, he suddenly stopped.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao had already prepared herself for this man whom she loved deeply, but Zhu Tianlei's sudden stop made her face turn pale gradually.</p><p>"Tianlei, do you hate me?"</p><p>This was the only thought that came to Zhang Yuntao's mind.

The colossal phallus entered the abyss, splashing water all around.</p><p>In the cornfield, the fragrance of soil mingled with the sweet scent of mature corn and raw hormones, wafting through the air like a tantalizing blend.</p><p>Leaves rustled softly, and murmurs echoed faintly.</p><p>When the wind ceased and the rain subsided, Zhang Yuntao lay in Zhu Tianlei's arms, her eyes misty with tears streaming down like water from the corners. The red blush on her cheeks seemed more radiant than ever.</p><p>"Why are you crying?"</p><p>"It's nothing, Tianlei. I'm shedding happy tears! Really, I'm very happy!"</p><p>Nestled against Zhu Tianlei's bare chest and feeling the vigorous heartbeat within his ribcage, Zhang Yuntao felt that all the pain she had endured in her first half of life was worthwhile. At this moment, she seemed to have gained a second life, possessing the entire world.</p><p>"Stupid woman, I'm very happy too. I promise to keep you happy forever!"</p><p>This was Zhu Tianlei's commitment as a man.</p><p>It was also the vow made between lovers that became more vivid with the passage of time and never faded.</p><p>The two of them talked for a while longer before reluctantly parting ways. Zhu Tianlei repeatedly urged Zhang Yuntao to always carry her phone with her, assuring her that he would keep his phone on for twenty hours straight and rush over at the first sign of trouble.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao's heart was filled with sweetness as she blushed and nodded shyly.</p><p>Having made up his mind, after leaving the cornfield, Zhu Tianlei went to Xiaohei Stream again.</p><p>There were several vague prescriptions in his mind for treating female dysmenorrhea and gynecological diseases, but he needed to condense these into a single formula that was both potent and easy to consume.</p><p>The herb field was strange; it seemed like an ordinary area, yet the soil appeared unusually fertile. After a few days, the herbs had grown denser, and some species that usually took three or five years to mature were ready within half a month.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei picked several herbs from the field that were particularly effective for female gynecological conditions, such as Angelica sinensis for blood tonification and regulating menstruation, Ligusticum chuanxiong for promoting qi flow and treating blood disorders, Leonurus japonicus for diuresis and edema relief, Cynomorium songaricum, and more than ten other herbs, filling his arms.</p><p>Seeing that it was still early in the day, he decided to take a detour to the gourd cave. After meditating for an hour or so each time he visited the cave, he always felt reborn.</p><p>However, just as he approached the entrance, he heard voices coming from inside and stopped in his tracks, standing outside the cave.</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>A man's voice.</p><p>"Yes, that guy used to be nothing, just loafing around all day. But after he came out of this grotto, it was like he had changed into a different person. He can now treat illnesses and is incredibly agile."</p><p>Another man's voice, one I recognize somewhat.</p><p>"Alright, don't tell anyone about today's affair, especially don't let them know you've seen me. This is five thousand yuan; keep it safe. If anything happens in the future, I'll get in touch with you!"</p><p>"Hehe, no problem, no problem, I'll be at your service whenever you need me!"</p><p>Hearing footsteps inside, Zhu Tianlei swayed and hid behind a large boulder. Following that, he saw a grayish silhouette emerge from the cave, look around, and quickly dart into the small forest, disappearing.</p><p>A couple more minutes passed, and another figure walked out, a smug smile on his lips, strutting towards the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei slowly strolled out from behind the boulder, looking in the direction the person had left. He gave a cold laugh.</p><p>If you want people not to know, don't do it yourself.</p>

						<p>The wind whistled at his ear.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's feet moved as lightly as a duckweed, and the group of people formed a human wall that seemed to collapse like a row of dominoes.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was as light as a swallow. Stepping on others' bodies, he instantly stood in the middle of the crowd. Behind him loomed a hidden door.</p><p>Qin Zhuang's face turned deathly pale.</p><p>The gauze on his body seeped with traces of blood.</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>He, Qin Zhuang, had been mixing it up in the world since he was ten, following Ge Tianying. He had seen countless ruthless people—'Ghostface Qinming,' who swept through seven sects and eight gangs in Yunhai City, making both the underworld and the law tremble, had only made him feel indifferent.</p><p>But the Zhu Tianlei standing before him now filled him with an inner fear.</p><p>Was it because he was getting older, and his courage had waned?</p><p>"Qin Zhuang, I'll give you one last chance. Hand over Zheng Xiuxiu's ex-husband."</p><p>Qin Zhuang's wound ripped open, and fresh blood seeped out, soon staining the white gauze on his chest red.</p><p>Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, he suddenly laughed.</p><p>"Ha ha ha, Zhu Tianlei, are you still believing this woman's lies? She doesn't have an ex-husband; that was her pimp. Did you see my wounds? They're all because of that little bitch. That pimp of hers is a traitor. In the Black Eagle Society, traitors never end well......."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's eyes flickered, but his expression remained unchanged.</p><p>"That's your Black Eagle Society's business. I don't care about it; I just want the man."</p><p>"You want the man, do you? Fine, Haozi, go and fetch him for me."</p><p>Haozi, who had been named by Qin Zhuang and was pretending to be dead on the ground, reluctantly got up from his fake death state when he heard his boss speak and unwillingly left the room. </p><p>Five or six minutes later, a blood-soaked person was carried in. </p><p>"Big brother....." </p><p>Upon seeing the carried-in individual, Zheng Xiuxiu immediately became agitated, almost crawling over to him. Before she could get close, Haozi slapped her across the face. </p><p>"Foul woman, scram!" </p><p>Zheng Xiuxiu was thrown to the ground by the slap but did not give up; she crawled back up and tried to pounce again. Just as Haozi raised his hand to slap her once more, a blood-stained hand from the stretcher grabbed Haozi's wrist. </p><p>"Do not hit her......" </p><p>The voice was weak but carried an unwavering determination. </p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned. </p><p>Him? </p><p>"Lu Kang, do you think you're the second-in-command of the Black Eagle Society? Let go!" </p><p>Lying on the stretcher, blood-soaked, was none other than Lu Kang, who had a few encounters with Zhu Tianlei, each more unexpected than the last. </p><p>Seeing Haozi's impatient expression and his intention to hit Lu Kang with his other hand, two voices sounded simultaneously. </p><p>"Stop!" </p><p>"Don't!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shouted for everyone to stop, while Zheng Xiuxiu shouted not to.</p><p>But Haozi's hand had already fallen.</p><p>Zheng Xiuxiu closed her eyes in despair, but Qin Zhuang's eyes flashed with cruelty and satisfaction.</p><p>For betraying him, Qin Zhuang, the prostitute should pay a price!</p><p>But in the next second, screams echoed.</p><p>Qin Zhuang's eyes widened, and Zheng Xiuxiu stopped sobbing.</p><p>They saw that Haozi, who had been full of momentum, was clutching his shoulder, mouth agape, wailing continuously.</p><p>"Qin Zhuang, you hate betrayal, yet you are yourself a traitor. Lu Kang at least knows to protect his woman; what about you? You repay kindness with enmity towards your benefactor. If one were to speak truthfully, shouldn't you be consigned to the eighteen layers of hell?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not say much, but each word he spoke was like a needle pricking directly at the heart.</p><p>What Qin Zhuang hated most was being called a traitor.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you are courting death!"</p><p>This sentence seemed to be the last straw that broke the camel's back—more precisely, it toppled the last straw supporting Qin Zhuang's reason.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not expect this sentence to have such an impact on Qin Zhuang and thus was unprepared.</p><p>Qin Zhuang acted like a frenzied wild wolf, suddenly breaking free from Zhu Tianlei's grasp, then drawing out a two-foot-long machete from his waistband.</p><p>He slashed towards Zhu Tianlei's neck.</p><p>Zheng Xiuxiu's blood froze instantly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shouted for everyone to stop, while Zheng Xiuxiu shouted not to.</p><p>But Haozi’s hand had already fallen.</p><p>Zheng Xiuxiu closed her eyes in despair, while Qin Zhuang’s eyes flashed with cruelty and satisfaction.</p><p>For betraying him, the prostitute Qin Zhuang deserved a price!</p><p>But in the next second, screams echoed.</p><p>Qin Zhuang’s eyes widened, and Zheng Xiuxiu stopped sobbing.</p><p>They saw that Haozi, who had been full of momentum, was clutching his shoulder, mouth agape, wailing continuously.</p><p>"Qin Zhuang, you hate betrayal, yet you are yourself a traitor. Lu Kang at least knows to protect his woman; what about you? You repay kindness with enmity towards your benefactor. If one were to speak truthfully, shouldn’t you be consigned to the eighteen layers of hell?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not say much, but each word he spoke was like a needle pricking directly at the heart.</p><p>What Qin Zhuang hated most was being called a traitor.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you are courting death!"</p><p>This sentence seemed to be the last straw that broke the camel's back—more precisely, it toppled the last straw supporting Qin Zhuang’s reason.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not expect this sentence to have such an impact on Qin Zhuang and thus was unprepared.</p><p>Qin Zhuang acted like a frenzied wild wolf, suddenly breaking free from Zhu Tianlei’s grasp, then drawing out a two-foot-long machete from his waistband.</p><p>He slashed towards Zhu Tianlei’s neck.</p><p>Zheng Xiuxiu's blood froze instantly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shouted for everyone to stop, while Zheng Xiuxiu cried out not to.</p><p>But Haozi's hand had already fallen.</p><p>With despair, Zheng Xiuxiu closed her eyes, yet Qin Zhuang's gaze flickered with cold cruelty and grim satisfaction.</p><p>For betraying him, the prostitute Qin Zhuang would pay a steep price!</p><p>In the next instant, screams pierced through the air.</p><p>Qin Zhuang’s eyes widened in shock, and Zheng Xiuxiu ceased her weeping.</p><p>They watched as Haozi, who had been charging forward with fierce determination, now clutched his shoulder, mouth agape in agony, wailing pitifully.</p><p>"Qin Zhuang, you despise betrayal, yet you are a traitor yourself. Lu Kang at least knows to shield his woman; what of you? You repay kindness with malice toward your benefactor. If truth were told, shouldn't you be consigned to the eighteen layers of hell?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke little, but each word was like a needle pricking directly at the heart.</p><p>What Qin Zhuang hated most was being labeled a traitor.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you seek death!"</p><p>This remark seemed to be the final straw that broke the camel's back—more precisely, it shattered the last pillar of reason in Qin Zhuang’s mind.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had not anticipated this sentence would have such an impact on Qin Zhuang and thus was unprepared.</p><p>Qin Zhuang lunged like a frenzied wild wolf, breaking free from Zhu Tianlei’s grasp, then swiftly drew out a two-foot-long machete from his waistband.</p><p>He swung it toward Zhu Tianlei's neck.</p><p>Zheng Xiuxiu’s blood froze instantly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei is going to die!</p><p>The oily man drew a cold breath, Rui Tianlei's arrogance was so shocking that his life would end this way?</p><p>Long hair parted, mouth agape, eyes wide open, waiting for the saber to fall on Zhu Tianlei. He needed the other's blood to wash away the humiliation he had suffered.</p><p>......</p><p>The saber sliced into flesh.</p><p>Blood splattered.</p><p>Blood flowers danced like butterflies.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei!"</p><p>Zheng Xiuxiu's cry was heart-wrenching.</p><p>More sorrowful than when she saw her daughter fall heavily from a height.</p><p>She had killed Zhu Tianlei, the one who saved herself and her daughter, who risked his life for her alone.</p><p>"Qin Zhuang, this is what you get!"</p><p>However, Zheng Xiuxiu only looked up sharply when Zhu Tianlei's voice echoed.</p><p>Qin Zhuang clutched his shoulder, half of his arm sliced by the saber, revealing pale bones and flesh.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei ignored Qin Zhuang and strode toward Lu Kang.</p><p>Haozi stood rooted to the spot like a log, eyes wide, unfocused, emotionless.</p><p>"Lu Kang, we really have a connection!"</p><p>Lu Kang, lying on the stretcher, looked at Zhu Tianlei's enlarged face in front of him and couldn't quite describe his feelings.</p><p>However, he was secretly relieved that he hadn't taken things to extremes; otherwise, he might not have had the chance to see tomorrow's sun.</p><p>"Yes, we really do have a connection..."</p><p>Lu Kang felt somewhat embarrassed; there was a hint of self-mockery in his words.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at Lu Kang, whose body was covered with numerous wounds. These people were ruthless, but fortunately, there were no fatal injuries.</p><p>"Can you walk?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei asked.</p><p>This definitely wasn't a place to treat injuries.</p><p>"As long as I'm not dead, I can walk!"</p><p>Whatever the case, Lu Kang's unyielding spirit made Zhu Tianlei admire him.</p><p>"You come over and help him up; let's go!"</p><p>Zheng Xiuxiu felt like she was dreaming. Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, she snapped out of it and instantly rushed forward, trembling hands helping to lift Lu Kang off the stretcher.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei helped Zheng Xiuxiu to support Lu Kang. Indeed, Lu Kang was a real man; despite his numerous wounds, he stood up without even a groan.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took a step forward.</p><p>However, what no one expected was that Qin Zhuang, who had already lost an arm, charged at them again. This time, his target was not Zhu Tianlei but Zheng Xiuxiu.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>"Hmph, stinking bitch, thinking of running away? Once you get on my bed, you'll never escape. Don't you remember how that little brat died?"</p><p>Lu Kang stumbled due to the loss of support and almost fell.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was quick to grab Lu Kang's arm to steady him.</p><p>Seeing his woman fall into Qin Zhuang's hands and hearing what Qin Zhuang said made Lu Kang so angry that his body trembled.</p>

						<p>Zhu Tianlei scratched his head, looking rather foolish. Hao Xinmei's heart, which was about to burst out of her throat with anxiety, inexplicably fell.</p><p>"What is your phone number?"</p><p>Hao Xinmei looked at Zhu Tianlei, secretly guessing that he might want to inform his family. After all, given the current situation, it would be impossible for him to escape no matter what she did; even if she tried to rescue him with all her might, it wouldn't be a quick success. It was understandable for Zhu Tianlei to want to reassure his family.</p><p>"This is the number!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took out the small card from his pocket, and Hao Xinmei dialed the phone number on the card.</p><p>On Sun Jianguo's end, Director Zhang had already made the call earlier, so when he saw Zhu Tianlei's actions, there was a hint of disdain and coldness in Sun Jianguo's eyes. This disdain came naturally to someone in a superior position, ingrained in his very bones.</p><p>"Director Zhang's status in Yunhai City cannot be shaken. Even if you bring all your uncles and aunts here, it would not make a difference."</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo spoke with sarcasm, but Zhu Tianlei remained unperturbed. He took the phone Hao Xinmei handed over and listened to the clear ringtone, his expression calm.</p><p>"Mr. Ma, I have some trouble here. I don't know... Little Mei, what is the name of this restaurant?"</p><p>"Liyuan Chun."</p><p>To Hao Xinmei's surprise, Zhu Tianlei asked such a question. It seemed that he was not trying to inform his family but rather... seeking help.</p><p>But in Yunhai City, who could move the Sun family or Director Zhang?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, living deep in the mountains and unable even to use a mobile phone, had no one to turn to for help.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled faintly and hung up the call. Then he pulled Hao Xinmei and sat down on the chair.</p><p>"It's Director Zhang, right? I, Zhu Tianlei, have never seen such an important official as the director of the public security bureau in my whole life. Today has been quite an eye-opener. Little Mei, let's wait here; standing for too long can cause varicose veins in your legs!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Hao Xinmei with a smirking face and said, laughing.</p><p>Sun JianGuo glared at Zhu Tianlei viciously. Having lived for most of his life and indulged in political machinations for decades, he had long cultivated a face that never showed his emotions. However, now, his patience and composure were on the brink of collapse.</p><p>The reason he hadn't ordered anyone to take action directly was twofold: first, the situation at the scene proved that the opposing party was overwhelmingly powerful; taking action would be futile. Second, he had always been skilled in leveraging others' strength against them and did not want to act directly to avoid giving his adversaries an excuse.</p><p>In fact, he hadn't even thought about calling Zhang Gu before, but it was clear that Qiu Ran could not resolve the current predicament.</p><p>"Young man, remember to leave yourself some room when doing things. Don't close off all your exits; such people do not live long!"</p><p>"Really? Thank you for your wise advice, Mr. Sun. However, such words of wisdom are better suited for your precious son, who needs them more than I do!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei refused to give ground either in his actions or in his words. Whatever Sun JianGuo said was thrown right back at him, making his face even uglier.</p><p>"Mr. Sun, Director Zhang is coming with people!"</p><p>Zhang Ye had been waiting at the entrance. Seeing Director Zhang's car pull up, he returned to report to Sun JianGuo.</p><p>"Very well. I want to see how long you can continue being arrogant. I'll teach your parents a good lesson and make you understand what it means to be a person!"</p><p>Sun JianGuo looked at Zhu Tianlei; these words were an outright threat.</p><p>"I don't need Mr. Sun's trouble. My parents have educated me well; at least they taught me that I am a human being who should do human things, not just exist as one and do what beasts would do!"</p><p>"Humph!"</p><p>Sun JianGuo did not want to waste his words on Zhu Tianlei further. As Director Zhang walked in, Sun JianGuo approached him, whispering something into Zhang Gu's ear. Zhang Gu then fixed his gaze on Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"There are people causing trouble here; the social impact is extremely bad. Control this person and prevent the suspect from hurting others again, to avoid further casualties."</p><p>Zhang Gu waved his hand, and a group of men in camouflage surged into the hotel, each carrying weapons, some even with riot shields. Those who knew that their target was just an unarmed man were bewildered, while those who didn't know thought they were dealing with a small armed force.</p><p>Little Liyuan Chun had long become a place of dispute; it was surrounded inside and out, and everyone watched intently as Zhu Tianlei, sitting in the private room, fiddled excitedly with his phone.</p><p>"Get moving!"</p><p>Zhang Gu gave an order, and those in camouflage uniforms quickly approached Zhu Tianlei with their weapons. Zhu Tianlei seemed oblivious as his smartphone buzzed with music. It was his first time playing LOL, and he felt an unusual thrill.</p><p>But just as the first person in camouflage extended his taser, Zhu Tianlei, who had been looking down at his phone screen, suddenly raised his head, smiled slightly at the other person, and then the taser traced a perfect parabolic arc through the air.</p><p>It soared over the crowd and landed with a whizz on Sun Jianguo's foot.</p><p>"Arrogant, too arrogant!"</p><p>Sun Jianguo felt suffocating pain in his chest as if a clot was stuck at the back of his throat, neither going up nor down.</p><p>"What are you looking at? Move now!"</p><p>Zhang Gu also looked displeased. He had participated in many arrests but none had ever made him feel nervous like this young man did. Despite being dressed normally with no hint of murderous intent, he gave Zhang Gu an eerie feeling.</p><p>"Stop!"</p><p>As the camouflage-clad individuals were about to charge forward again, a man's voice suddenly came from outside, powerful and intimidating.</p><p>"Secretary Yang? Mayor Wu?"</p><p>Zhang Gu turned around, rubbing his eyes in disbelief. Sun Jianguo's face instantly paled, and Hao Xinmei looked at Zhu Tianlei with curiosity.</p><p>How could these two people be here out of nowhere in Liyuan Chunlai? Could it be related to the phone call Zhu Tianlei made earlier?</p><p>But how was that possible?</p><p>"Director Zhang, what are you doing?"</p><p>Wu Pingjian glanced at Zhang Gu, feeling a surge of anger. None of these people ever gave him peace of mind. He had just settled Old Ma and hadn't even had time to sit down when Old Ma and Secretary Yang called him here.</p><p>"Mayor Wu, I received a report of a vicious assault incident here, so I brought the police force to handle it!"</p><p>Wu Pingjian glanced around and did not see anyone injured. His face was somewhat unpleasant, as Secretary Yang was still by his side. Both governance and law were under his purview, yet Zhang Gu seemed determined to play tricks on him.</p><p>"A vicious assault incident? Where are the victim and suspect?"</p><p>"The victim is over there, and the suspect is right here!"</p><p>Zhang Gu first pointed at Sun Jiang, who had already been carried away on a stretcher, then he pointed at Zhu Tianlei, who looked innocent.</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo seized every opportunity to pin the blame on Zhu Tianlei, seeing him as a thorn in his side. He would not rest until he removed it.</p><p>"Hey kid, we meet again. Tell me what happened?"</p>

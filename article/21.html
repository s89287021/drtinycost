						<p>A shirtless man spoke first, and everyone else joined in one after another, taking turns to speak. Of course, the majority were on Zhu Tianlei's side.</p><p>When the driver and his wife saw that the people in the car had turned against them, they knew continuing would anger the crowd. The conductor reacted quickly, grabbing his husband who was about to take action.</p><p>"Humph, I, Li Dongkui, am putting it out there: if this kid can revive him, fine; but if he fails, I'll send this brat to the police station as a murderer!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained silent.</p><p>Time ticked by, and the old man still showed no sign of coming around. Yang Xiaoxue was growing increasingly anxious, beads of sweat breaking out on her forehead. She regretted urging Zhu Tianlei to accompany her into town.</p><p>If this old man died, Zhu Tianlei would have a hard time explaining himself!</p><p>The other passengers had various expressions, reflecting on how they had spoken up for Zhu Tianlei, angering Li Dongkui, and wondering if they would be implicated if the old man died.</p><p>Li Dongkui stared intently at Zhu Tianlei's every move. As soon as the old man breathed his last, he intended to tie him up and take him to the police station, condemning him to a life in prison.</p><p>"He's dead!"</p><p>Suddenly, the old man who had started to look a bit better shuddered, then slumped to one side of his seat.</p><p>This triggered another uproar. Those who had previously spoken up for Zhu Tianlei changed their tune again, accusing him of overestimating himself. Li Dongkui smiled sinisterly and moved toward Zhu Tianlei once more.</p><p>"Tianlei!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue could no longer hold back and screamed in alarm. If the old man died, she would accompany Zhu Tianlei to turn themselves in.</p><p>At that moment, a decision was made deep within her heart.</p><p>"Boy, you reap what you sow. What have you got to say now?"</p><p>Li Dongkui formed scissors with his hands, aiming for Zhu Tianlei's neck this time. As his hand was about to make contact, Zhu Tianlei suddenly stood up and, in an instant, flipped his hands, grabbing Li Dongkui's wrists.</p><p>"Do you know, if you had just touched him earlier, his life would have been forfeit. When it comes to the phrase 'kill and die,' you two are more fitting than I am!"</p><p>Li Dongkui was taller than Zhu Tianlei by a full fist, and his robust build was much stronger compared to Zhu's. However, for some reason, at this moment, no matter how he struggled, his wrist was firmly gripped by Zhu Tianlei, leaving him unable to move.</p><p>"Pfft, everyone in the car saw it; this old man was clearly killed by you. You are a murderer! Moreover, not a single person I've sent to the police station has returned safely!"</p><p>Before Li Dongkui took over this transportation route, he had been the chauffeur for the mayor of Dahesi County. Though he was just a driver, he was highly regarded; many confidential and secret matters were handled by Li Dongkui. Therefore, his confidence wasn't an act.</p><p>"Oh? Such big talk!"</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>A sudden voice echoed, making Li Dongkui's face stiffen. He turned to see that the old man, who had already died, suddenly stood up for no reason.</p><p>"Young man, thank you! If not for you today, I would have met my maker!"</p><p>The people in the car were stunned when they saw the old man awaken, their mouths agape like they had swallowed hot eggs.</p><p>"Master, don't be polite; we just happened to meet. After all, it seems our destinies are intertwined!"</p><p>Seeing the old man awaken, Zhu Tianlei also relaxed.</p><p>"Li Dongkui, since the man is awake now, do you have anything else to say?"</p><p>Li Dongkui glanced at Zhu Tianlei and then at the old man behind him, his face turning pale and red alternately. He couldn't swallow this insult; Li Dongkui was somewhat respected in the surrounding area, and if news of today's events spread, where would he put his face?</p><p>"Humph, only now do I realize you're working with this old man. The two of you are colluding to frame someone, but you've chosen the wrong target. My ceramic isn't so easily broken, Li Dongkui! Yin Ling, call Chief Zhao and tell him there's a disturbance on our vehicle; ask him to send people over!"</p><p>Li Dongkui instructed his wife, originally not wanting to use Chief Zhao as leverage. However, in this moment, he just wanted to vent his anger and didn't care about other considerations.</p><p>"I'll call right away!"</p><p>Yin Ling heard her husband's words and immediately took out her phone.</p><p>"Never mind, Director Zhao Zhigui is on his way!"</p><p>The old man looked grim and waved at Li Dongkui. Hearing the old man directly call out Director Zhao's name, Li Dongkui's face could not help but turn pale.</p><p>Could this old man have some background?</p><p>But after taking a good look, Li Dongkui dismissed the initial panic. The old man was dressed plainly, from head to toe like a farmer, and even took the bus when going out; there was no way he had any background. It was most likely just bluffing.</p><p>"Hmph, old fellow, you have quite an attitude! Do you know what relationship I have with Director Zhao? I shielded him from a knife, we are comrades-in-arms, so you two are as good as dead today!"</p><p>Li Dongkui spoke viciously, but the old man did not show any sign of panic. Instead, he shook his head and laughed. Looking at Zhu Tianlei, who also had an indifferent expression, Li Dongkui seemed more like a self-proclaimed clown.</p><p>"Well then, you two really are stubborn to the bitter end..."</p><p>"Old Li, they're here!"</p><p>Yin Ling suddenly pointed out the window and shouted.</p><p>The passengers in the car were all stirred up. They felt that everything that happened on the car was just like watching a movie, even more exciting and bustling than any film. Hearing Yin Ling's words, everyone turned their heads to look outside.</p><p>"You two are as good as dead!"</p><p>Li Dongkui sneered and got out of the car in three quick strides. At this moment, a military green jeep roaring down the mountain road screeched to a halt.</p><p>Three men in police uniforms got off the car one after another. The leader had a square face and straight eyebrows, around forty years old. As soon as he stood still, Li Dongkui rushed over.</p><p>"Kid, I've caused you trouble!"</p><p>The old man seemed oblivious to everything happening outside the car and smiled at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Old man, there's no need to be polite anymore. As long as you're fine, everything else is none of my concern! I, Zhu Tianlei, have never been afraid of any trouble!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's voice wasn't loud, but it made people feel incredibly relieved upon hearing it.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue gripped her phone tightly, with the screen displaying a string of digits. The name associated with that number was clearly 'Dad'. Yang Xiaoxue had already decided that if all else failed, she would call Yang Dong.</p><p>Although Yang Dong worked at the Education Bureau, he still knew quite a few people. In any case, she couldn't just sit idly by and watch Zhu Tianlei get into trouble.</p><p>Before the conversation even concluded, Li Dongkui returned, followed by the three individuals who had exited from the jeep earlier.</p>

						<p>Chiao Chen had not finished speaking when Zhu Tianlei vanished before his eyes like a gust of wind.</p><p>Suddenly, Chiao Chen realized that he might have caused trouble. What should he do?</p><p>After Zhu Tianlei left Meixin Pharmaceutical Company, the jeep sped towards the city hospital.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, I found the patient you asked me to check on; they are in room 507 on the fifth floor of the outpatient building."</p><p>As soon as Zhu Tianlei entered the city hospital, Li Ping was already standing at the entrance. To Li Ping, Zhu Tianlei had become an idol in his heart.</p><p>Therefore, when he received Zhu Tianlei's call, Li Ping not only felt no displeasure but also a bit of excitement, as if he was getting closer to his idol.</p><p>"Also, the medical records show that this person indeed developed acute myocarditis due to overwork."</p><p>After receiving Zhu Tianlei's call, Li Ping retrieved all of Chen Guangming's medical records. Therefore, the information provided to Zhu Tianlei was extremely detailed and accurate.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei slightly frowned.</p><p>Acute myocarditis caused by overwork?</p><p>This was unexpected for Zhu Tianlei. It seemed that things were not as he had thought, just a simple labor dispute between employees and the company?</p><p>"Director Li, I want to go check on the patient."</p><p>"Sure sure, I'll go with you."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei wanted to say something, but seeing Li Ping's sincere and eager expression, the words died in his throat.</p><p>Guided by Li Ping, the two quickly reached the fifth floor of the outpatient building.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, turn the corner!"</p><p>After the two people went up the stairs, someone rushed over in the hallway. Nobody knew why they were in such a hurry; they almost bumped into Li Ping.</p><p>"People these days are always rushing!" </p><p>Li Ping dodged aside and couldn't help but complain. Zhu Tianlei watched as the person's quick figure disappeared down the stairs and frowned.</p><p>"How is the patient's condition?"</p><p>In the ward, the on-duty doctor had just finished an examination when he ran into Li Ping and Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"The recovery is going well. He just woke up and ate some congee. If things continue this way, he should be cured within a week."</p><p>The on-duty doctor seemed satisfied with Chen Guangming's progress and kept glancing at him.</p><p>"Did someone visit?"</p><p>The on-duty doctor looked at Zhu Tianlei, unsure of his identity, and didn't know whether to answer until Li Ping nodded.</p><p>"Somebody came to visit, but the person was here before I arrived."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said no more and stepped toward Chen Guangming's bed. He extended his hand to take Chen Guangming's pulse. This time, Zhu Tianlei spent a long time on it.</p><p>Indeed, the hospital's diagnosis record was correct!</p><p>After the two individuals ascended the stairs, someone rushed down the hallway with haste, nearly colliding into Li Ping. It was unclear why they were in such a hurry.</p><p>"People these days are always in such a rush!" </p><p>Li Ping sidestepped and couldn't help but mutter to himself. Zhu Tianlei watched as the person quickly disappeared down the stairs and frowned.</p><p>"How is the patient's condition?"</p><p>The on-duty doctor had just finished an examination when he encountered Li Ping and Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"The recovery is going well. He just woke up and ate some congee. If things continue this way, he should be cured within a week."</p><p>The on-duty doctor seemed satisfied with Chen Guangming's progress and kept glancing at him.</p><p>"Did someone visit?"</p><p>The on-duty doctor looked at Zhu Tianlei, unsure of his identity, and hesitated before Li Ping nodded in affirmation.</p><p>"Somebody came to visit, but they were here before I arrived."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained silent and headed straight for Chen Guangming's bed. He extended his hand to take Chen Guangming's pulse, spending a considerable amount of time on it.</p><p>Indeed, the hospital's diagnosis record was accurate!</p><p>After the two individuals climbed the stairs, someone rushed down the hallway, nearly colliding with Li Ping. It was unclear why they were in such a hurry.</p><p>"People these days are always so rushed!" </p><p>Li Ping sidestepped and couldn't help but grumble to himself. Zhu Tianlei watched as the person quickly disappeared down the stairs and frowned.</p><p>"How is the patient's condition?"</p><p>The on-duty doctor had just finished an examination when he encountered Li Ping and Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"The recovery is progressing well. He recently woke up and had some congee. If this continues, he should be fully recovered within a week."</p><p>The on-duty doctor seemed satisfied with Chen Guangming's progress and kept glancing at him.</p><p>"Did someone visit?"</p><p>The on-duty doctor looked at Zhu Tianlei, unsure of his identity, and hesitated before Li Ping nodded in affirmation.</p><p>"Somebody came to visit, but they were here before I arrived."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained silent and walked directly to Chen Guangming's bed. He extended his hand to take Chen Guangming's pulse, spending a considerable amount of time on it.</p><p>Indeed, the hospital's diagnosis record was accurate!</p><p>What was going on? Zhu Tianlei’s heart lost all sense of calculation at this moment, no, that person who just came must be up to something. "Oh right, Doctor Zhu, I remember something. When the patient first entered the hospital, someone from a place called the 'Occupational Disease Diagnosis Center' came and examined the patient, also making a copy of the examination report." "You mean when they first entered?" "Yes, although this Occupational Disease Diagnosis Center is not part of the national administrative department, it is recognized by the Labor Bureau. Moreover, the family strongly requested it, and our hospital has no right to refuse." Li Ping explained. Zhu Tianlei looked at Chen Guangming, his mind racing. This definitely couldn’t be that simple; everything was too coincidental, and those relatives’ moves were absolutely not what an ordinary patient’s family could do. They clearly knew that relying solely on legal channels would not yield such a large sum of compensation, and they also knew what a company feared the most. They even had a good understanding of Hao Xinmei. How could this be coincidence? But if it wasn’t a coincidence, who was pulling the strings behind the scenes then? A competitor of Mind Heart Pharmaceutical? Or an enemy of Hao Xinmei? Competitor... Enemy... Zhu Tianlei silently repeated these two words countless times in his heart and suddenly had an epiphany. "Director Li, Director Li, there’s a patient brought to the emergency room; the situation is quite complex. Please go take a look!" Just as Zhu Tianlei was about to ask Li Ping and Chen Guangming more specific details, a young doctor suddenly ran in from outside with urgent tones.</p><p>"Alright, I'll be right there, Doctor Zhu, I......"</p><p>"I'll go with Director Li as well to see if we can offer any help."</p><p>Li Ping didn't expect Zhu Tianlei to say that. To be honest, he was delighted about it. In his view, Zhu Tianlei's skills were at a level where he could vie with the Grim Reaper for lives; if Zhu Tianlei agreed to go, there was no doubt the patient would survive.</p><p>Li Ping, Zhu Tianlei, and the young doctor sprinted together to the emergency room.</p><p>There were around four or five people gathered in the emergency room.</p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>As soon as Li Ping entered the emergency room, he asked his question.</p><p>"The patient suffered a sudden cerebral hemorrhage due to overwork. The CT scan of the brain showed massive bleeding in the ventricles with high-density casting, and there is an occupying effect around the hematoma. We have taken emergency measures, but the situation is not good....."</p><p>Upon hearing the words "overwork," Zhu Tianlei's nerves immediately tensed up.</p><p>"Please save him! He's only thirty-three years old, he has elderly parents and children at home; if anything happens to him, his whole family will be ruined!"</p><p>A middle-aged woman spoke up, seemingly a colleague or friend of the patient in bed.</p><p>"Don't worry, we'll do our best!"</p><p>Li Ping replied reassuringly and took the examination report from the attending doctor. After a quick look, he wanted to hand it over to Zhu Tianlei, but Zhu Tianlei shook his head to decline.</p><p>He walked beside the patient and placed his hand on the patient's wrist. Although the pulse was not good, it wasn't immediately life-threatening. However, it was clear that the hospital's treatments were ineffective as the bleeding in the patient's brain continued unabated.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei reached into his bag of needles, ready to inject, when he suddenly heard someone speak from nearby.</p><p>"This is our company's nth case now; if Mr. Sun doesn't step in, I think Edong Pharmaceutical will be ruined sooner or later......"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's hand hung in mid-air as he glanced at the speaker.</p><p>"Are you from Sun Family Pharmaceuticals?"</p>

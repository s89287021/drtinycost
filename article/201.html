						<p>"Zhu Tianlei, are you going to kill me?"</p><p>Yang Zhongmin hoped that Zhu Tianlei would escalate the matter to an irreparable extent, but when he saw Zhu Tianlei's bloodshot eyes, he suddenly felt afraid.</p><p>"I'm afraid dirtying my hands by killing you."</p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Yang Zhongmin was flipped over again, this time directly landing on the center table in the room. The artificial three-layer particleboard table creaked and snapped into two pieces.</p><p>The sharp edge of the broken wood mercilessly stabbed into Yang Zhongmin's fatty buttocks, causing him to howl in pain.</p><p>"Yang Zhongmin, we have no deep-seated enmity. Xu Mingzhe got what he deserved for his inhumane actions. I've given you multiple chances, but not only have you failed to restrain yourself, you've even escalated your actions, going so far as to use an innocent child's life to frame me. You're worse than an animal."</p><p>Finished speaking, Zhu Tianlei lifted his foot and stepped on Yang Zhongmin's pelvic bone. With his buttocks already in agony, being stepped on by Zhu Tianlei made Yang Zhongmin feel like half of his life had been crushed.</p><p>"Who are you? Stop it immediately!"</p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang out from the doorway. Zhu Tianlei slowly turned around to see a man with slightly gray temples standing at the door. He wasn't very tall and was dressed simply.</p><p>"County Secretary Deng, please save me! He's going to kill me......"</p><p>Seeing Deng Chang, Yang Zhongmin immediately felt a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Although he and Deng Chang could be considered political rivals and their relationship was far from good—merely cordial on the surface—the sudden appearance of Deng Chang seemed like a blessing in disguise, making Yang Zhongmin so excited that he almost jumped up in joy.</p><p>"County Secretary Deng?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's foot was still pressing down on Yang Zhongmin's body as he turned his head to look at Deng Chang.</p><p>"Yes, I am Deng Chang, the Party Secretary and County Mayor of Daheshan County. Who are you to dare cause trouble at the county government?"</p><p>Deng Chang had just returned from a meeting outside when he saw a crowd gathered far outside Yang Zhongmin's office but no one daring to approach. He came over personally only to witness this scene.</p><p>He is fifty years old, with thirty years of political experience. He has held the position of county magistrate for six years. Visits and incidents caused by the public are not uncommon, but those who dared to rush into the county magistrate's office, step on the county magistrate, and beat him up were rare. Zhu Tianlei was the first.</p><p>"County Magistrate Deng, I know you are a good leader. During your tenure in Dahe County, your political achievements were quite impressive. I don't want to put you in a difficult position, but..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei paused after finishing his sentence and then looked back at Yang Zhongmin.</p><p>"But it would be best if you didn't get involved in this matter. Yang Zhongmin owes me my life, and I want it back!"</p><p>Having said that, Zhu Tianlei raised his hand again, and Yang Zhongmin, a man weighing over two hundred pounds and a deputy county magistrate, actually opened his mouth and cried out.</p><p>"Hold on there, young man. From what you've been saying, you don't seem to be someone who is unreasonable. Speak your mind properly; this place is the county government, not a market. Moreover, Zhongmin is still the leader of the county. Your actions will only bring trouble upon yourself."</p><p>Deng Chang glanced at Zhu Tianlei and felt that he seemed familiar, though he could not quite recall why. As Zhu Tianlei said, he did not seem like someone who could not distinguish right from wrong, and he also did not wish for the other party to make an irreparable mistake.</p><p>"Trouble? What I hate is that because of the word 'trouble,' I repeatedly let him off the hook in the past. Otherwise, that child would not have died senselessly and become a scapegoat for me!"</p><p>Deng Chang's expression changed.</p><p>"You are Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>No wonder he felt familiar with him. Last time when Tianlei opened his pharmacy, Deng had gone to the opening ceremony with Yang Wenjie and Wu Mingjian. Furthermore, Mayor Yang Wenjie mentioned Zhu Tianlei's name several times afterward. After Deng Luolin's viral infection, Zhu Tianlei became a role model for all of Yunhai City, even nationally.</p><p>However, this Zhu Tianlei was very low-key and did not use the opportunity to promote himself further. Apart from making a brief appearance in Yunhai Daily Life, he had never appeared on any media since then.</p><p>But the other party was Zhu Tianlei, and the matter suddenly made Deng Chang feel complicated. This person was Yang Wenjie's prized possession, someone whom he dared not provoke or wish to provoke.</p><p>However, the man lying on the ground howling like a pig was his subordinate. If he did nothing, it would be unjustifiable both morally and reasonably.</p><p>"Yes. Therefore, County Magistrate Deng, I suggest you don't get involved and pretend you didn't see anything!"</p><p>"County Magistrate Deng, Old Deng, you can't just ignore this! Over the years, I've worked diligently without any accomplishments to show for it; at least I've endured some hardships. You can't stand idly by while someone is dying!"</p><p>Seeing Governor Deng Chang's hesitation, Yang Zhongmin was terrified. Deng Chang was his only hope.</p><p>Because the county government was moving to a new office building in the next two days, all the security personnel on duty had been assigned to the new location for training. If Deng Chang were to leave, Zhu Tianlei would kill him.</p><p>"Little Zhu, how about this: you first let Zhongmin go, and we can talk things out properly. If Zhongmin has indeed committed any mistakes, I absolutely will not show mercy."</p><p>Facing Zhu Tianlei, Governor Deng Chang spoke with a hint of caution.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei almost did not think twice before rejecting Deng Chang's suggestion outright.</p><p>Deng Chang's face turned awkward.</p><p>"Governor Deng, you don't need to think about bringing reinforcements. Today, even if it were the Lord of Heaven himself, I, Zhu Tianlei, would not spare his face."</p><p>Deng Chang thought he had communicated with Da Liu in secret, but he did not expect that Zhu Tianlei still managed to notice. Deciding not to hide anymore,</p><p>"Little Zhu, Zhongmin is ultimately a government official. Although I am the governor, I cannot take matters into my own hands. This matter, I will report to Mayor Yang for his final decision!"</p><p>Deng Chang spoke rather boldly. Zhu Tianlei was like a treasure to Yang Wenjie, while Yang Zhongmin was his subordinate. Stranded in between them, Deng Chang found it difficult to act either way and decided to pass the buck.</p><p>Moreover, Deng Chang was actually five or six years older than Yang Wenjie, but for some reason, whenever he mentioned Yang Wenjie, he referred to him as "the elderly."</p><p>"Governor Deng, there's no need. I will take Yang Zhongmin with me, and I will personally explain the situation to Mayor Yang!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had already been quite courteous towards Deng Chang, but courtesy did not mean that he would spare Deng Chang's face.</p><p>With that said, Zhu Tianlei grabbed Yang Zhongmin by the arm, lifting him up as if he were a small chick. Yang Zhongmin, who was overweight, paled in fear as he was hoisted up by Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you shouldn't go too far......"</p><p>Deng Chang was after all the county magistrate, in charge of the economy and life of Dahan County's 400,000 residents. Being repeatedly insulted by a young novice like him made it impossible for him to keep up appearances.</p>

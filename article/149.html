						<p>Zhu Quezi glanced at Hou Suxin, and Hou Suxin looked back at Zhu Quezi. Their gazes exchanged in the air, and Zhu Tianlei blinked his eyes. He was too familiar with his parents; they were assigning tasks or discussing strategies! </p><p>After a moment, it was still Hou Suxin who spoke up.</p><p>"Tianlei, your fat aunt came by yesterday......"</p><p>From the opening remarks, Zhu Tianlei immediately sensed something unusual.</p><p>Fat Aunt excelled at gossiping about neighbors and matchmaking. If this was the former, Hou Suxin wouldn't be telling him; so it must be the latter.</p><p>"You're not that young anymore. In the past, our family's conditions were poor, and I and your father couldn't find anyone to arrange a match for you. Now that you've become famous in the surrounding villages, you can afford any kind of girl."</p><p>As she spoke, Hou Suxin unconsciously straightened her posture, exuding a sense of pride as if singing 'The Song of the Ex-slave.'</p><p>"So what?"</p><p>"Your fat aunt recommended someone to me and your mother. We both think she's good. She's the daughter of Yang Guang from Lotus Village. That girl is nineteen, beautiful with smooth skin, has a strong and large bottom, and will definitely be able to bear sons......"</p><p>Zhu Quezi took over, continuing Hou Suxin's unfinished sentence, especially when mentioning her large bottom and ability to bear sons, he couldn't hide his excitement and desire.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei rolled his eyes.</p><p>"Tianlei, don't think you're still young. You're twenty-one now, and in a few days, you'll be twenty-two. In the countryside, at this age, who doesn't want kids? Your father and I have secretly looked her over already......"</p><p>"Did you really go look?"</p><p>Facing Zhu Tianlei's shock, the couple felt immensely proud. Of course, their son's marriage was a serious matter. Whether Lotus Village was next door or eighty miles away, they wouldn't mind the distance.</p><p>A sense of helplessness instantly washed over Zhu Tianlei. He couldn't tell his parents about himself and those few women right now. After all, such matters were shocking and unconventional, and he didn't want to scare them.</p><p>But if he didn't say anything, there was no way to dispel their thoughts.</p><p>"Didn't you just say that the family's surname is Yang, and the young lady's father is named Yang Guang?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's eyes flickered as he suddenly remembered this question.</p><p>"Yes, the Yang family is one of the established households in the village, and Yang Guang holds an important position among the villagers. They have only one daughter, who is treated like a treasure..."</p><p>"Mommy, let me explain first."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei preemptively prepared for Hou Suqin's long-winded explanation.</p><p>"Your son had a conflict with Yang Guang before; when I went to Lotus Village and exposed Ge Dong's embezzlement of public funds, I even clashed with this Yang Guang. Think about it, if your son were to marry his daughter, could he still live in peace?"</p><p>As soon as Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, the couple's expressions immediately changed.</p><p>They knew about their son exposing Ge Dong's embezzlement, though they didn't know that it was because Ge Dong had kidnapped Ma Lanlan.</p><p>Regardless of the cause, since their son had clashed with Yang Guang before, wouldn't he be resentful?</p><p>They only had one son and couldn't afford to let him be bullied by his wife's family.</p><p>"Alright, go do your thing. We'll pretend I didn't mention this to you."</p><p>Zhu Tuizi felt very unhappy, upset that Fat Aunt hadn't mentioned it at all. Humph, Fat Aunt was clearly being manipulative, intentionally not telling them about it.</p><p>"Then I'm going to the company?"</p><p>Zhu Tuizi waved his hand, and Zhu Tianlei got up and left the room.</p><p>Zhu Tuizi and Hou Suqin exchanged a glance before Hou Suqin tidied herself up and left the house, naturally heading to Fat Aunt's place.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hummed a little tune, in good spirits.</p><p>Within a short period, it was estimated that his parents would no longer be able to take care of this matter for him.</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was about to reach the company gate, his phone suddenly rang.</p><p>"Director Li?"</p><p>On the other end of the line was Li Ping.</p><p>It turned out that the municipal hospital had admitted a patient whose condition was peculiar. The patient did not have any viral or bacterial infections, and no abnormalities were found in CT scans, yet they continuously vomited and diarrhea to the point of fainting.</p><p>What made it even more terrifying was that any infusion would immediately reflux once it entered the veins.</p><p>Almost all doctors from every department of the city hospital had participated in the consultation, but none could provide an explanation for the condition. The director lost his temper at the consultation meeting, and it is unclear who first suggested Zhu Tianlei's name; eventually, Director Li Ping was tasked with this mission.</p><p>"Tianlei, I know my request is a bit excessive, but the patient's identity is truly special, and our city hospital cannot afford to fail. Could you please come once or let me arrange for someone to pick you up?"</p><p>Li Ping spoke cautiously, knowing that this request was unreasonable. Zhu Tianlei was not a doctor at the city hospital, so he had no obligation to participate in treatment. Furthermore, he was now the president of a large pharmaceutical company, managing numerous tasks daily—why should he help?</p><p>However, the director's command was as heavy as Mount Tai, forcing Li Ping to make this call reluctantly.</p><p>"Director Li, you overestimate me. You've done me favors before, so consider this my way of repaying your kindness."</p><p>As soon as Zhu Tianlei spoke, Li Ping's heart immediately calmed down.</p><p>He knew that Zhu Tianlei was a man of integrity and gratitude. What he called helping Zhu Tianlei was actually Zhu Tianlei who had helped him countless times.</p><p>Nevertheless, an hour later, Li Ping met Zhu Tianlei at the entrance to the consultation hall in the hospital.</p><p>The consultation hall was the multimedia meeting room of the hospital. At this moment, there were approximately thirty doctors in the room, both male and female, ranging in age.</p><p>In the center sat an elderly man wearing gold-rimmed glasses, looking stern.</p><p>Beside the elder, there was a woman in her forties; judging from her demeanor and attire, she must have been of high status.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's appearance caused a slight commotion.</p><p>However, apart from Li Ping, no one else had experienced Zhu Tianlei’s miraculous medical skills firsthand. It was none other than Li Ping’s classmate, Bai Song, who requested Zhu Tianlei’s help for treatment.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, please come in."</p><p>Li Ping stood up first and welcomed Zhu Tianlei into the consultation hall. However, all the seats around the conference table were already occupied, and when they saw Zhu Tianlei approaching, no one made any move to give up their seat.</p><p>Li Ping’s expression turned awkward.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, however, paid no heed and casually pulled over a chair, sitting at the back.</p><p>"It's fine for me to sit here. Director Li, you can go do your work!"</p><p>Li Ping, who felt embarrassed by Zhu Tianlei’s ‘down-to-earth’ manner, broke out in a cold sweat on his back. He couldn’t help but glare at Bai Song, who was sitting beside him and crossing his legs.</p><p>"Are you Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>The hospital director, Wei Baoguo, glanced at Zhu Tianlei and said in a deep voice.</p><p>"Didn't the director know my name before inviting me here?"</p><p>In response to Wei Baoguo’s attitude, Zhu Tianlei retorted bluntly. He would give respect to those who treated him seriously, but he saw no need to be courteous to those who disdained him.</p>

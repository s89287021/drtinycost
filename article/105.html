						<p>"You...... What are you doing? Are you here to kill and silence someone?"</p><p>The man relied on his height and strength, completely ignoring Zhu Tianlei. However, he was now shocked by reality.</p><p>"Regardless of who you are or what your purpose is, it would be best for you to disappear from here before I lose my temper, otherwise don't blame me for being ruthless."</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei let go of the man's arm, and he thumped to the ground with a slap.</p><p>Seeing their leader fall to the ground, the faces of the dozen or so people nearby changed in unison.</p><p>"Hmph, let's go!"</p><p>The group came and went in a rush, which left Zhu Tianlei quite puzzled. However, at this moment, he had no time to think about it and turned around to continue treating the injured worker.</p><p>Little did he know that a crisis was looming.</p><p>Once the condition of the injured worker stabilized, Zhu Tianlei arranged for him to be carried back to bed and then prepared to call Mao Yu to brief him on the situation. After all, this matter was neither too big nor too small.</p><p>But before Zhu Tianlei could make the call, another group of people rushed in from Liang Xia.</p><p>This time, everyone was wearing dark blue work uniforms and peaked caps, looking like they were from the Administration for Industry and Commerce or the Urban Management Bureau.</p><p>"Who is in charge here?"</p><p>The leader, a man in his thirties, spoke first.</p><p>"I am. What seems to be the problem?"</p><p>Suspicious minds see sinister motives, Zhu Tianlei thought immediately.</p><p>"Somebody reported that there are illegal constructions and violations of construction regulations here. We need to seal off the construction site and halt work until we have thoroughly investigated the situation."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned.</p><p>"Report? Comrade, what department are you from? You said you would seal the construction site. Do you have any basis or procedures?"</p><p>After spending some time with Mao Yu, Zhu Tianlei had greatly improved in thinking, vision, and emotion, so his first reaction was not to fly into a rage but to verify.</p><p>"We are from the Administration for Industry and Commerce. Someone anonymously reported this over the phone. Our principle is to accept all cases and handle them accordingly. As for the basis, national laws are our guidelines. Please step aside; do not obstruct our law enforcement."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei kept a cold face. He had never interacted with the Administration for Industry and Commerce and was unaware of its role in the country's political structure.</p><p>If it were indeed an anonymous report rather than malicious retaliation, blocking them would be hindering judicial fairness and harmful to the situation at hand.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Zhu Tianlei chose to acquiesce, watching as they sealed the half-constructed building within the cordoned-off area with seals and warning tapes, almost imprisoning the burgeoning dreams inside.</p><p>"The reporter also mentioned that workers fell from an elevated operation platform due to high-pressure work, resulting in serious injuries. Is this true?"</p><p>The onlookers' faces turned grim upon hearing this. Who would be so tactless and malicious as to make such a complaint about such a good employer?</p><p>Though they thought so inwardly, no one dared speak out.</p><p>"There was indeed an accident where a worker fell from the operation platform, but the situation is now stable."</p><p>"Take me inside; we have a doctor with us who will assess the injured."</p><p>This meant that they did not believe Zhu Tianlei's words.</p><p>"Alright, the person is inside. Come take a look!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was not afraid of them seeing and would not be able to hide even if he were. It was better to face it head-on.</p><p>The group followed Zhu Tianlei into the cramped shed measuring less than ten square meters. The man who had been speaking to Zhu Tianlei earlier waved his hand, allowing a doctor in a white coat carrying a medical kit to enter from outside the crowd.</p><p>Xiao Yang, please take a careful look at the injured person and determine what caused their unconsciousness and the extent of their injuries?</p><p>The doctor nodded and sat beside the injured worker. He took out a stethoscope, handheld scanner, and other items from his medical bag. After some fumbling around, he stood up.</p><p>Captain Qi nodded and said, "Doctor, the patient is severely exhausted with mild pulmonary edema. It indeed suggests the possibility of high-pressure work. Moreover, he has a leg fracture, and although the wound has been treated, there is still a risk of infection. I recommend sending him to the city hospital for further examination and treatment immediately."</p><p>The doctor spoke confidently, while Zhu Tianlei listened attentively without interrupting. While what the doctor said was not incorrect, Zhu Tianlei could diagnose these symptoms through pulse diagnosis and spiritual energy transmission. The doctor seemed busy but did not actually perform a substantial physical examination on the patient. How did he come to this conclusion?</p><p>"We need to send the patient to the city hospital for treatment. As the person in charge and the primary bearer of accident responsibility, you must cover all treatment costs."</p><p>Captain Qi said sternly.</p><p>"This is natural, but I have a question for Captain Qi. Besides reporting these circumstances, did the informant also report that I was working without a license?"</p><p>Qi Lian was taken aback and didn't understand Zhu Tianlei's meaning. Did he think that the trouble was too small?</p><p>"It doesn't matter whether you have a license or not. The fact that a worker had an accident due to high-pressure work is enough for you to deal with!"</p><p>Qi Lian said and then directed his subordinates to carry the injured worker, Zhang Qiang, out.</p><p>"You need to go to the city with us as well. First, to pay for the patient's medical expenses, and second, to cooperate in our investigation and evidence collection."</p><p>"Alright, that's right. Please wait a few minutes, Captain Qi, while I finish up some things."</p><p>Qi Lian was satisfied with Zhu Tianlei's attitude and didn't argue about his request, leading his subordinates down the mountain first.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei briefly explained to the supervisor to reassure him, asked the workers to rest temporarily, and paid them as if they had worked normally before leaving.</p><p>Sitting in the car of Administrative Law, Zhu Tianlei glanced at the doctor opposite him and suddenly smiled.</p><p>"Doctor Yang, I didn't expect Doctor Yang, so young, to have such formidable diagnostic skills through observation, auscultation, inquiry, and palpation. Truly impressive!"</p><p>Yang Ning's face turned slightly flushed as he was called out. He turned his head and ignored Zhu Tianlei. Zhu Tianlei, however, did not get angry; instead, he placed both hands behind his head and kept staring at Yang Ning with a smile, making Yang Ning feel as uncomfortable as sitting on pins and needles. What should have been a short hour-long journey felt like several centuries.</p><p>Upon arriving at the car park, Yang Ning saw Zhu Tianlei glance at the gleaming golden letters of Yundai People's Hospital and felt quite reflective.</p><p>Before today, he had just caused a commotion in the ICU ward here. He did not expect to be back so soon, but what would be the outcome this time?</p><p>As medical staff rushed out to push Zhang Qiang into the hospital, Zhu Tianlei took a step forward to follow them but was pulled back by someone.</p>

						<p>"I know what farming means to everyone in Hama Gou, so I only want the right to rent these lands, not the ownership. I will calculate the compensation based on the yield of each mu of land and pay accordingly, while also compensating for some of the land degradation costs. Additionally, the pharmaceutical factory will prioritize hiring those who lease their land to the factory."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words had barely fallen when the meeting room erupted once more, this time even closer to boiling point than before.</p><p>The conditions Zhu Tianlei proposed were too tempting, but the villagers born and raised in Hama Gou still harbored a natural fear of the unknown.</p><p>No matter how good Zhu Tianlei sounded, his promises seemed as insubstantial as castles in the air. After all, setting up a pharmaceutical factory was no child's play; what if they lost their land without receiving any money, or if the factory failed to materialize?</p><p>"Tianlei, starting a pharmaceutical factory is a good thing, and Uncle supports it. If you need help with labor, I wouldn't mind getting my hands dirty, but this land... Uncle really can't give it up."</p><p>Zhang Haishan spoke, having three mu of land on the hill.</p><p>"It's fine; I understand where you're coming from, Uncle."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei genuinely understood, though there was a touch of disappointment deep within.</p><p>"Tianlei, my second uncle has always been ill these past years. It's all managed by my second aunt and me, with no extra money to spare at home. We survive on those few mu of land on the hill... look..."</p><p>"Second Aunt, I understand; you don't have to feel bad."</p><p>...</p><p>Soon, three or four people stood up one after another, politely declining, while Zhu Tianlei smiled, pretending understanding, but his heart sank.</p><p>Yao Gang's expression was also grim. Although he knew the process would not be smooth, he hadn't expected Zhu Tianlei's conditions to result in such immediate rejections without any consideration.</p><p>"Village head, don't put everyone in a difficult position; let's just pretend I never mentioned it."</p><p>After everyone had expressed their opinions, Zhu Tianlei turned to Yao Gang and prepared to leave, not wanting to stay and add to the embarrassment and disappointment.</p><p>But just as Zhu Tianlei was about to lift his foot, a voice came from the door.</p><p>My family's four mu of land, I give to Tianlei without a single cent. My life, Hu Dainiu, was saved by Tianlei. Don't say it's just land; even my life, I Hu Dainiu, would not hesitate to give.</p><p>Hu Dainiu spoke with great confidence, his voice reaching us before he arrived.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei saw Hu Dainiu panting at the door, his heart warmed up. At this moment, trust and support meant more than anything else.</p><p>"Though we only have two mu of land, I am willing to give it to Tianlei for free. If not for Tianlei, my father might have died from a strange illness."</p><p>Another person stood up.</p><p>"Tianlei, my uncle's three mu of land also goes to you. Uncle wants nothing in return; just manage the factory well and continue treating everyone at our clinic."</p><p>...</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's eyes were slightly misty with emotion.</p><p>"I Yao Gang will give my land to Tianlei for free without any payment. Moreover, if Tianlei needs help, I Yao Gang, along with my wife Liu Meixiang and son Yao Jianxiong, will be the first to step forward without hesitation."</p><p>After Yao Gang finished speaking, there was a brief silence in the room, after which several people who had previously refused to give up their farmland changed their minds and were willing to give it to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>In just a few minutes, the situation had completely changed.</p><p>There are a total of three mu and eight fen of neatly cultivated land on Hamagu Ridge. Apart from Sun Dafu who didn't attend today, the remaining three mu of land was all willing to be given to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Such a situation stirred up passion not only in Zhu Tianlei but also in people like Yao Gang and Tan Daquan, who were moved to the point of losing control.</p><p>It reminded them of the passionate days of going up mountains and down rivers, building the military corps, and vigorously engaging in production. Zhu Tianlei was not only a miracle doctor and village treasure for Hamagu but also resembled a spark that transformed a lifeless village into an ocean of enthusiasm.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the familiar faces before him and bowed deeply. He thanked these fellow villagers for their trust in him and for the land where he was born and raised.</p><p>Overwhelmed with emotion, Zhu Tianlei returned to the clinic. Ma Lanlan had already heard about what happened in the meeting and was equally excited. The two of them chatted enthusiastically for a while.</p><p>"Rulan, I have something to take care of. See you later!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remembered that the time he had agreed with Sun Dafu had arrived. He had already counted all the scattered pieces of land on Liang Shang, and since Sun Dafu's land was in the middle, he knew he had to secure it no matter what.</p><p>Ma Rulan also understood that starting a factory wasn't easy; there were too many things to worry about and prepare for. Therefore, she was very considerate. Regarding Mao Yu's matter, Zhu Tianlei had explained everything to her, and after learning about Mao Yu's identity and background, Ma Rulan was just as surprised as Zhu Tianlei had been back then.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood at Sun Dafu's doorstep, feeling slightly odd. Although they lived in the same village, this was his first time visiting Sun Dafu's door.</p><p>"Tap tap tap!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei knocked on the door. The sound of the iron gate echoed clearly, and a few light taps were enough to make it ring loudly.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei? What are you here for?"</p><p>Du Xingfen had been involved in the events of those years and was responsible for spreading rumors in the village. Moreover, she was a solitary woman who rarely left her house. Zhu Tianlei, having lived for twenty-one years, could count the number of times he had seen Du Xingfen on his fingers.</p><p>"Aunt Dafu, I'm here to see Uncle Dafu."</p><p>No matter what, he had a purpose in mind and didn't want to start any conflict over old matters from more than ten years ago with Du Xingfen.</p><p>"He's not home."</p><p>After saying that, Du Xingfen tried to close the door, but she saw Zhu Tianlei's two fingers wedged between them. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't close the door.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, what do you want?"</p><p>Du Xingfen glared sideways.</p><p>"Ah Big Auntie Fu, I made an appointment with Uncle Fu."</p><p>"Pah, what a load of nonsense you spout without thinking. Our two families have always kept to ourselves, never speaking when we meet. Would he make an appointment with you?"</p><p>Du Xingfen pinched her waist and put on a rural housewife's face.</p><p>"Didn't Uncle Fu tell you?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei raised his voice.</p><p>"What did he say? Come come come, I'm just a woman here. You standing there, neither in nor out, makes people gossip."</p><p>"Since Uncle Fu isn't here, it's the same if I talk to Big Auntie Fu you."</p><p>Seeing that Zhu Tianlei had no intention of leaving and his words seemed to hold deeper meaning, Du Xingfen grew suspicious. After all, their families hadn't interacted in years; as they say, anything unusual must have a reason.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"It's like this, the day before yesterday afternoon, I......"</p>

						<p>"Doctor Zhao really knows all about my case. Since that's the case, why don't you tell me whom this habitual offender has 'cured'?"</p><p>"This... Hmph, what if he didn't kill anyone? You're a barefoot doctor from the countryside without a medical license treating people; that's illegal!"</p><p>Of course, Zhao Zhiguo wouldn't be foolish enough to reveal the outcome of Ruan Tianlei's previous treatments. If he did, not only would he fail to get rid of Ruan Tianlei, but he himself could end up in trouble.</p><p>As long as he insisted that Ruan Tianlei lacked a medical license, Ruan Tianlei was as good as dead!</p><p>"Who says Doctor Zhao doesn't have a medical license?"</p><p>At this moment, someone suddenly walked out from the door. It wasn't anyone else but Yang Hua, the director of the county hospital's internal medicine department.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo frowned; he had never met Yang Hua before, only knowing of his existence.</p><p>"Doctor Zhao must have heard of my name. I am Director Yang Hua from the Internal Medicine Department of the County Hospital."</p><p>What?</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo's heart sank.</p><p>What made Zhao Zhiguo even more dismayed was that the woman who had been speaking earlier suddenly turned around when she heard Yang Hua's voice.</p><p>"Dad, why are you here?"</p><p>"I came to deliver something to Doctor Zhao."</p><p>Yang Hua looked at his beloved daughter with a gentle tone.</p><p>"Is he really a doctor?"</p><p>Yang Jing's face was full of shock, but these words were from her father. Her father had been the person she admired most since childhood, so she naturally wouldn't doubt his words, but what exactly was going on?</p><p>"Not only is he a doctor, but he was personally recommended by my dad and received an appointment letter directly from the hospital president. In the county hospital, his status is even higher than that of my dad and me!"</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo was somewhat confused, and Li Ping standing beside him looked equally dumbfounded. He suddenly recalled what Zhu Tianlei had told him earlier. Zhao Zhiguo couldn't possibly be unaware of this kid's identity; could he really be using him as a scapegoat?</p><p>An unnamed rage burned fiercely in Li Ping's heart.</p><p>"Director Yang, you can't just say things like that. You can't say such things to cover up for this kid. As an experienced doctor, you should at least have some medical ethics!"</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo, of course, was unwilling to give up so easily. He didn't believe it would be such a coincidence that he had reported the incident and the county hospital immediately issued an appointment letter, even delivering it here. There must be a conspiracy!</p><p>"Medical ethics? Doctor Zhao, you should think twice about using these words!"</p><p>Yang Hua detested Zhao Zhiguo with every fiber of his being.</p><p>Yang Jing originally had a good impression of Zhao Zhiguo, but upon hearing him speak disrespectfully to her father, she immediately became displeased.</p><p>"Doctor Zhao, if the whistleblower provides false cases or even fabricates facts, and they are discovered, it is still considered illegal behavior."</p><p>Cold sweat broke out all over Zhao Zhiguo's body.</p><p>But once an arrow is shot, there's no turning back. He would rather die than let Zhu Tianlei escape punishment!</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo glanced at the lifeless Old Master Ge on the bed. He had never believed that Zhu Tianlei's medical skills were so high; the previous few times must have been mere luck, like a blind cat catching a dead mouse.</p><p>Moreover, he had heard from Li Ping about this patient whose spleen had been pierced by a sharp object and who also suffered from severe coronary heart disease. Many imported drugs could not be used on him, and it was only due to the family's insistence and spending tens of thousands of dollars daily that he was still alive.</p><p>So, regardless of whether Old Master Ge died because of Zhu Tianlei or not, this black mark would fall on him.</p><p>"Director Li, I have a question to consult with you."</p><p>Just as Yang Jing was hesitating over Zhao Zhiguo's words, Zhu Tianlei, who had been standing by and observing coldly the entire time, suddenly spoke up.</p><p>Li Ping was taken aback and looked at Zhu Tianlei in confusion.</p><p>"Is the patient bleeding into shock due to a ruptured spleen, with bile leaking into the abdominal cavity and causing secondary infection?"</p><p>Li Ping's eyes widened in shock. Zhu Tianlei was spot on; indeed, that was the case. Besides coronary heart disease, the old man also had severe fatty liver disease, which meant his blood loss was greater than that of an ordinary person.</p><p>"According to the hospital's treatment plan, it should be open surgery to repair the patient's liver and remove the gallbladder. However, given that the patient has severe fatty liver disease and coronary heart disease, undergoing surgery would directly lead to massive liver bleeding. Therefore, you are currently relying on medication to sustain the patient, and they could stop breathing at any moment, correct?"</p><p>Li Ping stared at Zhu Tianlei as if he were a monster. Had this person seen the patient's medical records before, or had someone leaked information about the patient?</p><p>"How did you know?"</p><p>After some hesitation, Li Ping managed to ask haltingly.</p><p>"Director Li means that everything I said is correct, right?"</p><p>Li Ping nodded involuntarily; not only was it correct, but it was spot on.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, don't think asking these questions will let you off the hook. As long as the patient had vital signs before you acted, you are responsible for improper treatment and causing their death. Moreover..."</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo's eyes were bloodshot, and the flames of hatred had burned away his reason.</p><p>"Director Yang said you were a specially appointed physician at the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, but that's just hearsay. Who knows if he is deliberately covering for you?"</p><p>"This is my appointment letter, along with my qualification certificate. Doctor Zhao, take a look!"</p><p>Yang Hua reached into her bag and threw a folder directly to Zhao Zhiguo.</p><p>Zhaoguozhuang opened the file folder, and the three characters "Zhutianlei" seemed like a sharp sword directly piercing Zhaoguozhuang's heart.</p><p>"Grandpa, you're awake?"</p><p>Zhaoguozhuang stiffened his body, unable to believe as he looked at the hospital bed.</p><p>Ge Yang screamed out in shock and helped Ge Laoyazi sit up.</p><p>Everyone in the room was stunned, except for Zhutianlei!</p><p>Zhaoguozhuang looked at Zhutianlei with a pale face.</p><p>"You......you're not human, not human......impossible......absolutely impossible!"</p><p>Li Ping reacted quickly, rushing to Ge Laoyazi's bedside. He didn't believe it; this couldn't be true!</p><p>"Grandpa, look at me, I'm Little Yang!"</p><p>"Good grandson..."</p><p>Although the three words were weak, they were enough to shatter Zhaoguozhuang's hope and Li Ping's doubts.</p><p>"Doctor Zhao, you're defaming me, fabricating facts to send me to prison, even pulling out the power source of the monitoring equipment. What are your motives?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>The file folder in Zhaoguozhuang's hand fell to the ground. How could Zhutianlei know about this?</p><p>"Director Li, why don't you go check it yourself and see if someone pulled out the power source of the monitoring equipment!"</p><p>Li Ping glanced at Zhaoguozhuang and then quickly went to the power control room with Geng Wenxue.</p><p>Time trickles away, second by second.</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo felt that his entire life had not been as long as these few short minutes.</p><p>"Zhao Zhiguo, I really misjudged you!"</p><p>Five minutes later, Li Ping and Geng Wenxue returned. The moment they entered the door, Li Ping pointed at Zhao Zhiguo and raged.</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo glanced at everyone present and suddenly rolled his eyes before collapsing to the ground.</p>

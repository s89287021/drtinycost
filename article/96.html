						<p>"How much of the seedling compensation money did you get from the city? How much land compensation did you receive? And how much compensation did you get for the Daqing Mountain Enclosure Forest Transformation Project?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke calmly. The three questions, concerning three different types of compensation, seemed like a boulder thrown into a pond; with a splash, the pond turned into an ocean, causing waves to crash against the shore.</p><p>"The city's seedling compensation is 75 yuan per mu of land, and the land compensation is 124 yuan per mu. The enclosure forest transformation project compensation is 380 yuan per household."</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, a woman in a light blue cotton blouse emerged from the crowd.</p><p>"Did you say that money was given for the Daqing Mountain Enclosure Forest Transformation?"</p><p>The woman looked at Zhu Tianlei to clarify.</p><p>"Yes, this money was already distributed at the beginning of spring. Didn't you receive it?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei also seemed surprised.</p><p>The woman's face immediately turned extremely ugly.</p><p>"The seedling compensation is 75 yuan per mu of land?"</p><p>Another person stepped forward and asked.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded firmly.</p><p>"The land compensation is 124 yuan per mu of land?"</p><p>This time, it was Old Yang who spoke, his gaze somewhat vacant.</p><p>"That's right."</p><p>For the villagers' questions, Zhu Tianlei answered affirmatively with great patience.</p><p>"How much seedling compensation money did you receive from the city? How much land compensation have you gotten? And how much compensation did you get for the Daqing Mountain Enclosure Forest Transformation Project?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke calmly. The three questions, regarding three different forms of compensation, felt like a boulder thrown into a pond; with a splash, the pond turned into an ocean, causing waves to crash against the shore.</p><p>"The city provides 75 yuan per mu for seedling compensation and 124 yuan per mu for land compensation. The enclosure forest transformation project offers 380 yuan per household."</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, a woman in a light blue cotton blouse emerged from the crowd.</p><p>"Did you say that money was provided for the Daqing Mountain Enclosure Forest Transformation?"</p><p>The woman looked at Zhu Tianlei to clarify.</p><p>"Yes, this money was already distributed at the beginning of spring. Didn't you receive it?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei also seemed surprised.</p><p>The woman's face immediately turned extremely ugly.</p><p>"The seedling compensation is 75 yuan per mu of land?"</p><p>Another person stepped forward and asked.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded firmly.</p><p>"The land compensation is 124 yuan per mu of land?"</p><p>This time, it was Old Yang who spoke, his gaze somewhat vacant.</p><p>"That's correct."</p><p>For the villagers' questions, Zhu Tianlei answered affirmatively with great patience.</p><p>"How much seedling compensation did you receive from the city? How about your land compensation? And what about the compensation for the Daqing Mountain Enclosure Forest Transformation Project?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke calmly. The three questions, each concerning a different type of compensation, seemed like a boulder tossed into a pond; with a splash, the tranquil water turned into an ocean, sending waves crashing against the shore.</p><p>"The city offers 75 yuan per mu for seedling compensation and 124 yuan per mu for land compensation. The enclosure forest transformation project provides each household with 380 yuan."</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, a woman in a light blue cotton blouse stepped forward from the crowd.</p><p>"Did you say that there was money for the Daqing Mountain Enclosure Forest Transformation?"</p><p>The woman looked at Zhu Tianlei, seeking clarification.</p><p>"Yes, this funds were distributed at the beginning of spring. Didn't you receive it?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei seemed equally surprised.</p><p>The woman's face immediately darkened.</p><p>"The seedling compensation is 75 yuan per mu of land?"</p><p>Another villager stepped forward and asked.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded firmly in response.</p><p>"What about the land compensation, at 124 yuan per mu of land?"</p><p>This time, it was Old Yang who spoke, his expression somewhat vacant.</p><p>"That's correct."</p><p>For each of the villagers' queries, Zhu Tianlei patiently confirmed with a nod.</p><p>Ge Dong lay on the ground beside them, his face ashen.</p><p>"Ge Dong, you damn dog!"</p><p>Yang Lao Tou suddenly turned around and kicked Ge Dong. The villagers who had spoken up earlier also rushed forward, surrounding Ge Dong in the middle while Zhu Tianlei was pushed to the outer edge.</p><p>Ge Dong found himself at a loss for words, let alone daring to speak even if he could.</p><p>It was too easy to gather evidence in such a situation; every piece of evidence would be accurate. Therefore, all he could do was curse Zhu Tianlei's ancestors in his heart.</p><p>"If you want evidence, why not ask your village accountant at the village office? This sum of money is no small amount."</p><p>As soon as Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, the villagers immediately responded. Yang Lao Tou raised his arm and led the villagers out of the courtyard towards the village office.</p><p>Ge Dong became an ignored existence, at least temporarily.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei placed Ma Lanlan on the ground and crouched beside Ge Dong.</p><p>Ge Dong looked at Zhu Tianlei as if he were seeing a monster. He couldn't understand how Zhu Tianlei knew about this matter. If he had known earlier, no matter how stupid he was, he would not have laid a hand on Ma Lanlan.</p><p>"Party Secretary Ge, heaven's punishment can be endured, but self-inflicted suffering cannot be tolerated. Since you dared to touch my woman, you must prepare to bear everything!"</p><p>Ge Dong looked at Zhu Tianlei, shaking his head in agitation.</p><p>"Party Secretary Ge wants to speak?"</p><p>Ge Dong nodded again.</p><p>"Don't worry, Party Secretary Ge will open his mouth to speak, but not now, and not at home."</p><p>Ge Dong's eyes widened as he did not understand the meaning of Zhu Tianlei's words.</p><p>"It was in the prison, and I fear I won't be able to get out for the rest of my life!"</p><p>Said that, Zhu Tianlei stood up.</p><p>Ge Dong looked up but could only raise his head slightly. At this moment, the sun was setting in the west, with twilight covering the sky. Zhu Tianlei bathed in the blood-red sunset, and Ge Dong felt as though he had provoked not one person, but a killing god.</p><p>He rubbed his pocket, and a silver needle shot out from between his fingers. Ge Dong felt his back tighten as a hot stream trickled down his trouser hem.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei rode the electric bike, with Ma Lanlan sitting on the rear rack. The two of them slowly moved forward through the high cornfield that was about a person's height.</p><p>"Tianlei, how did you know about Ge Dong embezzling public funds?"</p><p>Ma Lanlan thought for a long time but still couldn't understand it. Zhu Tianlei wasn't particularly concerned with such matters; he wasn't an official and didn't even know Ge Dong well.</p><p>"It was all thanks to your efforts!"</p><p>"My efforts?"</p><p>Ma Lanlan was completely lost, what did this have to do with that?</p><p>"Don't you remember telling me earlier that the compensation for the afforestation project in Liánhuā Village hadn't arrived yet?"</p><p>Ma Lanlan nodded. She had indeed said that, but she hadn't mentioned that Ge Dong embezzled the money!</p><p>"Stupid girl, I'm actually not sure either; it was all just a bluff."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Ma Lanlan screamed in disbelief. He wasn't sure either?</p><p>Clearly, he spoke with such certainty, as if success was within his grasp.</p><p>"Alan, remember, no matter what, you must protect yourself. You can be angry at me or ignore me, but you must let me know where you are. I never want to experience something like this again in my lifetime. Promise me."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's voice came from ahead, muffled and barely audible, yet Ma Alanlan couldn't help but shed tears all over her face.</p><p>She hugged Zhu Tianlei around the waist, her face pressed against his back.</p><p>"I promise you, Tianlei. I promise!"</p><p>The evening breeze carried the scent of green grass far away.</p><p>Two figures of different heights stood close together in the afterglow of the setting sun, their shadows stretched by the sunset. Smoke from distant chimneys rose gently, everything was utterly serene.</p><p>Along the way, Ma Alanlan softly sang a song.</p><p>"I don't want to say I'm so affectionate, I don't want to say I'm so pure, but I can't refuse the feelings in my heart. Look at the cute sky and touch the real face, I understand your mood. There are many loves I can reject, many dreams I can skip, but I can't forget your smile..."</p><p>Ma Alanlan's voice was very pleasant, soft and gentle. This song was familiar to all Generation Y people, and Zhu Tianlei hummed along too.</p><p>The electric vehicle slowly drove through the village road. When it was almost dark, the two entered the village.</p><p>"Tianlei, I love you!"</p><p>Because of their previous experience, Zhu Tianlei insisted on seeing Ma Alanlan home. When they reached the entrance of Ma's house and Zhu Tianlei tried to leave, Ma Alanlan suddenly spoke behind him.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's body jolted, wanting to confirm again when Ma Alanlan pushed open the door and entered the courtyard.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked up just as a crescent moon hung on a branch.</p><p>The moon above willows, people appointed after dusk!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's mind suddenly popped out a line of an ancient poem that he didn't know who wrote, feeling that the ancients were truly damn talented and said it so well!</p><p>The entire day was spent in melodrama; Zhu Tianlei felt abnormally exhausted both physically and mentally. When he got home, he quickly washed his face and climbed onto the bed.</p><p>However, despite being totally tired, Zhu Tianlei tossed and turned until nearly midnight before finally falling into a drowsy sleep.</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei opened his eyes and hazily glanced at the wall clock that was older than himself.</p><p>"Shit, it's almost ten o'clock!"</p><p>Thinking about all the things he still had to do, Zhu Tianlei didn't dare to waste even a minute. He jumped up immediately.</p><p>All the thoughts from last night were temporarily pushed aside.</p><p>The Housu Qin couple had already gone out into the fields; they left a small basin of rice, a bowl of steamed chicken cake, and a small bowl of steamed meat for Zhu Tianlei in the pot.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hastily ate a few bites of rice before leaving home, but he was stopped by several people from the same village before he even reached the clinic.</p>

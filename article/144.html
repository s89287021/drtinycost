						<p>"Haha, Zhu Tianlei, what boldness! Don't you want to know who I am?"</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, the man laughed loudly as if he had heard something extremely funny.</p><p>"You and I have nothing to do with each other."</p><p>Hehe!</p><p>The man sitting on the tiger-head chair could not help but sit up straight. This Zhu Tianlei was really impressive, but he would soon find out that being impressive required capital; there were some people he could provoke, while others he couldn't afford to offend.</p><p>"You brat, did you save that old beast Ge Tianying?"</p><p>The man stared at Zhu Tianlei and asked him word by word.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei put his hands behind his back without answering because he knew the other party already knew the answer.</p><p>"Stinky brat, my brother is asking you a question. Are you deaf?"</p><p>Seeing that Zhu Tianlei did not answer, a long-haired man standing beside them, with a face full of sores, pointed at Zhu Tianlei and shouted.</p><p>The oily-looking man glanced at this guy but remained silent.</p><p>He now understood that the gun targeted the showy bird; especially when facing Zhu Tianlei, they couldn't outdo him in strength or cunning. Even putting on an act was beneath his level. Therefore, if he wanted to seek attention, let this guy do it himself!</p><p>The man on the tiger-head chair glanced at Zhu Tianlei but did not speak. It seemed that the long-haired man had gotten some encouragement.</p><p>"Damn it, is he mute? Playing cool in front of our Black Eagle Society brothers is asking for trouble!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei suddenly turned his head and stared at the long-haired man with a freezing gaze that pierced to the bone.</p><p>"You... you look at what, keep looking... I..."</p><p>"Are you the Black Eagle Society?"</p><p>"Yes, now do you know fear? Better kneel down early and beg for forgiveness from the boss. We might leave you with your full body intact, otherwise......"</p><p>The shoulder-length-haired man heard Zhu Tianlei's words and saw a flash of astonishment in Zhu Tianlei's eyes. He thought the other was intimidated by the name Black Eagle Society, regaining some courage.</p><p>"Full body......"</p><p>"Yes, we'll leave you with your.....cough cough cough......"</p><p>Before the shoulder-length-haired man could finish his sentence, he felt a shadow flash before his eyes and then his neck was grabbed by someone.</p><p>The action was swift as a startled swallow.</p><p>Everyone in the room stared at Zhu Tianlei as if they had seen a ghost.</p><p>They had been watching him all along, yet they were completely unaware of how he got to the shoulder-length-haired man's side.</p><p>The man in the tiger-head chair's face turned dark.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you have tremendous audacity!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei grabbed the shoulder-length-haired man by the neck. Although he didn't use deadly force, it still made the man's face turn red as pork liver, his eyes white with terror.</p><p>"Yes? Then let me show you what true courage is......"</p><p>That was why he asked Zheng Xiuxiu to bring Zhu Tianlei here instead of their headquarters. It was because he felt secure here; after all, Zhu Tianlei's strength was extraordinary.</p><p>But now, Zhu Tianlei carried the draped man in his arms and seemed to be moving as if he were riding a windfire wheel; or rather, even a windfire wheel wouldn't have been that fast. Before the man could react, Zhu Tianlei had already thrown him onto someone else's back.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood above with one foot on the draped man’s chest, pinning him down so that he couldn’t move at all.</p><p>By the time others reacted, it was too late.</p><p>"You are that ungrateful thug who intended to kill his benefactor, who had raised you to become the deputy leader of the gang—heartless and more beastly than an animal, Qin Zhuang?"</p><p>The Black Eagle Society split off from the Black Eagle Gang, hence the difference in just one character. Qin Zhuang was a beggar whom Ge Tianying had found on the streets and nurtured into becoming a weakling child before ultimately rising to become the deputy leader of the Black Eagle Gang.</p><p>However, four years ago, Qin Zhuang suddenly left the Black Eagle Gang with his brothers to establish the Black Eagle Society. Without knowledge of their shared origins, it was difficult for outsiders to distinguish between the two factions.</p><p>Consequently, the Black Eagle Society, under the banner of the Black Eagle Gang, engaged in all sorts of nefarious activities. Qin Zhuang’s attack on Ge Tianying was prompted by Ge’s stern demand that Qin dissolve the Black Eagle Society and cease his criminal activities. In his anger, Qin actually stabbed Ge Tianying in the abdomen with a dagger he carried.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had learned about this incident from Zu Hai.</p><p>"Pah, what do you know? I, Qin Zhuang, have served the Black Eagle Gang for thirty years and what have I gained? I was always just considered a dog by Ge Tianying. After his death, wouldn’t the leadership of the Black Eagle Gang pass to that little brat Ge Yang? Why should I bow down to some yellow-haired kid like him? This is what Ge Tianying owes me...."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei’s words inflamed Qin Zhuang's emotions.</p><p>"Qin Zhuang, without Old Master Ge, you wouldn’t even be a dog; you’d be a dead one."</p><p>"You...”</p><p>Qin Zhuang was so furious at Zhu Tianlei that he nearly spat blood.</p><p>"Qin Zhuang, where is Zheng Xiuxiu’s ex-husband? Hand him over and I’ll spare your life!"</p><p>Zheng Xiuxiu didn’t expect Zhu Tianlei to say such a thing at this moment. She raised her head to speak but hesitated.</p><p>"Pah, Zhu Tianlei, do you really think you’re as great as Lan Bo? You can easily enter my territory, but getting out—ha! Impossible!"</p><p>Qin Zhuang was undoubtedly a gang boss. No matter how cunning, ruthless, or despicable he was, he always had his courage. Facing the threat from Zhu Tianlei, he showed no sign of fear.</p><p>"Brothers, grab your weapons....."</p><p>Hearing Qin Zhuang's words, Zheng Xiuxiu's face turned pale immediately.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, please leave quickly! It's my fault that you're in this situation. Please go!"</p><p>Zheng Xiuxiu had been in Black Eagle Society for a few years and knew everything about it. She was well aware of what Qin Zhuang meant by "grab your weapons."</p><p>She had already wronged Zhu Tianlei several times, and now she regretted it. She didn't want him to lose his life. If they couldn't be together in this world, she would accept becoming ghostly husband and wife in the afterlife.</p><p>"Want to leave? Too late!"</p><p>Qin Zhuang gave a cold snort. Anything from his arsenal of weapons could easily take Zhu Tianlei's life.</p><p>"Did I say I wanted to leave?"</p><p>As soon as Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, Zheng Xiuxiu was slightly bewildered.</p><p>"Brave!"</p><p>Qin Zhuang sighed, but it seemed like some kind of signal, and the twenty people in the room suddenly rushed towards a corner of the house.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei moved his feet, and the man with shoulder-length hair flew out, crashing into the backs of the crowd. At the same time, Zhu Tianlei grabbed Qin Zhuang's arm, lifting the 170-pound Qin Zhuang as if he were a sack filled with cotton.</p>

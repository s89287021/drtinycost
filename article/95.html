						<p>Lying on Zhu Tianlei's broad and sturdy shoulders, Ma Lanlan, who had been struggling and suppressing her fear and despair, finally released her emotions. She soon soaked Zhu Tianlei's clothes with her tears.</p><p>"Don't be afraid, I'm here; no one can hurt you anymore!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei gently patted Ma Lanlan's back, his movements gentle as if he were caressing a rare artifact.</p><p>"Lanlan, let's go!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei carried Ma Lanlan horizontally in his arms and walked directly towards the exit.</p><p>Ma Lanlan glanced at Ge Dong, who lay motionless on the ground, a trace of doubt flickering in her eyes.</p><p>"Tianlei, is...... he dead?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei coldly glared at Ge Dong on the ground without pausing for a moment.</p><p>"Letting him die like this would be too easy for him. Besides, such scum doesn't deserve to dirty my hands!"</p><p>Hearing that the person wasn't dead, Ma Lanlan's heart settled. She didn't want Zhu Tianlei to get into trouble.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei carried Ma Lanlan out of the cellar, but as he reached the door, he saw the yard filled with people who had appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>Ma Lanlan's heart skipped a beat.</p><p>In rural areas, there was an unwritten custom: no matter how unpopular or hated a person was in the village, if they were bullied by someone from outside, it was absolutely unacceptable—basically, protecting one's own.</p><p>But why these people had come, it was impossible that they knew about Ge Dong binding Ma Lanlan and came to rescue her. On the contrary, they must be supporting Ge Dong.</p><p>"Who are you? Where did you take Secretary Ge?"</p><p>The leader was an old man in his sixties, with a gaunt face, but he had a powerful voice that reverberated like a buzz when he shouted.</p><p>"Yes, where is Secretary Ge?"</p><p>Others chimed in agreement.</p><p>A group of people, young and old, numbering in the dozens, crowded together with an imposing presence.</p><p>They immediately questioned Zhang Kou about Ge Dong, suggesting that he hadn't dealt a harsh enough blow, allowing Ge Dong to send out a warning message.</p><p>From this, it seemed clear that Ge Dong had only sent a brief distress message without being able to explain everything, hence their questioning of him.</p><p>"Ge Dong is in their cellar!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei coldly stated.</p><p>There was no need for him to lie about this matter since they would eventually find out.</p><p>"Let's go check. The four of you, watch these two people. Don't let them go until Secretary Ge comes out!"</p><p>The old man ordered several young men to keep an eye on Zhu Tianlei and Ma Lanlan, while he entered the house with a few others.</p><p>The inexperienced youths looked visibly nervous, clutching shovels and pickaxes, intently staring at the two of them.</p><p>"Tianlei, won't there be trouble?"</p><p>Ma Lanlan nestled in Zhu Tianlei's arms, quietly asked.</p><p>"Of course, there will be trouble!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan's face turned pale with anxiety as she tightly clung to Zhu Tianlei's clothes, her dark eyes filled with regret and panic.</p><p>"Stupid girl, I'm talking about Ge Dong being in trouble!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan didn't understand, how could this be possible?</p><p>They were currently in Xiao Lianhua Village, and she had clearly seen Ge Dong being slapped across the room by Zhu Tianlei and then becoming motionless. There were also people in the courtyard staring menacingly at them; no matter how one looked at it, the trouble was between her and Zhu Tianlei!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled slightly but didn't say anything more, merely squeezing Ma Lanlan's small hand.</p><p>A few minutes later, footsteps echoed through the room as the people who had gone in earlier carried Ge Dong out.</p><p>The moment he saw Zhu Tianlei, Ge Dong's eyes turned sharp with hatred.</p><p>"Secretary Ge, is it this brat?"</p><p>Ge Dong didn't know what exactly Zhu Tianlei had done to him; his entire body felt as though the muscles had been torn out. He could only move his small arm and fingers, while the rest of his body was completely immobile, and he couldn't even make a sound.</p><p>So when Old Yang asked him something, he couldn't speak but could only glare fiercely at Zhu Tianlei and nod vigorously.</p><p>"Arrest him, lock him up!"</p><p>Old Yang's orders were given with great authority, even more so than Ge Dong's. With one command, the several young men who had been guarding Zhu Tianlei rushed towards him.</p><p>Ma Lanlan screamed in fright, her complexion turning pale.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei held Ma Lanlan, reached out to press her head against his chest, and then shifted his feet, spinning around like a phantom to stand beside Old Yang instantly.</p><p>"What right do you have to arrest me?"</p><p>Old Yang had been waiting for Zhu Tianlei to be arrested, only to suddenly hear someone speaking beside him. He jumped in fright, turned around to see it was Zhu Tianlei, and his old face immediately paled.</p><p>"You...you...you..."</p><p>Old Yangtou felt his eyes were playing tricks on him, but after rubbing them for a long time, his face was smeared with eye gunk, Zhu Tianlei still stood clearly beside him.</p><p>"What's up with you? Apart from Ge Dong in Little Lotus Village, who else is trustworthy enough to speak their mind? Step forward!"</p><p>After being shocked for a while, Old Yangtou quickly calmed down. Come on, he had lived through storms and rains for most of his life; in this Little Lotus Village, even Ge Dong would give him some respect. When did it become the turn of this brat to show off before him?</p><p>"Humph, these times really have changed. A criminal still has such audacity, I Yang Guang would love to hear what you have to say."</p><p>"Can you speak on behalf of Ge Dong?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at Old Yangtou with a dark and unclear gaze.</p><p>"Third son, do you think I can speak for you or not?"</p><p>Ge Dong looked at Old Yangtou and felt depressed. What time was it? This old man still had the energy to show off. However, under current circumstances, he could only rely on this man whom he dared not provoke openly but despised deeply in his heart. Therefore, he nodded with certainty.</p><p>Old Yangtou gave Zhu Tianlei a look of smug satisfaction and looked up at the sky through his nose.</p><p>"Spit it out now, what do you have to say? Just remember, all the elders and villagers of Little Lotus Village are here. If one word you say is wrong, don't even think about leaving this village!"</p><p>As if in response to Old Yangtou's words, the villagers crowded in the courtyard started to echo his statement, giving it an almost courtroom atmosphere.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei gave a faint smile and pointed at Ge Dong.</p><p>"Ge Dong misappropriated the village's public funds. Can you take responsibility for this matter?"</p><p>What?</p><p>Old Yangtou was taken aback. He had imagined various possibilities but never thought that Zhu Tianlei would end up saying such words.</p><p>When the villagers heard about misappropriation of public funds, they were also bewildered and looked at Zhu Tianlei in confusion, then glanced at Ge Dong.</p><p>Ma Lanlan, who was still in Zhu Tianlei's arms, was stunned. Ge Dong was even more stunned by Zhu Tianlei's words and momentarily forgot about the deep-seated hatred between them. The courtyard was deathly silent; there was no trace of summer breeze, nor any sound from falling flowers.</p><p>"You.....what do you mean by that?"</p><p>It took a long while for Old Yang to regain his voice, and he stammered as he asked.</p>

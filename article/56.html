						<p>Although he had previously guessed at Li Xu's thoughts, when the scene unfolded before him, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but tremble. He did have a bad impression of Li Xu, but it certainly wasn't to the point where he hoped for his death.</p><p>A moment later, Zhu Tianlei knelt beside Li Xu. Li Xu was unconscious!</p><p>"Hey, who are you to this man?"</p><p>The driver of the sedan got out of the car, clearly furious. He had been driving perfectly until that person suddenly crashed into him; what bad luck!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei placed his hand on Li Xu's back, allowing the spiritual energy in his palm to flow slowly into Li Xu's body. He could already feel Li Xu's life force fading rapidly.</p><p>"If you don't know who he is, keep away. This man still has some breath left; if he dies later, you'll have to take responsibility!"</p><p>"Get out of the way!"</p><p>The ambulance and police arrived quickly, within just seven or eight minutes.</p><p>Two doctors in white coats squeezed through the crowd, one man and one woman.</p><p>"Who are you? You actually lifted the injured person. Do you know how easy it is for you to take his life? Move away quickly!"</p><p>The female doctor had a sharp voice. Seeing Zhu Tianlei holding Li Xu, she frowned deeply.</p><p>After saying that, the female doctor tried to pull Zhu Tianlei away, but no matter how hard she tugged, he remained immobile.</p><p>"Are you deaf? The injured person is losing too much blood. If you don't let go now, will you be able to bear the responsibility if the injured person dies?"</p><p>Dr. Woman's voice rose again, but Zhu Tianlei remained oblivious.</p><p>"He has suffered severe injuries to his liver and spleen, with bleeding points on his liver. I have managed to stop the internal bleeding in his abdomen, but the intracranial hemorrhage is also critical. I need to administer acupuncture; please help!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei infused a large amount of spiritual energy into Li Xu's body, which temporarily preserved his life. However, if the intracranial hemorrhage could not be controlled, Li Xu was still at risk of death. Therefore, he had to proceed with the acupuncture.</p><p>"What nerve! Who are you?"</p><p>"I am a doctor!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei reached out and pulled out his needle case, placing it on the ground and unfolding it. After being soaked for some time by Zhu Tianlei, the silver needles were bright and shimmered with white light.</p><p>"You are a doctor? Which hospital's doctor are you? Show me your ID!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was determined to save Li Xu and did not want to waste words with Dr. Woman, so he remained silent and picked up the silver needles, accurately piercing Fengchi point.</p><p>"What are you doing? You're killing him! Move out of the way; if you don't move I'll call the police!"</p><p>Dr. Woman's shout brought over the traffic police officers who were originally examining the accident scene, as well as onlookers exchanging opinions.</p><p>"Officer, this person is obstructing our efforts to treat the injured patient. Not only does he ignore our advice but also administers acupuncture without authorization. His actions may worsen the patient's condition and even cause immediate death!"</p><p>Dr. Woman spoke with authority, frowning. In theory, such matters were not within their jurisdiction, but seeing Zhu Tianlei holding the injured Li Xu did not appear to be a doctor either. After hesitating for a moment, he positioned himself in front of Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Regardless of your identity, please hand over the patient to the paramedics and cooperate!"</p><p>The traffic police officer was very courteous, but Zhu Tianlei's treatment was at a critical juncture, and any interruption would result in failure. Therefore, he remained silent, continuing acupuncture while guiding spiritual energy through the silver needles into Li Xu's body.</p><p>"Haven't you heard, if you don't cooperate, we'll have to enforce it!"</p><p>The traffic police repeated again, but Zhu Tianlei still showed no response.</p><p>"Officer, we can't afford any more delays. The optimal treatment window has already been missed. Please pull this person away from the vehicle!"</p><p>The traffic police's eyes flickered with uncertainty. For some reason, Zhu Tianlei's serious expression made him feel that the other man was indeed a doctor, and probably a skilled one.</p><p>"Officer, this man is acting strangely; he doesn't seem to know this individual, but he rushed over immediately after the car crash. I believe there's a high chance he's related to it!"</p><p>The car driver also approached and reported to the traffic police while looking at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>After some hesitation, the traffic police decided to pull Zhu Tianlei away. Lives were at stake, and he couldn't rely solely on his instincts for judgment.</p><p>"Alright, his condition is now stable. You can take him to the hospital for further treatment!"</p><p>Before the traffic police could touch Zhu Tianlei, he stood up first.</p><p>"Don't move those silver needles from his body yet. We must wait until his condition is completely stable before removing them; otherwise, there's a high risk of another massive intracranial hemorrhage!"</p><p>After all this commotion, Zhu Tianlei had expended a lot of spiritual energy, but fortunately, Li Xu's life was saved!</p><p>"Hmph, acting like he's a god among doctors! As if he really thinks he's a miracle healer!"</p><p>Watching Zhu Tianlei leave, the female doctor approached and muttered something under her breath.</p><p>The male doctor's expression was peculiar, though only briefly. He bent down to pick up a business card from the ground—it was the one that had fallen off Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>In just an instant, the female doctor pulled out the silver needles from Li Xu's body with a swift motion. Blood foam immediately gushed from his mouth in a fountain-like stream.</p><p>The doctor's face changed, and she seemed somewhat at a loss.</p><p>"Quick, get her on the stretcher and rush her to the emergency center."</p><p>The male doctor reacted faster. Without much thought, he called the two orderlies who were waiting in the ambulance to quickly lift Li Xu onto the stretcher and into the ambulance.</p><p>At the emergency center.</p><p>"The patient's liver, spleen, and kidneys have all been severely injured. There are three bleeding points on the liver, one large and two smaller ones, and there is also internal bleeding in the skull, but it seems to have stopped. Why are there signs of secondary injuries?"</p><p>Director Ke came out with a CT scan and said to his two students who had just participated in the emergency care.</p><p>Huo Ping's face turned ashen upon hearing this!</p><p>The teacher's words were almost identical to what that man had said earlier, but the teacher had conducted a CT scan, while that man had only glanced at her.</p><p>Moreover, secondary injuries—could it be......</p><p>"Xue Ping, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"</p><p>"Teacher, I......."</p><p>Huo Ping buried her head in her chest; she did not know how to start.</p><p>At this moment,</p><p>"Director Ke, something is wrong. The patient has gone into shock, the bleeding points have suddenly expanded, and the blood pressure has dropped to 40, with a blood loss of 3000cc……"</p><p>"Quick, contact the blood bank and urgently dispatch plasma to the emergency center."</p><p>Director Ke was anxious and could not afford to think about the previous issues; he hurriedly ordered his assistant to contact the blood bank.</p><p>"Director, the patient is Rh-negative blood type, and there's no such blood in the blood bank!"</p><p>......</p>

						<p>"Zhen Lei!!!"</p><p>In Zhen Lei's hand was a silver needle. Li Dacui, unable to believe what she was seeing, moved slightly, and her shoulder and tongue regained sensation. Just as Ruan Tianlei had stood up, he swayed and nearly fell down.</p><p>Ma Lanlan screamed in alarm, her heart pounding so hard it felt like it might burst out of her chest. She almost crawled over to Zhen Lei's side, disregarding any thoughts of reputation, and wrapped her arms around him.</p><p>Yao Gang and the villagers were also stunned, not understanding why their pillar of stability suddenly looked so grim.</p><p>Seeing their daughter hugging Ruan Tianlei, Ma Lanlan's parents had a rather displeased expression on their faces. However, they didn't say much at the moment, though they felt extremely uncomfortable inside.</p><p>"He is temporarily out of danger. After returning home, feed him some gruel daily to maintain his vital organs' functions. I will hurry up and prepare the medicine!"</p><p>Zhen Lei casually tossed out a sentence, then lowered his head to look at Ma Lanlan, who was tightly clinging to him, revealing a sinister smile.</p><p>Li Dacui sat dazed on the ground, watching Zhen Lei walk into the clinic with his back turned. She looked at the shattered glass of the clinic she had personally smashed and then glanced at her husband lying on the cart, breathing more evenly now.</p><p>A stream of tears mixed with shame and regret slid down her cheeks. Suddenly, she stood up and fell to her knees, banging her head against the ground towards the direction of the clinic.</p><p>Getting up, she grabbed the handle of the cart and pushed it away without looking back.</p><p>The bystanders watched Ma Lanlan's retreating figure, reflecting on what had just happened, feeling a mix of emotions. Their views of Zhen Lei had also changed somewhat.</p><p>This incident would likely become one of the annual events in Hamaogou Village.</p><p>In the clinic, Ma Lanlan gazed at Zhen Lei's pale face with concern, feeling a knot in her heart.</p><p>"Stupid girl, I'm not dead yet. Why are you making such a long face?"</p><p>"Pfft pfft pfft, You just talk nonsense all day. Don't say things like whether I'm alive or dead."</p><p>Hearing the word 'dead' from Zhen Lei made Ma Lanlan feel her heart racing, though she herself hadn't realized that her feelings for Zhen Lei were no longer simply a matter of liking him.</p><p>"Heh heh, are you afraid of being a widower?"</p><p>Ma Lanlan looked at Zhu Tianlei with eyes wide in anger, but for some reason, she couldn't help but laugh, emitting a snort.</p><p>This Zhu Tianlei, whose heart was clearly kind, had to insist on looking so slick and pretentious.</p><p>The two of them continued bantering in the clinic for a while. Then Village Head Yao Gang arrived with people to replace the glass at the clinic. After what had just happened, Yao Gang held Zhu Tianlei in even higher regard, his courteous manner making Zhu Tianlei's skin prickle with discomfort.</p><p>Neither Zhu Tianlei nor Ma Lanlan, nor any other villager had expected that on the day after the medical disturbance, four more people in the village would fall ill, exhibiting symptoms identical to those of Hu Zi and Qu Chuan.</p><p>Two days later, two neighboring villages also reported cases of this illness.</p><p>"Tianlei, it's already the seventeenth case!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan held a medical record in her hand, her tone filled with worry and helplessness. In just two days, Ma Lanlan's originally plump face had thinned to a pointy chin, making her eyes appear even larger.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's condition wasn't much better than Ma Lanlan's. Due to overexertion of his spiritual energy, his body had become slightly weak. On the scorching day of late August, he wore a long-sleeved shirt.</p><p>"Yes, it's the seventeenth case!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's tone was calm, showing no discernible emotion, but Ma Lanlan understood how he felt.</p><p>In Hamagou now, people were in a state of panic, everyone fearing for their safety. Rumors even spread that someone in Hamagou village had offended the mountain god, leading to this divine punishment.</p><p>The power of feudal superstition was terrifying in rural areas. Once it took root, it would quickly become an unstoppable wildfire.</p><p>Through the window, Zhu Tianlei stared at the distant Qingshange Mountain with a dazed expression.</p><p>"Lanlan, I'm going out for a while. I won't be back for lunch!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan nodded, although she was worried, she knew that Zhu Tianlei had been under immense pressure these two days and could use some time to relax.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei followed the small path opposite the clinic, crossed through the sorghum field, and kept walking toward Dahuangshan.</p><p>This sorghum field was the same one that Aunt Chen had crossed previously; it belonged to Zhu Changfa, a wealthy landowner in the village.</p><p>Zhu Changfa was Zhu Tianlei's uncle, but Zhu Tianlei had never even tasted a piece of candy from this uncle, let alone anything else throughout his life.</p><p>The name Heihu Forest is said to have originated from the early days of liberation when black leopards were reportedly spotted in the woods. The government organized special teams to hunt them down but returned empty-handed every time.</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Tianlei stood at the edge of Heihu Forest, feeling the mountain breeze pass through the trees, and his originally tense mood surprisingly eased.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei entered Hulu Cave, nearly an hour had passed.</p><p>This time, he knew exactly where to find the large boulder he had practiced on previously. He sat cross-legged, calmed his mind, and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>Just as last time, as time passed, the qi ball in his dantian became full again, emitting a strong heat that seeped into his bloodstream and circulated throughout his body.</p><p>The cold air that had twisted out of the patients' bodies was gradually dispelled by this heat. Zhu Tianlei sighed contentedly.</p><p>In his mind, the book Lingyi Xianshu suddenly reappeared. Zhu Tianlei found that this magical book seemed like an inexhaustible treasure; every time he thought he had fully understood it, he would gain new insights and understandings.</p><p>After a session of practice, Zhu Tianlei felt not only physical recovery but also a more abundant supply of spiritual energy in his body.</p><p>A faint layer of glowing white gas hovered around his palms.</p><p>"Hulu Cave truly lives up to its name as a divine abode and treasure land. It seems I should come here to practice regularly," Zhu Tianlei muttered to himself before stepping out of Hulu Cave. Afterward, instead of descending the mountain, he headed toward where he had found Zihua grass last time.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had experienced the miraculous effects of Zihua grass. Without the Zihua pills, his internal spiritual energy alone might not have been enough to control those patients' conditions.</p><p>But, he had wandered around Black Tiger Forest and Dahuangshan for several consecutive days without spotting any trace of Zihua grass. All he could do was hope to try his luck again, perhaps the Zihua grass had strong reproductive capabilities and had grown back!</p><p>"Ah! Help!"</p>

						<p>Seeing Min Shengjun collapse, Li Xu was immediately flustered. Upon seeing Zhu Tianlei remain motionless, he anxiously shouted, </p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, hurry up! Mr. Min has hypertension and his heart is not in good condition. You... I beg you, I beg you, please forgive me for my past mistakes. I didn’t recognize your worth before; I apologize to you. Please save Mr. Min quickly!"</p><p>As Li Xu spoke, tears began streaming down his face, and he was even about to kneel before Zhu Tianlei. Zhu Tianlei quickly lifted his foot and lightly tapped on Li Xu’s knee, stopping him.</p><p>"Save it, I’m afraid it’ll shorten my lifespan!"</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei squatted down, placing his hand on Min Shengjun’s wrist. He couldn’t help but be startled; the pulse of Min Shengjun was a clear sign of an extremely severe illness!</p><p>All medical practitioners share one common interest: they are fascinated by difficult and complex cases.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was no exception!</p><p>He retracted his hand and quickly took out silver needles from his pocket, inserting them into seventeen acupuncture points on Min Shengjun’s body. The angle at which the needles were inserted was slightly tilted, with their tips barely piercing through the skin.</p><p>Then, he took a pill he had made over the past two days, the ‘Runching Pill,’ and placed it in Min Shengjun’s mouth.</p><p>With his palm facing downward, he directed his energy to Min Shengjun’s chest, allowing the spiritual energy within him to slowly enter Min Shengjun’s body.</p><p>This time, he was pleasantly surprised to find that his spiritual energy seemed more abundant than before. Despite continuously releasing energy from his body, the qi ball in his dantian became increasingly full.</p><p>Li Xu stood beside them, unable to imagine what he would do if Min Shengjun were to pass away because of this incident.</p><p>"Cough... cough..."</p><p>Several minutes later, Min Shengjun slowly opened his eyes, seeing Zhu Tianlei’s magnified face before him.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>He moved his body slightly and suddenly exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>The knot that had been lingering in his chest for so long finally vanished. He greedily took several deep breaths, feeling incredibly refreshed. For years, he had never breathed so smoothly.</p><p>What on earth was happening?</p><p>"Mr. Min, you're awake?"</p><p>Li Xu wiped his eyes in excitement, thanking heaven and earth!</p><p>"Young man, were these needles inserted by you?"</p><p>Min Shengjun did not answer Li Xu but instead looked at the silver needles on his body.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>When Min Shengjun was unconscious, Zhu Tianlei had been somewhat worried. Now that Min Shengjun had opened his eyes, the previous unpleasantness quickly resurfaced in Zhu Tianlei's mind.</p><p>"Young man, thank you! This illness has tormented me for several years. I always thought my remaining days would be spent like this, barely breathing and possibly dying at any moment. I never expected...... young man, what great medical skills!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not speak; he simply lowered his head and carefully removed the silver needles from Min Shengjun's body, neatly placing them back into his own needle bag.</p><p>Min Shengjun did not feel embarrassed either. After just now, he had figured out the truth of the matter, which also explained why the young man was angry.</p><p>"Li Xu, what did I tell you?"</p><p>"Mr. Min, I'm sorry. It was my own initiative. I got too anxious; nothing happened in a year, so I acted on impulse and did that thing. I am willing to accept any punishment from the company, whatever it may be!"</p><p>Li Xu lowered his head with an extremely respectful attitude, completely different from before.</p><p>"Young man, regardless of what happens, this is my Shengshi Group's fault. To tell you the truth, when I was young, I once worked as a commune member in Toad Ditch and had deep feelings for it. Most of the older villagers there knew me."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was stunned. He did not expect such a subplot to be involved.</p><p>"You...... Are you Hammer Brother?"</p><p>Suddenly, Yao Gang, who had been silent all along, rushed out and stared at General Min Shengjun with his mouth agape.</p><p>"Are you......"</p><p>"Hammer Brother, I'm Yao Gang, Little Ganger!"</p><p>"What? You're Little Ganger? I remember back then you were wearing bell-bottom pants, and in a blink of an eye......"</p><p>Min Shengjun's eyes immediately welled up with tears. It had been almost 40 years since then; the little boy who used to wear bell-bottom pants was now in his mid-forties. Time really flies!</p><p>Yao Gang was also extremely excited. When Min Shengjun went to the countryside, he was just seventeen or eighteen. He often told them stories and jokes during their idle times, and when Min Shengjun returned to the city, Yao Gang even cried for a long time.</p><p>He never thought that after all these years, they would reunite in such a way.</p><p>Looking at the scene before him, Zhu Tianlei was also somewhat dazed. What's going on? They were clearly about to come and demand justice with tense expressions, but now it had turned into a family reunion?</p><p>"Little Ganger, this young man is......"</p><p>"Oh oh, he's called Zhu Tianlei, our village doctor. He has amazing medical skills, bringing people back from the brink of death, and his martial arts are also excellent; he can handle ten or more people without a problem."</p><p>Just mentioning Zhu Tianlei made Yao Gang feel proud from the bottom of his heart. This was their treasure from Hamagou Village!</p><p>"Haha, I didn't expect our village's young generation to be so impressive!"</p><p>Min Shengjun laughed loudly, genuinely looking happy.</p><p>But Zhu Tianlei inexplicably felt something strange; this plot twist was happening too fast!</p><p>"Tianlei, what happened earlier was my uncle Min's mistake. I'll definitely go to the village personally later and apologize to everyone."</p><p>Seeing Min Shengjun's attitude so sincere, Zhu Tianlei felt that if he were to keep dwelling on it, he would seem petty.</p><p>"Since it was a misunderstanding, General Min doesn't need to worry about it. It's fine as long as the misunderstanding is cleared up! Just remember, General Min, be more careful when hiring people in the future!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shot Li Xu a pointed look; this time, Li Xu's expression remained calm, even giving Zhu Tianlei a faint smile.</p><p>"Alright, Xiaogangzi, Tianlei, come on, let's go to my office and have a proper chat!"</p><p>Seeing his former acquaintance, Min Shengjun was so excited that he could barely control himself. Without waiting for the two of them to agree, he pushed them out of the room directly.</p><p>"Tianlei, your medical skills are so impressive; why don't you come to the city? Uncle Min will invest and let you open a private hospital."</p><p>After chatting for a while, Min Shengjun suddenly said.</p><p>"Uncle Min, I don't want to leave Hagaogou right now. If I do want to do something, I want to do it in Hagaogou, and ideally, I'd like to work with the villagers together!"</p><p>"That's great! Do you have any plans?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei originally wanted to say that he wanted to open a pharmaceutical factory, but then he thought they might think he had ulterior motives, so he shook his head.</p><p>"Not yet!"</p><p>"It's fine. Young people having ideas is what matters. Uncle Min started out with just a saw and a plane, working hard step by step until today. If you come up with any plans, just tell Uncle Min; I fully support you!"</p><p>Seeing Min Shengjun's sincere expression, Zhu Tianlei finally dispelled his prejudice against him.</p><p>"Oh right, Xiaogangzi, how are the sick villagers doing now?"</p><p>Min Shengjun had already learned all about what happened in detail earlier and felt deeply guilty. He was afraid that if he went to them directly, they might be unwilling to accept the compensation, so he made Li Xu go instead.</p><p>He repeatedly emphasized patience and instructed not to have any conflicts with the villagers. However, things hadn't gone as planned. If anything were to happen to those villagers, how could Min Shengjun feel at peace for the rest of his life?</p><p>"Thanks to Tianlei, everyone has recovered and is fine now!"</p><p>"Tianlei, Uncle Min thanks you. If not for you, Uncle Min would have become a scapegoat in Hamagou, unable to hold his head up for the rest of his life. Thank you!"</p><p>"Don't be like that, Uncle Min. Forget about this matter. Thankfully, everything is fine now. Let it go, and we won't mention it again in the future!"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei's modest and courteous demeanor, Meng Shengjun's impression of him only grew better.</p><p>"Tianlei, this is a small token of my gratitude from Uncle Min. Please accept it!"</p><p>Suddenly, Meng Shengjun pulled out an envelope from his drawer. The envelope was tiny and thin.</p><p>"Uncle Min, what are you doing? There's no way I can take this!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei waved his hand.</p><p>"Tianlei, this is a small token of gratitude from Mr. Meng. Please accept it. You cured Mr. Meng's illness, which made him happier than anything else. Please accept it quickly!"</p><p>"Yes, Tianlei, it's just a token of our appreciation!"</p><p>Meng Shengjun and Yao Gang both tried to persuade Zhu Tianlei. Seeing that the envelope was indeed small, Zhu Tianlei hesitated for a moment before taking it. Meng Shengjun then nodded with a smile.</p><p>The three of them engaged in deep conversation until sunset. Yao Gang and Zhu Tianlei only got up to head back to the village when the sun had set.</p><p>Meng Shengjun insisted they not leave and dragged them along for dinner. Unable to convince him otherwise, they called home and ended up eating and drinking with Meng Shengjun until past ten o'clock.</p><p>After dropping off the two at the hotel, Meng Shengjun went back home. Yao Gang fell asleep as soon as he entered the hotel due to his intoxication. On the other hand, Zhu Tianlei, who had consumed a liter of baijiu, showed no signs of intoxication and instead tossed and turned in bed, unable to fall asleep.</p><p>Reaching into his clothes, he found the envelope and opened it, discovering that it contained a bank card.</p><p>The password was written on the back of the card.</p><p>By chance, Zhu Tianlei got up and walked out of the hotel. After wandering around on the streets for a while, he found a bank and entered the password written on the card. Soon, a string of numbers appeared on the ATM screen.</p><p>"Units, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands......."</p>

						<p>After confirming that Kong Shengbin was safe, Zhu Tianlei slowly got up, gently covering him with the blanket, and turned around to see Xue Ping and the others looking worried. He couldn't help but smile guiltily.</p><p>Due to the large consumption of spiritual energy, Zhu Tianlei went to bed earlier than usual.</p><p>Now, his cultivation no longer required him to sit down and meditate as it used to; he could practice while sleeping.</p><p>Over time, Zhu Tianlei's cultivation seemed to have reached a new level, but it had to be said that the effectiveness of practicing elsewhere was greatly reduced compared to in the gourd cave.</p><p>Although he went to bed early, Zhu Tianlei woke up just after midnight.</p><p>The night outside was like water, and the entire quarantine zone looked like a sunken Atlantis beneath the sea, completely still without a hint of life.</p><p>A shadow of death loomed over this place isolated from the normal world.</p><p>In October, the night air was already chilly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei put on a coat and walked out of his room.</p><p>The corridor lights were dim. To maintain air circulation, even at midnight, the windows in the ward corridors were open, and the night wind blew the electric lights back and forth, casting flickering shadows.</p><p>A nurse on duty leaned against her chair with her eyes closed.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei approached and gently draped a coat from a nearby hanger over the nurse's shoulders.</p><p>At that moment, an unusual sound came from one of the wards at the end of the corridor.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was startled.</p><p>In recent days, his mind had been constantly on edge. Even the slightest noise made him feel tense.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei quickened his pace along the corridor toward the direction of the sound.</p><p>"1209."</p><p>The patient in this room is called Wu Xiaohui, a young woman who is very beautiful, although she has tattoos on her shoulders and chest. Since the day she entered the isolation zone, she has been wearing a crop top that exposes her midriff.</p><p>Her face was heavily made up, with bright red lips, exaggerated eyelashes, and a large expanse of bare skin exposed on her chest, all of which made Zhu Tianlei keep his distance from this woman.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had once commissioned Zhao Xin to politely tell Wu Xiaohui not to wear makeup or overly revealing clothing during treatment; she should wear the standard hospital gown. However, not only did Wu Xiaohui ignore Zhao Xin's advice, but she also lectured him on the absurd notion that a woman should always be beautiful and elegant under any circumstances.</p><p>Standing at the door, the sounds inside the room were clear.</p><p>Apart from Wu Xiaohui, there was even a man’s voice.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was no longer an inexperienced youth; he was very familiar with such noises coming from within the room.</p><p>However, this was a ward, and Wu Xiaohui was a patient. Could she not understand that her body was extremely weak at this time and that her immune system was virtually nonexistent?</p><p>If it were under normal circumstances, Zhu Tianlei would have ignored it; he had no interest in male-female romances. But now, since the other party was his patient and he was her doctor, he had to stop such activities.</p><p>Thinking of this, Zhu Tianlei stood outside the door and coughed loudly twice.</p><p>The sounds inside the room immediately stopped.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt somewhat relieved; it seemed that Wu Xiaohui had not yet reached a point of no return.</p><p>"Quick... hurry up..."</p><p>However, Zhu Tianlei was too optimistic. Before he could move away, the sounds from within the room started again, and this time they were much louder.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but shake his head at this woman, Wu Xiaohui.</p><p>"Tuk tuk tuk!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei simply reached out and knocked on the door.</p><p>He didn’t believe that Wu Xiaohui would be shameless enough to continue what she was doing even after someone knocked on the door.</p><p>"F*ck, who is knocking on my door in the middle of the night, disrupting me from getting things done!"</p><p>Curses could be heard from inside the room, followed by the sound of the door opening. Wu Xiaohui appeared before Zhu Tianlei, wrapped only in a sheet.</p><p>Do not look at inappropriate sights.</p><p>This was the minimum quality Zhu Tianlei expected from a man.</p><p>However, Wu Xiaohui’s sheet barely covered her key areas, and even that was incomplete.</p><p>Half of her snow-white skin was exposed, as were the edges of her thighs, with hints of a jungle visible.</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei had experienced the taste of women and his own women were all top-tier beauties, it was still normal for any man to have a physical reaction seeing such a woman in the middle of the night.</p><p>"Oh, Dr. Zhu, I thought it might be someone else. Is Dr. Zhu not sleeping at this hour because you’re thinking about a woman?"</p><p>Seeing that the person standing at the door was Zhu Tianlei, Wu Xiaohui curled her lips into a smile, casting flirtatious glances his way as she leaned against the door frame and inadvertently lowered the sheet.</p><p>"Wu Xiaohui, you are a patient and need adequate rest. Also, this is a hospital, a public place; be more careful!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei’s green eyes shifted in embarrassment, and he said dryly, "Hehe, your face turned red. Dr. Zhu isn’t still an inexperienced virgin, is he? Why don’t I help you break in, taste the flavor of women?"</p><p>Hearing Wu Xiaohui becoming increasingly inappropriate, Zhu Tianlei’s expression darkened.</p><p>"If you want to live and leave the isolation area, you need to cooperate with the doctor's treatment. If you keep being so careless about your health, and something really happens, where will you cry if you want to?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei considered himself to be a gentle and gentlemanly person when it came to dealing with women, but in the presence of Wu Xiaohui, he could not help but feel annoyed.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, I am a woman. Having needs in that area is normal, isn't it? Moreover, what if I were to close my eyes one day and meet King Yan directly, wouldn't it be a pity to die without having enjoyed life?"</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Seeing Wu Xiaohui flipping her hair and posing provocatively, Zhu Tianlei was momentarily at a loss for words.</p><p>"Who is in the room? Come out!"</p><p>Unable to yell at a woman, Zhu Tianlei shouted towards the room instead.</p><p>To prevent cross-infection, all the wards in the isolation area were single occupancy, so this man could not be from this room.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, this is an isolation area, not a crackdown on prostitution and illegal publications. Don't you think you're overstepping?"</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei shout into the room, Wu Xiaohui's tone immediately changed.</p><p>"A man, come out."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei ignored Wu Xiaohui's attitude.</p><p>A moment later, a man scratched his head and walked out from behind Wu Xiaohui.</p><p>"Wang Hao?"</p><p>Seeing the man behind her, Zhu Tianlei was stunned.</p><p>Wang Hao was a sophomore student with an introverted and shy personality. He rarely spoke, and every time Zhu Tianlei examined him, Wang Hao would be bashful like a little girl.</p><p>He never could have imagined that the person coming out of Wu Xiaohui's room would be Wang Hao.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu......I......"</p><p>Wang Hao lowered his head, his face turning as red as liver. Facing Zhu Tianlei, he didn't know what to say. Before Zhu Tianlei could speak, Wang Hao lifted his foot and was about to leave.</p><p>"Hold it, hold it, you haven't paid yet!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stared wide-eyed at Wu Xiaohui.</p><p>"Just transfer the money, WeChat or Alipay is fine!"</p><p>Seeing Wang Hao trying to leave in a hurry, Wu Xiaohui shouted shrilly, her voice echoing through the empty corridor.</p>

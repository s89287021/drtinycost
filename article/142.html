						<p>"Damn, what kind of beast would do such a thing to a child......"</p><p>"Yes, I told you, Zhu Tianlei's medical skills are so high that he can even bring the dead back to life. How could he possibly kill someone......."</p><p>"You're right, maybe these people are just like those before them, trying to frame Tianlei. They really have no shame at all......"</p><p>The people who were previously discussing the matter started whispering among themselves again.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, y-y-you......."</p><p>The oily man felt like he should say something, but after hesitating for a while, he still couldn't figure out what to say.</p><p>Old Liu's heart had already turned cold and shrunk into the corner, almost about to collide with the wall when the change in circumstances made his eyes shine again, and he straightened up immediately.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the unconscious woman without making any move.</p><p>He was wondering why this woman would frame him?</p><p>He knew how much she cared about her child, which didn't seem like an act, but he had no grievances with her. On the contrary, he even saved her child.</p><p>Twenty minutes later.</p><p>Several cars sped up.</p><p>Leading them was precisely Huang Hai.</p><p>"Director Huang?"</p><p>Seeing Huang Hai's worried and weary face, his eyes widened in surprise, almost falling out of his sockets.</p><p>After Huang Hai Sheng became the director, he was only responsible for reviewing the programs and controlling the ratings; he would never appear on-site anymore. But now...</p><p>"General Zhu, I brought over a forensic doctor from the municipal bureau. I hope this can be of assistance to you."</p><p>He said "assistance," not anything else.</p><p>The word "assistance" conveyed so much meaning. Following that, a woman in a police uniform walked up and nodded at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>The oily man watched the forensic doctor approach with eager eyes, wanting to stop her but was pulled back by someone behind him.</p><p>The person pulling him was his younger brother, the same little yellow-haired one who had brought over the banner earlier. At this point, the oily man knew that all was lost and could only reluctantly step back.</p><p>"The infant girl is estimated to be 3-5 months old, died within 10-12 hours, cause of death being traumatic injury causing internal organ rupture, organ failure, blunt force trauma to the back of the head, initial diagnosis indicating skull fracture and cerebral hemorrhage."</p><p>The forensic doctor's findings caused a hush over the entire room because half an hour earlier, Zhu Tianlei had said almost the same thing.</p><p>Soon after, doctors from the hospital arrived with a portable CT machine.</p><p>"After examination, there were three broken ribs in the victim, pulmonary congestion, right hepatic lobe rupture, and a blood clot of 3.5*2.4cm diameter inside the skull."</p><p>The oily man's mouth was agape, his back teeth clearly visible.</p><p>He stared at Zhu Tianlei in disbelief—what kind of person was this? He could be certain that Zhu Tianlei had never come into contact with the infant's corpse before.</p><p>"Amazing! Truly amazing!"</p><p>After the silence,</p><p>the atmosphere erupted with praise, applause echoing like a landslide or tidal wave.</p><p>Everyone watching on TV or listening to the radio simultaneously gasped in shock.</p><p>Everyone has a doubt in their heart: Who is Zhu Tianlei, exactly?</p><p>"General Zhu, how are you planning to handle this matter?"</p><p>Although he had already witnessed Zhu Tianlei's miracles before, Huang Hai could not help but feel shocked and awed once again upon experiencing it yet again.</p><p>In the previous fake drug scandal, Zhu Tianlei not only became famous overnight but also gained an advantage in the TV station's election, ultimately securing the position of director at a young age. This achievement he had to attribute to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>However, Huang Hai quickly regained his composure. Although he did not inquire, his sensitivity allowed him to guess the situation almost immediately, so he asked Zhu Tianlei,</p><p>"I think this matter doesn't require my own decision; with your media's reporting, someone will take it upon themselves to resolve it."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said calmly.</p><p>Huang Hai was taken aback and then burst into laughter. Zhu Tianlei truly had a great sense of calm.</p><p>However, he was right. Any matter, once publicized by the media, would be amplified many times over, often turning from a personal issue into a societal problem.</p><p>Seeing that things had reached this point, the oily man realized there was no way to salvage the situation and glanced around before sneaking away with his younger brother and other associates.</p><p>"Don't let these bad guys get away!"</p><p>Before Zhu Tianlei could speak, someone in the crowd noticed the oily man's actions and shouted loudly, immediately arousing everyone's emotions.</p><p>A group of people surrounded the oily man and his companions. It was unclear who initiated it first, but soon, fists and feet were raining down on them like a storm.</p><p>...</p><p>In the end, it was the police from Dahuai County who arrived to stop the crowd's actions.</p><p>The oily man and the other seven individuals had been beaten to such an extent that they were barely recognizable, their faces bruised and swollen.</p><p>Various media outlets still wanted to conduct further follow-up interviews, but all were politely declined by Zhu Tianlei. In the end, only Huang Hai and people from Yunhai Minsheng stayed behind.</p><p>The infant's body was taken away by officers from the Public Security Bureau.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei used his spiritual energy to revive the fainting woman. The woman glanced at Zhu Tianlei and then quickly lowered her head, never raising it again.</p><p>Standing at the door, Zhu Tianlei watched as the infant's body was loaded into a vehicle. He vaguely recalled the feeling of this small life wriggling in his arms.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei brought Huang Hai and the others into the company.</p><p>Lao Liu stood by the entrance, angrily glaring at the banner hanging above him. His frustration seemed to have no outlet, so he looked around for a while before finding a bamboo pole, sweeping the banner off the ground with it, and then stomping on it forcefully. However, this did not seem to satisfy his anger, so he dug out a lighter and set the banner ablaze.</p><p>The red flames danced in the mountain wind, as if burning away all of Lao Liu's gloom and fear.</p><p>In Huang Hai and Zhu Tianlei's office.</p><p>"Congratulations, Director Huang, on your promotion!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Huang Hai and said with a faint smile.</p><p>"It was all thanks to General Manager Zhu. If not for that episode of the show, it would have been impossible for me to be promoted to director."</p><p>Huang Hai was a very sincere person, and this trait naturally brought him close to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"May I ask Director Huang for a small favor..."</p><p>...</p><p>An hour later, Huang Hai left with the people from Yunhai Minsheng's program team.</p><p>No one knew what Huang Hai and Zhu Tianlei had talked about during that hour, but Li Xiang understood one thing: the relationship between Zhu Tianlei and Huang Hai was extraordinary.</p><p>There was still one thing: she realized her inadequacy as a journalist, her preconceived notions and biases, which were obstacles to becoming an outstanding news worker. </p><p>The matter was left behind.</p><p>Apart from the few women who later criticized, educated, and showed concern for Zhu Tianlei separately,</p><p>Life returned to normal.</p><p>The only difference was that the telephone at Tianlei Pharmaceutical's marketing department became busier than a mobile company hotline.</p><p>And many of these calls made the receptionist feel helpless, unsure how to respond.</p><p>"Tianlei, sure thing! It seems our Tianlei Pharmaceutical's marketing department has turned into a dating agency; there are so many uncles and aunties, hot beauties and pretty girls calling every day that you can't even count them all!"</p><p>Mao Yu looked at Zhu Tianlei and teased.</p>

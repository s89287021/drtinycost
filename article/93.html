						<p>Zhu Tianlei's words were not only directed at Fang Yun but also at the bodyguards lying on the ground.</p><p>"Humph, Zhu, you are being rather arrogant too early, aren't you?"</p><p>Only when Zhu Tianlei turned around did he realize that his mother, who had been standing in the room, had somehow been dragged out from a small path beside the house by someone.</p><p>In rural areas, houses were typically built facing south with courtyards right in front of them and gates on both sides. It didn't take much imagination to guess that this person must have entered through the back door.</p><p>"Tianlei..."</p><p>Hou Suqin's face was ashen; she had no idea what was happening. Her son, who had recently become a celebrity throughout the nearby villages and even half of Yunhai City, with people constantly coming to express gratitude and visit him, now faced this situation.</p><p>Seeing his mother shaking in fear, Zhu Tianlei's anger flared up instantly.</p><p>He could tolerate almost anything, but he could not bear anyone harming his parents. They were his vulnerability, his Achilles' heel, and his bottom line.</p><p>"Let go of my mom!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's voice was calm, but those familiar with him knew what it meant.</p><p>"Let go? Humph, aren't you mighty? You don't seem to think much of our boss or even County Magistrate Yang. Do you have the guts to act tough again? The old lady is in my hands now. If you want to save Xiao Brother, show some sense and get him treated immediately. Apologize to your sister-in-law and our boss too, otherwise..."</p><p>"Zhu, it is said that those who know when to bend are wise. We don't want to make things difficult for you. Cure Mingzhe, and we'll forget this ever happened."</p><p>Fang Yun still had some sense; he knew that pushing things too far was not a good idea. After all, as the saying goes, cornered rabbits can bite.</p><p>"I will say it one more time: let go of my mom!"</p><p>This time, Zhu Tianlei's voice was even lower and more menacing.</p><p>Li Xiaoli, with both hands supporting Hou Suqin's armpits, paid no heed to Zhu Tianlei's words. Having spent years mingling in society alongside his elder brother, he had seen and experienced it all. He could tell at a glance that Zhu Tianlei was an obedient son who cared deeply for his mother; the more he cared, the less likely he was to take action lightly. That was why Li Xiaoli took advantage of the moment when no one was paying attention and snuck around to the back door, slipping into the house.</p><p>"Mr. Zhu, my sister just made it very clear that if you cure my brother's illness, I'll release your mother. Otherwise, if anything happens to her, you won't have a place to cry!"</p><p>Li Xiaoli felt confident, so his tone was brash.</p><p>Hou Suqin's calves cramped up suddenly, and her body became incredibly weak. Her heart pounded so hard that it seemed ready to burst out of her chest. However, she dared not open her mouth easily; if her son refused to treat that person, there must be a reason. She could not burden her son further even if she was unable to help him.</p><p>Mothers know their children best; how could Zhu Tianlei not understand what his mother was thinking? Therefore, he did not want to waste any more words.</p><p>One does not provoke me, and I do not provoke one; but if one provokes me, I will destroy the root of the matter. "Then don't blame me for being ruthless!"</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Before Li Xiaoli could fully process Zhu Tianlei's words, a dark shadow flashed in front of his eyes. His arms went numb instantly, and the two arms that were supporting Hou Suqin lost their strength.</p><p>Hou Suqin managed to escape, but this was far from over.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei reached out to shield Hou Suqin behind him, forming lotus hand seals with both hands. With a few slaps, Li Xiaoli's shoulder, arm, and calves were struck as if by lightning, rendering him unable to stand. He fell to the ground with a thud.</p><p>Fang Yun instinctively took a step back.</p><p>She somewhat regretted her actions today.</p><p>Wasn't he just a barefoot doctor from a village? How could he possess such skill?</p><p>The speed and ruthlessness of his attack were truly terrifying.</p><p>"Yoyoyo...... What are you going to do?"</p><p>Looking at Zhu Tianlei walking down the stairs, Fang Yun was so frightened that her voice trembled.</p><p>Although the security guards who had been knocked down had stood up, each of them was injured in varying degrees. However, this was not the most important thing; the most crucial point was that they all felt an inner fear towards Zhu Tianlei at that moment.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei walked down step by step, each step carrying a chilling aura, and Fang Yun was so frightened that she nearly fainted.</p><p>Standing in front of Fang Yun, Zhu Tianlei did not attack her but instead casually picked up a square concrete pillar from the ditch beside the garden.</p><p>This type of concrete pillar was poured with concrete for reinforcement and had steel bars inside to support the roof when erecting greenhouses.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei held the concrete pillar in his hand, glanced coldly at Fang Yun, and then swept a glance at the security guards standing around her before speaking in a low voice.</p><p>"If you dare to come to the door again, this will be your fate!"</p><p>With that said, he swung his palm down, severing the thigh-thick concrete pillar along with the steel bars inside in one swift motion.</p><p>Flesh and blood are vulnerable like knives and swords.</p><p>Fang Yun rolled her eyes and fainted on the spot.</p><p>"Carry this person away and get lost!"</p><p>The word "lost" echoed like thunder in the courtyard.</p><p>None of the security team led by Zhang Hua dared to say another word. No matter how stubborn their necks were, could they be tougher than that concrete pillar? They wanted to earn money, but they also needed to have their lives!</p><p>Almost before a blink, the courtyard became clean and silent.</p><p>"Mom, your son is unfilial and has caused you trouble!"</p><p>Turning to look at Hou Suqin, who was still in shock, Zhu Tianlei felt a deep sense of guilt and pain.</p><p>"Stupid child, what trouble can there be between you and your mother? It's you who provoked those people—won't they get into trouble?"</p><p>She had heard with her own ears that the woman was the county magistrate's wife.</p><p>The county magistrate is a big official. If he really wanted to do something nasty to his son, wouldn't it work every time?</p><p>"Mom, don't worry about me. Didn't you see just now? Even if there is trouble, it will be on their heads, not your son's!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words were not only a consolation but also reflected his true thoughts. He knew well that County Magistrate Yang and Xu Mingzhe would not give up easily.</p><p>Especially Xu Mingzhe, who was clearly conscious but had remained motionless on the stretcher with his eyes closed the entire time—such cunning could be described as unfathomable.</p><p>What happened in Zhu's courtyard quickly spread, and Zhu Tianlei's reputation in Hamagou Village was once again exaggerated.</p><p>After a brief cleanup, it was already three o'clock in the afternoon.</p><p>Thinking of Ma Lanlan still sulking at him, Zhu Tianlei sighed. No matter what, Lanlan's pouting was because she cared about him. With this thought, he felt much more at ease and walked briskly towards the clinic.</p><p>However, the clinic was still locked, and Ma Lanlan had not replied to his messages.</p><p>"Where is everyone?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was puzzled. Even if they were on a house call, it couldn't take half a day for them to return!</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was contemplating this without any answers, he heard hurried footsteps coming from behind.</p>

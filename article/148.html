						<p>Ma Lanlan hugged Zhu Tianlei tightly and tiptoed, her lips barely touching his in a rough kiss.</p><p>The spring rain falling on the parched earth was no different.</p><p>Despite all his doubts and confusion, being held so close by his beloved woman, kissed, even a man like Liu Xiaohui would be unable to hold back!</p><p>Therefore, Zhu Tianlei no longer hesitated; since this was his woman, it was something that should have been done long ago.</p><p>Taking the initiative.</p><p>A large hand carried an overwhelming power, hovering over the mountain tops.</p><p>Two majestic mountains stood tall, covered in a blanket of snow, within which two red plum blossoms bloomed proudly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's lips gently brushed against them, wanting to make these red plums bloom even more beautifully, so he kept pushing the mountain peaks. The continuous mountain range seemed to be submerged in the deep sea, creating ripples.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei lingered lovingly on top of the red plums, tasting and re-tasting them.</p><p>Then, the large hand leaped over the vast plains, galloping across, heading straight for the forested tundra.</p><p>The dense forests and deep gorges concealed trickling streams.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, like a traveler just returning from the desert, greedily lay by the edge of the stream, urgently wanting to drink more and more...</p><p>"Tianlei, want me, want me..."</p><p>Ma Lanlan's body was scorching hot, as if she wanted to burn herself and drag Zhu Tianlei into the flames too, fusing them together.</p><p>"Good Lanlan, I want it too, I'm coming..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's heart beat rapidly, almost jumping out of his chest.</p><p>He supported his own dragon head, looking at the ravine that had given him hope for rebirth, slowly entering.</p><p>"Ah, it hurts......."</p><p>"It'll be okay soon, very soon......"</p><p>A newly opened valley, untouched by anyone, remained in its most pristine state. Zhu Tianlei could not bear to ruthlessly destroy this natural beauty.</p><p>Gradually, the stream within the valley began to surge.</p><p>Ma Lanlan reached out and hugged Zhu Tianlei's neck as the snowy mountain approached the plain, and the red plum blossoms seemed eager to bloom on the plain.</p><p>With the flooding of the water, the dragon appeared to be endowed with a new kind of strength, winding and galloping through the stream.</p><p>"Tianlei, hurry up, hurry up......."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled faintly.</p><p>"Stinky brat, have you tasted it yet?"</p><p>Though he teased with his words, Zhu Tianlei cooperated wholeheartedly.</p><p>The moonlight fell upon the white sheet, where a large red rose flower bloomed.</p><p>After the wind stopped and the rain ceased.</p><p>The two of them still leaned against each other.</p><p>A satisfied smile appeared on Ma Lanlan's face.</p><p>"Stupid brat, why are you smiling so cunningly? Tell me, what happened, why were you in such a hurry?"</p><p>"Phew, you're the one in a hurry, weren't you? Just now, you were so comfortable."</p><p>Ma Lanlan was different from the other women; she had a straightforward personality and was quite feisty. Even after experiencing such an event, she showed no hint of embarrassment.</p><p>"Yes, yes, I was incredibly comfortable. Want to do it again?"</p><p>"Sure, who's afraid of whom?"</p><p>Puh!</p><p>Seeing Ma Lanlan's cute little nose scrunch up, Zhu Tianlei almost burst into laughter. However, this version of Ma Lanlan made him love her deeply from the heart.</p><p>Looking at Ma Lanlan's snowy hills, peaks, valleys, forests...</p><p>Zhu Tianlei gave a mischievous smile and really moved in.</p><p>"Tell me this time, what happened?"</p><p>After another brief pause, Zhu Tianlei spoke again.</p><p>"My mom introduced me to a matchmaker and told me to get married by the end of the year."</p><p>What?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sat up abruptly.</p><p>How could he allow his wife to meet with a matchmaker? No man would accept this.</p><p>"No way, I'll go talk to your parents right away..."</p><p>"Phew, you were the one in a hurry just now, weren’t you? You were so comfortable just then."</p><p>Ma Lanlan was different from the other women; she had a straightforward personality and was quite feisty. Even after going through such an experience, she showed no signs of embarrassment.</p><p>"Yes, yes, I was incredibly comfortable. Want to do it again?"</p><p>"Sure, who’s afraid of whom?"</p><p>Puh!</p><p>Seeing Ma Lanlan's cute little nose scrunch up, Zhu Tianlei almost burst into laughter. However, this version of Ma Lanlan made him love her deeply from the heart.</p><p>Looking at Ma Lanlan's snowy hills, peaks, valleys, forests...</p><p>Zhu Tianlei gave a mischievous smile and really moved in.</p><p>Although it was Ma Lanlan's first time experiencing such things, she was even more passionate than Zhu Tianlei. Her crazy responses and demands made him feel like he had experienced an unprecedented human feast.</p><p>"Tell me this time, what happened?"</p><p>After another brief pause, Zhu Tianlei spoke again.</p><p>"My mom introduced me to a matchmaker and told me to get married by the end of the year."</p><p>What?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sat up abruptly.</p><p>No way could he allow his wife to meet with a matchmaker. No man would accept this.</p><p>"No way, I'll go talk to your parents right away..."</p><p>"Phew, you were in such a hurry just now, weren't you?

No man would accept this.</p><p>"No way, I'll go talk to your parents right away..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was truly desperate, even more so than Ma Lanlan, to the point that he momentarily forgot he was still naked.</p><p>Ma Lanlan couldn't help but laugh at Zhu Tianlei's appearance.</p><p>"Idiot, don't worry. I can handle it. You really shouldn't go. If you do, my mom might kick you out."</p><p>Ma Lanlan wasn't exaggerating; last time the two of them hadn't done anything yet, Niao Fengyun had a cold look in her eyes that nearly made Zhu Tianlei suffer a painful death. If she knew about him and Ma Lanlan now, she would definitely want to kill him.</p><p>"I can't let you handle this alone. I'm a man; this matter shouldn't be left to a girl like you."</p><p>A young woman losing her virginity before finding a partner could be life-threatening in the countryside. He couldn't bear for his woman to be surrounded by rumors and gossip.</p><p>"Don't worry, I'm not stupid. How would I dare say it out loud? You can relax; I was just being impulsive earlier."</p><p>Ma Lanlan's personality was almost like a man's. She quickly got over it and started comforting Zhu Tianlei instead.</p><p>"That still won't do, I......"</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, stop being so indecisive! Are you even a man? I've already said everything is fine, why aren't you satisfied?"</p><p>Hearing that Zhu Tianlei was still ignoring her advice and insisted on solving the problem himself, Ma Lanlan's temper flared up.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pouted his lips.</p><p>"What, are you feeling wronged?"</p><p>Ma Lanlan sat casually on the bed, looking at the naked Zhu Tianlei as if he were the young wife.</p><p>"Don't you know I'm a man?"</p><p>Spit!</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei finish his sentence, Ma Lanlan immediately spat out. However, before she could open her mouth again, someone pushed her back onto the bed.</p><p>The next day, Ma Lanlan unexpectedly took a sick leave and did not go to the clinic for work.</p><p>Miao Fengyun stared suspiciously at her daughter several times, but Ma Lanlan simply said she had stomach pain. She could say nothing more, but as a mother, her intuition told her that her daughter was definitely hiding something from her.</p><p>Feeling an unprecedented sense of fulfillment, Zhu Tianlei slept in until midday.</p><p>Because her son had earned money, the family's living conditions improved, and Hou Suqin finally felt free to spend money on groceries.</p><p>Now, there were four dishes on the table: baked potato dried fish, steamed pork with taro, ginger stir-fried meat, and celery tofu dry goods.</p><p>This standard of living was almost unimaginable in the past.</p><p>With no shortage of money at home, Zhu Tianlei suggested that Uncle Zhiquzi and Grandma Zhiquzi stop farming and enjoy their lives at home, having endured hardships for half a lifetime.</p><p>However, both the old couple firmly refused. Zhu Tianlei did not insist but went along with their wishes.</p><p>Filial piety means following their hearts.</p><p>Sitting at the table, Zhu Tianlei lowered his head to eat and noticed that it seemed there were two hot glances continuously falling on him from across the table.</p><p>But when he looked up, he saw that the old couple was busy eating and did not pay attention to him.</p><p>Was it just an illusion?</p><p>In any case, Zhu Tianlei ate his meal very uncomfortably.</p><p>After dinner, as he was about to get up, Uncle Zhiquzi coughed twice.</p><p>"Tianlei, sit down first. Your mother and I have something to talk to you about."</p><p>He just said, there must be a problem.</p><p>"What's the matter? Tell me, I'm listening!"</p>

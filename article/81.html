						<p>"Captain Geng, transfer all the guards from the hospital grounds to the ICU ward immediately! The faster, the better!"</p><p>Li Ping dialed the phone; he was completely unable to handle the current situation.</p><p>Ge Yang did not want to make a big scene either. The reason he had arranged for his grandfather's subordinates to wait in the pavilion behind the inpatient building was mainly to prevent those people from causing further disturbances. He did not expect them not to come but instead to attack the staff at the hospital.</p><p>"Hmph, it's easy for you to say. With so many medical disputes these days, how can I just let this go? Who knows if you'll bite back later? Besides, this person is an unlicensed rural doctor who can barely treat pets like cats and dogs. How dare he sneak into a city hospital? Such a fraud should be sent to prison to suffer!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had been looking down, carefully observing the elderly Mr. Ge's condition. When he heard Li Ping's words, he slowly lifted his head.</p><p>"Do you know me?"</p><p>Only then did Li Ping truly see Zhu Tianlei, and upon seeing the other man's eyes staring at him like sharp swords, Li Ping pursed his lips.</p><p>"I, Li Ping, only know people who follow the law. There is no one like you, a fraud!"</p><p>"Fraud? Who have I deceived? Have I deceived your sister into bed or tricked your wife into cheating on you?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had not intended to intervene in this matter, but it was clear that Li Ping did not share his sentiment.</p><p>"You... what did you say? Say it again!"</p><p>Li Ping turned beet red at Zhu Tianlei's words. He really did have a younger sister, and his wife had indeed cheated on him. To hear such words from Zhu Tianlei made it unbearable for him to listen anymore.</p><p>"Good words are not said twice. Director Li, if there is no animosity between us, I advise you to be careful with your words, or else the consequences will be irreversible."</p><p>Li Ping looked at Zhu Tianlei's youthful face; his words could be considered incredibly arrogant.</p><p>A naive child, a rural-born barefoot doctor, and a con artist were separated by just a layer of paper window. They actually dared to stand here and challenge him.</p><p>How could this be tolerated?</p><p>"Director Li, all my men have arrived!"</p><p>After receiving the call, Geng Wenxue rushed over with his gang. When he saw dozens of people standing at the ICU entrance, he was immediately bewildered.</p><p>The ICU, specifically the VIP area, normally restricted medical staff to no more than three people. Now there were more people here than in a vegetable market, and the ward doors were wide open. What was going on?</p><p>Upon hearing Geng Wenxue's voice, Li Ping regained his confidence.</p><p>"Captain Geng, there are imposters claiming to be family members and have even attacked the patient. Take your men and apprehend them!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei coldly looked at the reinvigorated Li Ping, shook his head in pity, and sighed.</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"You, Director Li, are being used as a scapegoat and you don't realize it! Truly pitiful!"</p><p>"Who is being used as a scapegoat?"</p><p>These words shocked Li Ping. Could this kid know something?</p><p>"I have never met Director Li before, yet he knew my identity and that I am not the patient's family member. Isn't that strange?"</p><p>Li Ping's face turned pale.</p><p>No way, his relationship with Zhao Zhiguo was great. Zhao Zhiguo would never use him as Zhu Tianlei suggested. It must be this kid stirring up trouble.</p><p>"Hmph, I don't know what you're talking about. The facts are right in front of us. I have already reported to the Health Bureau. You'll be arrested for practicing medicine without a license!"</p><p>Seeing Li Ping's stubbornness, Zhu Tianlei did not want to speak any further. Sometimes people wanted to die so badly that you could not stop them.</p><p>At this moment, Geng Wenhui brought people with him and was about to rush into the ward. Before he even stepped through the door, he was directly knocked over.</p><p>It seemed like a fierce battle, but there was no sound at all.</p><p>After several thuds, all the security guards were lying on the ground, unable to get up. Looking at the people Gu Yang had summoned, each of them remained calm, standing by the door with their hands behind their backs.</p><p>Gu Yang seemed indifferent to this scene, his eyes focused solely on Old Master Gu.</p><p>Li Ping stood inside the door, not knowing whether to leave or stay.</p><p>Just then, the machines in the ward suddenly started beeping. The values on the machine screens appeared to be disrupted, changing wildly.</p><p>"You have killed the patient!"</p><p>Li Ping felt a mix of schadenfreude and panic. If the patient really died, his responsibility would be significant.</p><p>Gu Yang was also greatly shocked, looking at Old Master Gu with a pale face.</p><p>At this moment, another figure appeared at the door.</p><p>"Comrade, it is this person! He impersonated a doctor to defraud people all over!"</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's gaze fell on Zhao Zhiguo, who simultaneously looked back at Zhu Tianlei. Their gazes met, like ice and fire clashing.</p><p>"Zhiguo, he... has killed the patient!"</p><p>Li Ping was completely disoriented, his eyes frantic as he looked at Zhao Zhiguo.</p><p>Hearing these words, a flash of excitement quickly passed through Zhao Zhiguo's eyes. This time, he was not going to believe that Zhu Tianlei could not be killed.</p><p>"Dead? Didn't they say the patient's condition had improved? Comrade, this fraudster is simply too arrogant!"</p><p>Standing beside Zhao Zhiguo were two health bureau staff members in suits, one male and one female. The woman was not very old, probably in her early twenties.</p><p>"Who are you? Do you know that treating patients without a medical license is illegal? Now, due to improper treatment, the patient has died, which constitutes a serious crime. Please leave with us now and surrender to the judicial authorities for an investigation!"</p><p>The woman spoke in a matter-of-fact tone.</p><p>"Comrade, he was hired by me. The unexpected outcome of the treatment is my responsibility, not his!"</p><p>"Are you the patient's family member?"</p><p>Ge Yang struggled to suppress his grief and walked over to the staff members, saying,</p><p>"Yes, I am the patient's family member, his only relative."</p><p>"Young man, I understand how you feel, but this matter is not as simple as you say. He treated the patient without a medical license, which goes beyond a medical accident and becomes illegal. Even if the patient's family does not pursue it, we cannot ignore it."</p><p>Ge Yang was surprised by this reasoning; after all, the deceased was his grandfather, and he was not pursuing it. Why were these people so persistent?</p><p>"Yes, young man, you're too young to understand how sinister human nature can be. This person is a repeat offender, extremely audacious. You must have been deceived!"</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo seized every opportunity.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei watched Zhao Zhiguo's earnest efforts and sneered inwardly; if Zhao Zhiguo wanted to die, he would make it happen!</p><p>"Doctor Zhao says I am a repeat offender?"</p><p>"How could it not be? A few days ago, you committed fraud at the county hospital and managed to escape afterward. Today, even with wings, you can't fly away!"</p>

						<p>"Big brother, I don’t know you, but I know that without Doctor Zhu, my husband would be dead and our family would have fallen apart. To say it simply, Doctor Zhu is the savior of our family. This money, no matter what, I Li Daicui cannot accept; please take it back!"</p><p>Min Shengjun was also somewhat surprised. Ten thousand yuan was not a small sum for a rural family; it was enough to cover their living expenses for at least a year. This woman looked ordinary, and yet she had such magnanimity?</p><p>"Sister-in-law, this is Mr. Min’s token of appreciation, not money from me Zhu Tianlei. Please accept it!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had previously caused trouble at the clinic because of Li Daicui’s behavior and had also insulted Ma Lanlan, forming a poor impression of her. However, he never expected that Li Daicui was a person who clearly distinguished between right and wrong and was extremely grateful for kindness.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, no matter whose money this is, I Li Daicui cannot accept it. We have our hands and feet; we can earn our living. If big brother really has a kind heart, then give this money to people who need it more than our family!"</p><p>After saying that, Li Daicui handed over the paper bag in her hand with a determined look on her face.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei suddenly looked up to Li Daicui with great respect; this woman’s spirit and bearing were stronger than those of many men!</p><p>"Mr. Min, since that is the case, then please take the money!"</p><p>Min Shengjun thought for a moment and reached out to take back the money.</p><p>"Elder sister, you are a kind person. I will accept the money first. If you need anything from me Min in the future, just let Tianlei tell me, and I will definitely offer my utmost assistance!"</p><p>After leaving Li Daicui’s house, it was already afternoon.</p><p>The two of them walked back while chatting idly, and before long, they talked about setting up a pharmaceutical factory.</p><p>"Tianlei, you mentioned earlier that you planned to open a pharmaceutical factory. How is the preparation coming along?"</p><p>"Uncle Min, I have had the idea, but I haven’t started acting on it yet."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was somewhat embarrassed; he truly didn’t know where to start with setting up a pharmaceutical factory.</p><p>"Oh? What’s missing? Tell me, and Uncle Min will give you some advice!"</p><p>Min Shengjun had a good impression of Zhu Tianlei and was even more confident in this person. Since he was twenty, he had started his own business, relying not only on opportunities and an indomitable spirit but most importantly on having the ability to judge people accurately.</p><p>"I want to open a pharmaceutical factory mainly for processing traditional Chinese medicine. Currently, the medical market is dominated by Western medicine. I want to promote and popularize our ancestors' Traditional Chinese Medicine, and also help my fellow villagers become prosperous. However, this idea might be a bit unrealistic."</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei gave a slightly self-deprecating smile.</p><p>"Tianlei, your idea is great! Uncle Min fully supports it! Indeed, in recent years, Western culture has flooded in, overshadowing or even forgetting our local traditions. Your idea is excellent. When do you plan to start preparing?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was still very happy to get the endorsement from Min Shengjun, who was the president of the group.</p><p>"Don't laugh at me, Uncle Min, but I really have no idea how to prepare. I don't know what is needed or which steps to take first. Everything is unclear to me."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not hide his doubts. He genuinely needed someone to guide him, and Min Shengjun seemed like a very good choice.</p><p>"Tianlei, if you trust Uncle Min, I can arrange someone to help you with these procedures. How about it?"</p><p>"That's great! I've been worrying about where to start, so I leave this matter in your hands, Uncle Min!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was genuinely happy. In fact, Hao Xinmei could also help with this, but out of male pride, Zhu Tianlei did not plan on asking Hao Xinmei for assistance.</p><p>He never expected a favorable opportunity to suddenly drop from the sky, like a military advisor descending upon him. And Zhu Tianlei believed that the person Min Shengjun would find for him was definitely no ordinary individual.</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei agree immediately, Min Shengjun was also very happy and then carefully inquired about Zhu Tianlei's specific ideas. It wasn't until around 3:30 PM that he returned to Hachagou Village.</p><p>Village head Yao Gang had already been waiting at the clinic when they arrived. Seeing Min Shengjun and Zhu Tianlei return, his face lit up like a flower.</p><p>"Brother Jun, come, let's go to the village office. Dakuangzi and the others heard you were back and have been waiting for you there since early!"</p><p>The Dakuangzi Yao Gang mentioned was none other than Tan Dakuang, who had previously visited Zhu Tianlei to seek help delivering his daughter-in-law.</p><p>"Haha, hurry up and go! Tianlei, just wait for Uncle Min's message!"</p><p>"Okay!"</p><p>"Really? You're really planning to open a pharmaceutical factory?"</p><p>Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, Ma Lanlan was both surprised and excited.</p><p>You see, in Hama gou village, Hu Family's frog product processing plant was immensely successful, a dream desired by everyone in the village.</p><p>However, opening a factory wasn't like doing something else; it required real money, and besides, Hu Family's second son was also a town leader—conditions that not many others possessed.</p><p>That's why Ma Lanlan was so surprised to hear Zhu Tianlei's words.</p><p>"Stupid girl, what are you yelling about? It's just an idea right now, but I wanted to tell you first!"</p><p>Looking at Zhu Tianlei's handsome face and sincere eyes, Ma Lanlan felt her heart filled with something.</p><p>The feeling of being valued and trusted brought a sense of happiness as sweet as honey to Ma Lanlan.</p><p>"Tianlei, I believe you will definitely succeed!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan's gaze was sincere, her expression resolute.</p><p>A seed of hope sprouted in Zhu Tianlei's heart. Looking at the alluring face of Ma Lanlan before him and gazing out at the crimson sunset, he seemed to see a bright future beckoning him.</p><p>The next morning, just as Zhu Tianlei opened his eyes, his phone rang.</p><p>"Hello, is this Mr. Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>It was a woman's voice, and it was very sweet and pleasant to hear. However, Zhu Tianlei felt puzzled because he didn't seem to recognize the woman who spoke so delicately! </p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>"I am Miss Mao, my full name is Mao Yu, arranged by Mr. Min to help you with the procedures for setting up your pharmaceutical factory."</p><p>Mao Yu?</p><p>Why not Feathers? </p><p>Zhu Tianlei inexplicably felt like laughing. He hadn't expected Min Shengjun's actions to be so swift; just mentioned yesterday, and she was already set up, and it was even a sweet-sounding woman!</p><p>"Oh, nice to meet you, Miss Mao, I'm sorry for any trouble!"</p><p>It was mere politeness, but Zhu Tianlei still spoke quite well.</p><p>"Please bring your ID and household registration book to the village entrance in ten minutes. See you later!"</p><p>What?</p><p>Hearing the busy signal from the phone, a bunch of black lines appeared on Zhu Tianlei's forehead. What did this Miss Mao mean? It was only six o'clock!</p><p>And just for ten minutes!</p><p>Damn it!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei got dressed as quickly as if in military training and rushed to the south room to find his household registration book. Fortunately, Zhu Qiezi and his parents had gone out to work early in the morning; otherwise, he would have wasted a lot of words.</p><p>At the village entrance, a white CC was parked under a big tree. As soon as Zhu Tianlei approached, the engine started.</p><p>It was a woman's voice, sweet and melodious, which piqued Zhu Tianlei's curiosity. However, he couldn't place her; such a delicate tone didn't seem familiar to him.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>"I am Miss Mao, my full name is Mao Yu, sent by Mr. Min to assist you with the procedures for establishing your pharmaceutical factory."</p><p>Mao Yu?</p><p>Why not Feather? </p><p>Zhu Tianlei found himself inexplicably amused. He hadn't expected Min Shengjun's efficiency; just mentioned yesterday, and she was already arranged, and it was even a sweet-voiced woman!</p><p>"Oh, nice to meet you, Miss Mao, I'm sorry for any trouble!"</p><p>Though merely polite words, Zhu Tianlei delivered them smoothly.</p><p>"Mr. Zhu, please bring your ID and household registration book to the village entrance in ten minutes. See you then!"</p><p>What?</p><p>Hearing the busy signal on the phone, lines appeared on Zhu Tianlei's forehead. What did Miss Mao mean? It was only six o'clock!</p><p>And just for ten minutes!</p><p>Damn it!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei dressed quickly as if under military orders and rushed to the south room to retrieve his household registration book. Fortunately, Zhu Qiezi and his parents had gone out early in the morning; otherwise, he would have spent a lot of time explaining.</p><p>At the village entrance, a white CC car was parked under a big tree. As soon as Zhu Tianlei approached, the engine started.</p><p>The voice on the other end was unmistakably that of a woman, sweet and enchanting, sending shivers down Zhu Tianlei's spine. However, he found himself perplexed; her tone didn't ring any bells in his memory.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>"I am Miss Mao, my full name is Mao Yu, sent by Mr. Min to assist you with the establishment of your pharmaceutical factory."</p><p>Mao Yu?</p><p>Why not Feather? </p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but chuckle at the thought. He hadn't anticipated such swift action from Min Shengjun; just mentioned yesterday, and she was already in place, a sweetly spoken woman!</p><p>"Oh, nice to meet you, Miss Mao, I apologize for any inconvenience."</p><p>Though mere pleasantries, Zhu Tianlei spoke them with ease.</p><p>"Mr. Zhu, please bring your ID and household registration book to the village entrance in ten minutes. See you then!"</p><p>What?</p><p>Hearing the busy signal from the phone, Zhu Tianlei's brows furrowed deeply. What did Miss Mao mean? It was only six o'clock!</p><p>And just for ten minutes!</p><p>Damn it!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei dressed with military precision and rushed to the south room to fetch his household registration book. Fortunately, Zhu Qiezi and his parents had already gone out early in the morning; otherwise, he would have wasted a lot of time explaining.</p><p>At the village entrance, a white CC car was parked under a big tree. As soon as Zhu Tianlei approached, the engine started.</p>

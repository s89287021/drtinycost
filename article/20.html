						<p>The two people arrived at the village bus stop just as the bus was pulling in. Zhu Tianlei quickly got on the bus, not because of anything else but because he couldn't let Yang Xiaoxue pay for the ticket! The bus was a 36-seater minivan that had been originally owned by the government. About seven or eight years ago, it was bought out and became an individual's business. Not only was the vehicle old and drafty, overloading was common. Even at the second stop, there were no more seats left on the bus. Yang Xiaoxue and Zhu Tianlei were squeezed to the back of the carriage upon getting in.</p><p>There was no air conditioning in the bus, and although all the windows were open, it could not combat the heat of August. With many people inside, the atmosphere inside was extremely stuffy, filled with a mixture of sweat and other odors.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue clearly felt uncomfortable. Unfortunately, she was seated next to a middle-aged man with a broad chest and thick waist, who was bare-chested and wearing only black boxers. Yang Xiaoxue couldn't look away from him no matter how much she tried.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took one step forward and positioned himself between Yang Xiaoxue and the middle-aged man.</p><p>Since it was a mountain road, the car had been swaying since it started moving. There was almost no distance between Yang Xiaoxue and Zhu Tianlei. With each shake of the vehicle, Yang Xiaoxue's body would naturally press against Zhu Tianlei's back.</p><p>The soft and high breasts of the woman continuously rubbed against Zhu Tianlei's back. This torture was too much for the young man to bear. Although they were in a public bus, his arousal could not be helped.</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was experiencing both comfort and pain, he suddenly heard a scream from nearby, which then caused the entire bus to erupt into chaos.</p><p>"Stop the bus! Stop the bus! Someone is dead!"</p><p>A woman's voice, sharp with fear.</p><p>The bus screeched to a halt. Zhu Tianlei first steadied Yang Xiaoxue, who nearly lost her balance and fell, and then looked toward the back of the carriage. A man in his sixties or seventies was lying on the floor, pale-faced with purple lips.</p><p>A woman in her forties stood beside him, looking terrified; she had been the one to scream earlier.</p><p>"Stop all this noise! Ah, this person can't die on the bus; if he does, how will we carry passengers in the future? Who is his family?"</p><p>The bus conductor squeezed through the crowd. Seeing the old man's face, his expression immediately darkened.</p><p>After yelling out, no one answered. The driver got the message and walked over from the front of the vehicle.</p><p>"Are you his relative?"</p><p>The ticket seller, clenching her waist, asked the middle-aged woman who had just let out a scream.</p><p>"Phfft, I don't know him. Don't make things up! If this guy dies, it's your responsibility, not mine. No way you're blaming me!"</p><p>The middle-aged woman was also shrewd, afraid of being blamed. In a few sentences, she managed to clear herself.</p><p>The ticket seller and the driver were husband and wife, so this fell under marital business. Hearing what the middle-aged woman said, they exchanged glances, and the driver moved in.</p><p>"Since none of you know this old man, we'll take him off the vehicle. Everyone look, he's still breathing now! If he dies later, everyone here will be our witnesses!"</p><p>Although some people on the bus felt uncomfortable, no one dared to speak up about such a serious matter. Thus, the compartment became much quieter than before.</p><p>"Hold it! He has asthmatic shock and can't be moved. Moving him could worsen his condition and put his life in real danger!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei immediately identified the old man's illness. Although he was a stranger, given his age and being out on the road, he couldn't just ignore the situation.</p><p>"Where did you come from?"</p><p>The ticket seller hadn't expected there to be such an interfering person on the bus, and this person didn't seem to be anyone important. She didn't take Zhu Tianlei seriously at all.</p><p>"I'm a doctor."</p><p>"Phfft, a doctor like you? You should look in a mirror and check your character! If you're a doctor, I'm a professor. Go away, go away, old Li, get moving!"</p><p>The ticket seller gave Zhu Tianlei a white eye and urgently commanded her husband to lift the person off the vehicle.</p><p>"He is indeed a doctor, I can testify. Let him examine this gentleman; I believe he can revive him!"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei speak up for justice, Yang Xiaoxue felt an inexplicable sense of pride. Now seeing that neither the driver and his wife nor anyone else on the bus trusted Zhu Tianlei, she couldn't help but step forward.</p><p>"Hmm, quite a few busybodies today! You can testify? Who are you? Are you a policeman, doctor, or even the Premier? Listen, if you two keep hindering us from moving him, I'll throw both of you off the bus!"</p><p>"Don't waste time talking to them, hurry and lift him up! I can see that old man has only one breath left. Don't let him die in the car; it would be unlucky!"</p><p>The ticket seller was anxious, fearing that the old man would die on the vehicle.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue had been scolded by the driver a few times and looked rather unhappy. She was about to speak again when Zhu Tianlei reached out to stop her.</p><p>"Hold this for me, don't worry!"</p><p>"I need to save a life. Move aside."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said coldly. The other passengers were afraid of getting involved, so they all moved away without waiting for Zhu Tianlei to finish speaking.</p><p>Only the driver and his wife remained, glaring at Zhu Tianlei with bared teeth.</p><p>"Brat, don't refuse my offer and accept a punishment instead! I, Li Dongkui, have been driving on this route for over ten years, and no one has dared to show off in front of me. If you know what's good for you, get out of my way!"</p><p>The driver was tall and muscular, around forty years old. Without even mentioning anything else, just by looking at the tiger-head tattoo on his shoulders, it was clear that he wasn't entirely boasting.</p><p>However, Zhu Tianlei pretended not to hear him, slowly squatting down and placing his hand on the old man's wrist. He could feel the erratic pulse and chaotic blood flow, indicating extreme danger. If not for the spiritual energy inherited from Purple Heart Immortal Medicine in his body, it would indeed be impossible to reverse the situation.</p><p>Thinking of this, Zhu Tianlei did not hesitate, focusing his mind and breathing calmly, gathering the spiritual energy in his body and slowly transmitting it through his fingers into the old man's body.</p><p>At that moment, Li Dongkui suddenly attacked, reaching out with both hands as if to grab Zhu Tianlei's shoulders. Yang Xiaoxue's face turned deathly pale with fright, about to shout, but she saw Zhu Tianlei duck and lean slightly to the right at the same time, his left hand reaching out and grabbing the air, causing Li Dongkui to be thrown out with a thud.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei was seen again, he was still squatting beside the old man, holding his wrist, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>After being thrown out, Li Dongkui did not bother to check the bleeding gash on his head and immediately lunged at Zhu Tianlei again.</p><p>This time, for some reason, the passengers decided to help. The middle-aged man without a shirt stood up first and positioned himself between Zhu Tianlei and Li Dongkui.</p><p>"This young man seems to be knowledgeable in medicine, so you might as well let him off!"</p><p>"That's right, this old man looks much better already!"</p><p>"You're right, the both of you should probably call it quits. Doing this kind of work, accumulating some good karma is a good thing for you!"</p><p>......</p>

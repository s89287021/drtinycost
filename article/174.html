						<p>Zhu Tianlei almost stayed awake all night, and by the time dawn broke on the second day, a commotion was already heard outside the quarantine zone.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stepped out and happened to meet Li Ping coming out of his door at the same time.</p><p>"Tianlei, what's wrong with you?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei’s haggard appearance, sallow cheeks, dark eye sockets, and full beard, Li Ping couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise. Zhu Tianlei casually wiped his face; he did feel bristly on his chin but paid no mind to it. He called out to Li Ping and the two rushed out.</p><p>Outside the quarantine zone’s fence, several cars were parked side by side. A group of people in protective suits stood beside them, each wearing a red cross armband.</p><p>One person saw Zhu Tianlei and hurried over as soon as he came out.</p><p>This man was in his late twenties, with an urbane appearance. The moment he saw Zhu Tianlei, excitement appeared on his face.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, we meet again!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned but then his eyes lit up.</p><p>"You're Shen Haifeng from the emergency center."</p><p>"Haha, Doctor Zhu is truly amazing! You even remember my name; that's an honor!"</p><p>Shen Haifeng’s joy was genuine. It was like you stood outside your idol’s door every day hoping to catch a glimpse of them, but one day you finally fulfilled your wish and saw your idol. Before you could speak, the idol called out your name.</p><p>This was exactly how Shen Haifeng felt inside.</p><p>"Are you here to support us?"</p><p>"Yes, I am the leader of the medical volunteer team."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei barely slept through the night, and by the second morning’s faint light, a commotion erupted outside the quarantine zone.</p><p>Stepping out, Zhu Tianlei encountered Li Ping just as he was leaving his door.</p><p>"Tianlei, what happened to you?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei’s exhausted appearance—his sallow cheeks, dark eye sockets, and full beard of stubble—Li Ping couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise. Zhu Tianlei casually wiped his face; the rough sensation on his chin didn't bother him. He greeted Li Ping and they rushed out together.</p><p>Outside the quarantine zone’s fence, several cars were parked side by side. A group of people in protective suits stood beside them, each wearing a red cross armband.</p><p>One man saw Zhu Tianlei and quickly approached.</p><p>This man was in his late twenties, with a scholarly appearance. The moment he saw Zhu Tianlei, excitement flashed across his face.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, we meet again!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned but then his eyes lit up.</p><p>"You're Shen Haifeng from the emergency center."</p><p>"Haha, Doctor Zhu is truly amazing!

Stepping out, he encountered Li Ping just as he was leaving his door.</p><p>"Tianlei, what happened to you?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei’s haggard appearance—sallow cheeks, dark eye sockets, and a full beard of stubble—Li Ping couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise.

As their hands shook, Shen Haifeng was visibly trembling with excitement.</p><p>"Oh, Doctor Zhu, take a look at who this is?"</p><p>After Shen Haifeng spoke, he reached out to pull a figure standing by over. This person kept his head down, so his face could not be seen, but Zhu Tianlei immediately recognized him.</p><p>"Doctor Xue, welcome to join the infectious disease control team!"</p><p>Xue Ping raised her head and saw Zhu Tianlei's sincere smile. Although this face looked extremely weary, it instantly warmed and strengthened Xue Ping's heart.</p><p>After brief pleasantries, Shen Haifeng began arranging the new support team members he had brought along; there were a total of thirty-nine people, all volunteers from various hospitals in Yunhai City. Zhu Tianlei glanced at the list and silently memorized their names.</p><p>Along with the support team, two trucks loaded with supplies arrived—one carrying medical supplies and the other living essentials. Shen Haifeng mentioned that all the supplies bound for the isolation area had been personally inspected and approved by Mayor Yang.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt a greater sense of respect for Yang Wenjie.</p><p>Once everyone's accommodations and offices were settled, Li Ping and Li Yong took charge of familiarizing the accompanying doctors with the isolation area environment and the progress of infectious disease treatment. Zhao Xin was responsible for guiding the nurses through their care procedures and requirements.</p><p>With the expansion of the medical team, the entire isolation area came alive in a way it never had before. Watching the bustling figures, Zhu Tianlei felt as though he had returned to sunlight once more.</p><p>After lunch, Shen Haifeng and Xue Ping entered Zhu Tianlei's laboratory.</p><p>"So, Doctor Zhu, you suspect that the infection is caused by giant snails?"</p><p>Shen Haifeng asked after hearing Zhu Tianlei's explanation.</p><p>"Based on what I've learned so far, that appears to be the case."</p><p>Shen Haifeng slightly puffed out his chest with a hint of pride.</p><p>"Great, come in quickly, Haifeng!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei personally opened the protective door and welcomed Shen Haifeng inside.

Their handshake was filled with excitement as Shen Haifeng's hands trembled noticeably.</p><p>"Oh, Doctor Zhu, let me introduce you to someone."</p><p>Shen Haifeng gestured for a figure standing by to approach. The person kept his head lowered, so his face was obscured, but Zhu Tianlei immediately recognized him.</p><p>"Doctor Xue, welcome to join our infectious disease control team!"</p><p>Xue Ping lifted her head and saw Zhu Tianlei's genuine smile. Despite looking extremely weary, it instantly filled her heart with warmth and determination.</p><p>After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Shen Haifeng began organizing the thirty-nine volunteers from various hospitals in Yunhai City who had joined the support team. Zhu Tianlei quickly scanned through their names, committing them to memory.</p><p>Alongside the support team, two trucks arrived—one laden with medical supplies and the other with essentials for daily life. Shen Haifeng mentioned that all these supplies bound for the isolation area had been personally inspected and approved by Mayor Yang.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt a renewed sense of respect for Yang Wenjie.</p><p>Once everyone was settled in their accommodations and offices, Li Ping and Li Yong led the accompanying doctors to familiarize themselves with the isolation area and the progress of infectious disease treatment. Zhao Xin took charge of guiding the nurses through their care procedures and requirements.</p><p>With the influx of new medical personnel, the isolation area came alive like never before. Watching the bustling activity, Zhu Tianlei felt as though he had returned to sunlight once more.</p><p>After lunch, Shen Haifeng and Xue Ping joined Zhu Tianlei in his laboratory.</p><p>"So, Doctor Zhu, you suspect that the infection is caused by giant snails?"</p><p>Shen Haifeng asked after hearing Zhu Tianlei's explanation.</p><p>"Based on my findings so far, it appears to be the case."</p><p>"But Dr. Zhu, I have always loved eating large conch shells since I was a child and have some understanding of them. Although there are parasites in their bodies, they do not survive high temperatures. Moreover, these parasites cannot even survive outside the body, let alone be transmitted."</p><p>Shen Haifeng stated his opinion.</p><p>"You mentioned this; I also checked it online, and it is indeed true. When I said transmission, I did not mean the parasites inside them. In recent days, I have studied all the infectious diseases that have erupted in recent decades, especially nns that emerged a few decades ago. The root cause of these epidemics lies with the minks, who contracted nns and then transmitted it to the farmers who caught them. The farmers spread nns to others while selling the minks..."</p><p>This segment was already memorized by Zhu Tianlei word for word.</p><p>"Dr. Zhu, have you been able to confirm the transmission route of the disease?"</p><p>Xue Ping had stood behind Shen Haifeng all along, feeling a mix of guilt and shame towards Zhu Tianlei due to the incident back then.</p><p>"There are many transmission routes, but the most important one is physical contact. While air and droplets can also spread it, the probability is very low."</p><p>This was the part that made Zhu Tianlei feel most relieved, as physical contact is much less harmful compared to air and droplet transmission. Otherwise, half of Yunhai City might be overtaken by the virus.</p><p>"Dr. Zhu, before we came in, Director Ren from the Health Bureau gave us a report to hand over to you. We hope it will help with the control and treatment of the disease."</p><p>Xue Ping then took out the report handed to her by Ren Congzhou and passed it to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>This was a joint disease investigation report issued by the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Health Commission. Although preventive measures had been announced, they were still internal notifications circulated within a small circle, and most of the public remained unaware of the situation.</p><p>The report provided detailed data, with the last number being particularly startling.</p><p>"7,658 people..."</p><p>A total of 7,658 people across the country have been infected, with 674 fatalities, resulting in a mortality rate of 8.8%. This mortality rate is 3 percentage points higher than that of nns from back then.</p><p>"Dr. Zhu, it was likely our Yunhai that first discovered suspected cases."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei closed the report solemnly. Indeed, fortunately, Secretary Qiao had an exceptionally high sensitivity to diseases; otherwise, who knows how many cases would have been treated as ordinary patients by now.</p><p>"Scholar Sister Xue, Hai Feng, actually I configured a drug yesterday, but the results of the experiment were not good. Both of you are graduates from professional schools and have much higher professional levels than me. Please help analyze where the problem lies."</p><p>Hearing what Zhu Tianlei said, Xue Ping and Shen Haifeng felt delighted and honored. After all, being praised by someone almost regarded as a medical sage was not something that everyone could enjoy.</p><p>At the same time, both of them became even more convinced of Zhu Tianlei's character. Everyone knew what this prescription meant: if this prescription could really cure infectious diseases, this person's name would surely be etched in history.</p><p>However, Zhu Tianlei showed no hesitation at all and calmly handed over the prescription to them. This trust was heavier than Mount Tai.</p><p>The two exchanged glances and then focused their attention entirely on the prescription.</p>

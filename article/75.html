						<p>Song Bonian had already understood the meaning and implications of Zhu Tianlei's question, so after finishing, he looked at Qi Xuehua thoughtfully.</p><p>"Very well, since that is the case, then please Dean Song to be my witness!"</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, the ward door creaked open.</p><p>Feng Xiaoyu was wearing a patient gown and stood straight in everyone's line of sight.</p><p>"This is impossible!"</p><p>Qi Xuehua looked at Feng Xiaoyu as if she had seen a ghost. When she noticed the reactions on others' faces, she realized her attitude was problematic.</p><p>"I... I was just too shocked, this patient's condition is very severe; it's impossible for him to recover so quickly."</p><p>Although Qi Xuehua reacted quickly, to others, it seemed like she was trying to cover something up.</p><p>Qiu Ran also felt a chill in his palms.</p><p>He could even imagine the immense anger his father-in-law would feel after learning about this.</p><p>"Xiaoyu, you're okay?"</p><p>Yang Hua rushed over excitedly, his hands trembling, as this result was utterly unexpected for him.</p><p>"Uncle Yang, I'm fine now, thank you!"</p><p>Feng Xiaoyu smiled sweetly. Although scars were still visible on her body, the originally ulcerated and purulent sores had all scabbed over.</p><p>"Good child, good child, no need to thank me; thank him instead, without him, Uncle Yang would never have been able to cure you!"</p><p>Song Bosen looked at Zhu Tianlei, his heart was also in a tumultuous state.</p><p>He knew the condition of this young patient very well and had participated with Yang Hua in conducting a three-day systematic examination. Almost all instruments and diagnostic methods were used, yet not only had they failed to find any treatment, even the cause of the illness remained elusive.</p><p>However, this young man managed to cure a dying patient within just two or three hours and stood before everyone as if nothing happened. Such medical skills simply exceeded his imagination.</p><p>"Little sister, tell us!" </p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at Feng Xiaoyu and said softly.</p><p>"It was her! She put something in the water she gave me!"</p><p>Feng Xiaoyu pointed to Pang Lan, who was curled up on a bench, her fingers trembling slightly.</p><p>"Put something in?"</p><p>Yang Hua was puzzled; what kind of situation was this?</p><p>Although Pang Lan could neither speak nor move, she could hear and see. She knew that everything had been exposed. At this moment, all she wanted to do was hide and not be seen by anyone.</p><p>"Pang Lan, I didn't expect you to cry wolf! I trusted you so much, only to find out that Xiao Yu's illness wasn't caused by disease but by your doing. You really have a heart of stone; how could you do this to such a young child? And you even used me as a scapegoat. Fortunately, this young man stepped in to turn the tide; otherwise, I would have had to bear the blame for the rest of my life, Secretary Qiu. Such villains must be caught and punished to assuage public anger!"</p><p>Qi Xuehua spoke quickly and urgently. Qiu Ran understood and immediately commanded his subordinates to prepare to arrest her.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled faintly and stood in front of Pang Lan in a swift motion, like a startled swallow.</p><p>"President Qi, are you planning to kill and silence someone in public?"</p><p>"Eh... young man, what are you talking about? The previous incident was just a misunderstanding; I was also deceived by this woman. Now, I want to help you vent your anger!"</p><p>"I don't need President Qi's involvement. I prefer to handle my own affairs."</p><p>A sense of foreboding suddenly crept into Qi Xuehua's heart.</p><p>But before she could say anything, Zhu Tianlei's hand landed on Pang Lan's shoulder.</p><p>"You vicious woman, do you want to cut the bridge after crossing it? Hmph, do you really think that people's words are just two layers of skin, and whatever you say goes? Since you're not kind, don't blame me for being unrighteous. Officer, I confess, this woman made the poison in the little bastard's water."</p><p>Pang Lan's fingers fiercely landed on Qi Xuehua's body.</p><p>"You... you're lying, President, I didn't do it. I'm the vice president of the hospital and a doctor. How could I do such a thing? Besides, I don't even know Feng Xiaoyu; I had no motive to harm her!"</p><p>Qi Xuehua was extremely panicked and hurriedly explained to Song Binian how much effort she had put in to reach her current position. She absolutely couldn't afford to lose.</p><p>"President Qi is truly a master of rhetoric. President Qi's motive isn't to kill Feng Xiaoyu, but to pin the blame on me for Feng Xiaoyu's death. Could this not be President Qi's true intention?"</p><p>Qi Xuehua's body trembled. How could Zhu Tianlei say that? Did he know something?</p><p>"This statement of yours is somewhat laughable. This is the first time I've met you today; how would I pin the blame on you? I don't know why you're accusing me like this. Is it just because of a misunderstanding we had earlier? In that case, I apologize to you, I'm sorry!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sneered.</p><p>This woman is truly ruthless, able to bend and stretch, changing her course with the wind. It seems she didn't reach this position by chance, but her career was about to end here because she shouldn't have provoked him!</p><p>"President Qi's mindset is truly admirable, but facts are facts. No matter how much you try to cover it up, it can't be hidden. When you look into the abyss, the abyss looks back at you. It seems President Qi hasn't heard this saying!"</p><p>After that, Zhu Tianlei suddenly took out a phone from his hand.</p><p>Qi Xuehua's face turned ghastly pale upon seeing the phone, all her composure crumbling down.</p><p>When did the phone get into Zhu Tianlei's hands?</p><p>"Let's see just how busy President Qi has been. This morning at 9:20 AM, the call was with... Secretary Qiu. Let's take a look; oh my, it seems President Qi and Secretary Qiu are quite close. There are so many call records these past two days. What did you guys talk about?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's fingers lightly swiped across the smartphone screen, not forgetting to wave it around in front of everyone.</p><p>"Oh, and Zhao Zhiguo... turns out President Qi and Doctor Zhao know each other, no wonder. It's said that birds of a feather flock together, so it's no surprise that President Qi and Doctor Zhao get along well. The way the two of them act and do things is really identical, equally despicable!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's tone had always been as gentle as spring rain, but President Qi Xuehua's heart was freezing bit by bit.</p><p>"Hmm, there's even a recording here, let's listen..."</p><p>After Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, he was about to open the audio file, when Qi Xuehua suddenly screamed and tried to snatch the smartphone from Zhu Tianlei's hand. However, Zhu Tianlei's fingers were too quick for Qi Xuehua to catch up with; with a light movement of his fingerpad, a voice came out of the phone.</p><p>"Xiaohua, you're all set, huh... yeah..."</p><p>"Yeah... Zhiguo, you're so big... I can't take it anymore..."</p><p>"Haha... as long as you get rid of that brat Zhu Tianlei for me, I'll let you have your fill..."</p><p>"Mmm... everything is arranged, the whore Pang Lan has taken the money and given him the drug... Zhiguo... hurry up..."</p><p>...</p>

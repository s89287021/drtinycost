						<p>Because too many people attended the meeting, it was held in the square outside Tianlei Pharmaceutical Factory.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei rejected the speech draft that Mao Yuhai had written for him earlier and spoke entirely on the spot. In his view, anyone who wanted to collaborate with Tianlei Pharmaceutical not only needed to recognize its products but also had to acknowledge him, Zhu Tianlei himself.</p><p>As they say, if two people do not share the same path, they cannot join forces.</p><p>"I, Zhu Tianlei, have a low level of education and may not be able to express deep thoughts. However, I, Zhu Tianlei, can promise everyone here that every box of medicine produced by Tianlei Pharmaceutical is qualified and made with integrity!"</p><p>A thunderous applause erupted from the audience, 80% of whom came from Yunhai City, and 20% from other places, all of whom had come out of curiosity.</p><p>Most people had initially attended just to join in the fun, but after hearing Zhu Tianlei's unique insights into traditional Chinese medicine, their interest was piqued instead.</p><p>"My speech is now concluded. Please allow our corporate consultant, Miss Mao Yuhai, to provide further introductions to our esteemed guests."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's speech lasted only about three or four minutes, yet it elicited thunderous applause seven or eight times over. Standing beside him on the stage, Mao Yuhai was also moved by this.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's rise could be described as rapid and miraculous.</p><p>Taking advantage of everyone's attention being drawn to Mao Yuhai, Zhu Tianlei slipped off the stage and engaged in a flirtatious exchange with Hao Xinhui until her hair was disheveled and her face flushed.</p><p>In just a few months, Tu Feng had risen to become a backbone of Tianlei Pharmaceutical through his talents, earning the trust of both Zhu Tianlei and Mao Yuhai.</p><p>Watching the long queue forming before the negotiation table, Mao Yuhai nodded with satisfaction.</p><p>Rising from desolate plains, advancing through gunfire and bullets, a company gaining industry recognition so swiftly would surely elicit excitement in anyone!</p><p>...</p><p>"Consultant Mao, something's wrong! Representatives from the municipal drug administration have arrived!"</p><p>Just as Mao Yu was sitting on a chair at the edge of the venue, enjoying the sight before him, the hostess Xiao He ran over in a panic.</p><p>"The people from the FDA are here anyway. Why are you so flustered?"</p><p>Mao Yu frowned. She was dissatisfied with Xiao He's lack of composure on such an important day.</p><p>"It's not like that, Consultant Mao. The people from the FDA said they're coming to investigate Tianlei Pharmaceuticals. They're already at the door!"</p><p>Xiao He's eyes were red from her distress. Though she had only been with the company for a short time, she already felt as if it was her home, and she did not want anything untoward to happen there.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Mao Yu stood up abruptly. Indeed, several people in FDA uniforms were approaching within her line of sight.</p><p>What's going on?</p><p>Why would the FDA suddenly come to investigate, and that too on such an important day.</p><p>However, regardless of the reason, Mao Yu reacted immediately, quickly walking towards them.</p><p>"Good afternoon, I am Consultant Mao Yu from Tianlei Pharmaceuticals. May I ask which of you are from the FDA?"</p><p>Mao Yu was wearing a crimson purple business suit that made her skin appear even fairer, and with her naturally commanding presence, she could not be underestimated.</p><p>"Yes, we have received a report to conduct an evidentiary investigation into Tianlei Pharmaceuticals."</p><p>The middle-aged man at the front spoke solemnly, his face devoid of any smile. Mao Yu felt a chill run down her spine.</p><p>"Could you please tell us what the contents of the complaint are? After all, Tianlei Pharmaceuticals has only been established for a short time, and all the medicines we produce have been filed with the FDA. I believe everyone is aware of this."</p><p>This was something Mao Yu was most confident about.</p><p>"The content of the report involves our internal work secrets, which we cannot disclose. Since you are a consultant from Tianlei Pharmaceuticals, please call over the legal representative of Tianlei Pharmaceuticals!"</p><p>The person leading the group had been maintaining a stern expression, and the smile that had previously lit up Mao Yu's face quickly faded.</p><p>"I am fully authorized to handle all matters concerning Tianlei Pharmaceutical on behalf of the legal representative. If you have any issues, just speak directly with me."</p><p>Mao Yu's personality was always accommodating when faced with softness but equally firm in the presence of strength. Since this person clearly refused to give her any face, there was no need for her to be overly friendly. Tianlei Pharmaceutical operated with integrity and righteousness, so she felt confident.</p><p>"We want to see the legal representative."</p><p>The middle-aged man glanced at Mao Yu, his tone turning even more hostile.</p><p>"If you have something to say, speak to me; if not, leave. The door is over there."</p><p>Mao Yu pointed to the door they had just entered, her tone unkind as she spoke. Xiao He behind her was so frightened that she turned pale.</p><p>What was going on with Consultant Mao? The other party was from the Food and Drug Administration, their direct superior in their pharmaceutical factory.</p><p>"You... you, go inside for an inspection. I won't believe that a mere corporate consultant would dare to obstruct FDA staff from enforcing regulations."</p><p>There were five or six people in total; upon hearing the leader's instructions, the others immediately took a step forward. With only Mao Yu and Xiao He, two unskilled girls, they did not take them seriously at all.</p><p>"Do you dare take another step?"</p><p>The other party looked at Mao Yu's icy face and suddenly twisted his mouth into a smile, but it was as if a fox smelling the scent of chicken meat.</p><p>"It is you, this corporate consultant, who has forced my hand..."</p><p>The leader stretched out his hand and pulled out a megaphone from behind him. Mao Yu instantly felt something amiss, but the other party's actions were too swift; she could not stop them in time.</p><p>"We are representatives of the Yunhai City Food and Drug Administration. We have received reports that Tianlei Pharmaceutical may be involved in illegal production practices. We need to conduct a shutdown inspection of the factory. Please cooperate with us, all employees of Tianlei Pharmaceutical..."</p><p>Mao Yu clenched his fists tightly, the other party had come prepared.</p><p>Now this was certain; they did not arrive early or late but precisely when Tianlei Pharmaceutical's investment conference was taking place. Their intentions were despicable.</p><p>"Mao Consultant, how are you?"</p><p>A middle-aged man looked at Mao Yu with a sinister smile, no longer bothering to hide his ulterior motives.</p><p>Mao Yu could not imagine the impact those two sentences would have on the investment conference and Tianlei Pharmaceutical.</p><p>"What do you want to achieve?"</p><p>"Youthful Mao Consultant has a rather poor memory. I told you, we came here after receiving a report of illegal production by Tianlei Pharmaceutical. Let's go!"</p><p>The middle-aged man waved his hand, leading several people in with a swagger past Mao Yu.</p><p>Xiao He, standing beside Mao Yu, was terrified and her tears dripped down uncontrollably. She did not want anything bad to happen to Tianlei Pharmaceutical!</p><p>The middle-aged man led the group marching swiftly towards the center of the conference hall.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood at the edge of the hall near a passageway, watching the approaching figures with a slight curve on his lips.</p><p>The sound from the loudspeaker had already caused significant disruption in the hall. The clients who were signing contracts put down their pens, looking puzzled and serious as several pharmaceutical inspection bureau officials walked to the center of the conference hall.</p><p>"Ladies and gentlemen, we are staff from the Yunhai City Pharmaceutical Inspection Bureau. We have received anonymous reports about illegal production by Tianlei Pharmaceutical and have come to verify this information. We apologize for any inconvenience caused!"</p>

						<p>"Is that so?"</p><p>Yang Zhongjie shuddered all over.</p><p>He stared, open-mouthed, at Yang Wenjie in his dark blue Shanxi-style suit as he emerged from the crowd.</p><p>His face turned pale instantly.</p><p>Why was Yang Wenjie here?</p><p>"Mayor... Mayor Yang, how could you be here?"</p><p>Yang Zhongmin smiled extremely obsequiously, and simultaneously rose to his feet by propping himself up with both hands on the ground.</p><p>"Deputy County Magistrate Yang, what a powerful presence!"</p><p>"I didn't know Mayor Yang was here; I was also coerced by Zhu Tianlei into speaking without reserve."</p><p>Yang Zhongmin knew well that this statement was dry and lacked any credibility.</p><p>But that's how the political arena worked. How many people would speak the truth, report facts honestly, and treat others sincerely?</p><p>With a new emperor comes new ministers; there were no eternal relationships.</p><p>"Yang Zhongmin, is the child on the ground someone you hired to kill?"</p><p>"Mayor Yang, heaven and earth can be my witness! I've never even met this child before; how could I hire someone to harm him? All of this is Zhu Tianlei's intentional frame-up and revenge!"</p><p>Having spent so long in the political arena, Yang Zhongmin had a strong psychological resilience. The fear of death he once felt had vanished. Standing with wet trouser cuffs, he skillfully defended himself.</p><p>"Mayor Yang, I need to examine the body."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at Yang Zhongmin, then looked at the small steel bouncy lying on the ground. He said in a solemn voice,</p><p>"No, I do not allow anyone to damage my son's body."</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, Xiao Gangpeng's mother leaped up and loudly rebutted.</p><p>"Elder Sister, I guarantee that we will absolutely not harm Xiao Gangpeng's body, not even a hair."</p><p>Facing this woman, Zhu Tianlei showed 200% patience.</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Yes, really. Xiao Gangpeng is someone I rescued from Death's grasp in the isolation zone; I cherish him just as much as Elder Sister does."</p><p>For some reason, upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, the woman's emotions seemed to be doused like a fire heap; the flames no longer burned.</p><p>"Alright, you can check!"</p><p>Yang Wenjie nodded. Regardless of whether this child was killed by Yang Zhongmin or not, the cause of death needed to be confirmed. Not only was Zhu Tianlei a doctor, but his skills in examining corpses were also exceptional.</p><p>Upon receiving Yang Wenjie's approval, Zhu Tianlei slowly crouched beside Xiao Gangpeng's body. Those slightly open eyes seemed to still carry a smile.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned away from the view; he could not bear to look, fearing that seeing any further would cause tears to well up in his eyes.</p><p>He placed his hand on Xiao Gangpeng's chest. Since the time of death was not very long ago, Xiao Gangpeng's body was still soft, just as Zhu Tianlei had seen during his rounds in the isolation zone for several nights.</p><p>However, this time, no matter when dawn arrived, Xiao Gangpeng would never wake up again.</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei's hand touched a spot about an inch below Xiao Gangpeng's throat, his finger encountered something hard.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face immediately darkened.</p><p>"The objects in Xiao Gang's throat are blades."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>The moment Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, the entire auditorium echoed with gasps.</p><p>Even Yang Zhongmin himself was stunned.</p><p>Xiao Gang's mother rolled her eyes and fainted.</p><p>"Tianlei, this......"</p><p>Yang Wenjie wanted to say it couldn't be true, but he knew that if Zhu Tianlei wasn't confident, he wouldn't have said anything. Zhu Tianlei's abilities and character were well-known.</p><p>"Yang Zhongmin, I ask you now, where are those people?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression could no longer be described as angry; it was a word beyond any dictionary definition.</p><p>"I......I......don't know......."</p><p>Yang Zhongmin stuttered. If he revealed the whereabouts of those people, it would mean admitting to hiring someone for murder. Not only would his position as vice-county magistrate be in jeopardy, but his life might not be safe either.</p><p>"Don't know?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei repeated the question. Yang Zhongmin nodded mechanically, but before he could nod a second time, he saw a flash of darkness before his eyes, followed by someone pinching his chin tightly.</p><p>In Zhu Tianlei's hand was a silver needle.</p><p>"You.....what are you going to do......"</p><p>Yang Zhongmin's voice trembled. He knew that Zhu Tianlei was arrogant, but he had underestimated the extent of that arrogance. Yang Wenjie was still alive!</p><p>"Does Mayor Yang know what happens when a blade enters someone's throat?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taller than Yang Weimin by a head. At this moment, he lowered his head so that his eyes looked directly down at Yang Zhongmin's face. His warm breath brushed against Yang Zhongmin's skin, which felt as cold as icicles in midwinter, penetrating to the bone.</p><p>"The blade will first pass through the tonsils, cutting the oral cavity or trachea, then enter the esophagus and travel into the stomach. Along this path, all your organs will be slashed by the blade, bleeding profusely until your abdominal cavity is filled with blood..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke slowly, making Yang Zhongmin's limbs feel numb.</p><p>"The silver needles in my hand are even longer than blades; they will lodge in your throat, pierce through the esophageal wall, penetrate the gastric mucosa, enter the intestines, and remain embedded in the intestinal walls..."</p><p>Yang Zhongmin stared at Zhu Tianlei as if he were looking at a demon.</p><p>"Mayor Yang, you...please save me, Zhu Tianlei is crazy, he's crazy..."</p><p>Yang Zhongmin knew that nothing he said would make any difference; Zhu Tianlei wouldn't let him go. Therefore, all he could do was beg for help. Yang Wenjie couldn't just stand by and watch, right?</p><p>However, Yang Wenjie stood aside, his lips moved slightly but no words came out.</p><p>"Mayor Yang, should I insert the thirty silver needles one by one into your mouth or all at once?"</p><p>In the hall, hundreds of people watched Zhu Tianlei's treatment of Yang Zhongmin, yet not a single person stepped forward to speak up for him.</p><p>In fact, most people were secretly cheering. If there were more people like Zhu Tianlei in the world, would there be fewer corrupt officials?</p><p>"Mayor Yang, what do you think..."</p><p>Deng Chang had been standing among the crowd all along. In such a situation, it wasn't his turn to speak, and he clearly understood R Zhu Tianlei's status in Yang Wenjie's eyes from the incident at the Cliff of Decapitation, so he remained silent.</p><p>But now, Zhu Tianlei seemed to be going too far... a government official was being openly threatened by an ordinary citizen in broad daylight. If nothing were done, wouldn't that undermine the authority of the government?</p><p>Yang Wenjie didn't speak.</p><p>Deng Chang just shut up automatically.</p><p>Yang Zhongmin was isolated and helpless, calling heaven in vain and the earth unanswered.</p><p>"County Mayor Yang, have you made up your mind?"</p><p>"I......"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei tightened his grip, causing Yang Zhongmin's mouth to open involuntarily. A silver needle with a cold glint pressed against his chin.</p><p>"I will say it, I will say it......"</p><p>Yang Zhongmin was terrified.</p><p>By speaking, he at least had the chance to die quickly; being imprisoned would mean certain execution. If he didn't speak, those thirty silver needles piercing his stomach would make life unbearable.</p><p>"The leader is named Zhou Qiang and lives in the innermost courtyard of Ma Jia Hutong in Yunhai City....."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei released his hand, Yang Zhongmin's body went limp, and he immediately collapsed to the ground.</p>

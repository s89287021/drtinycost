						<p>Tan Daquan said he would kneel down immediately, scaring Zhu Quezi almost to his knees. What was going on? They had originally planned to find him, but it turned out they were looking for his son instead. But whether it was him or his son, neither could manage their daughter-in-law's childbirth! </p><p>Knowing one's father best, Zhutianlei couldn't see his father's expression but could guess what he might be thinking.</p><p>"Uncle Tan, when did Aunt Guilan fall ill?"</p><p>In the countryside, they call a woman giving birth 'falling ill.' Although Zhutianlei was a young bachelor, he still understood this.</p><p>Seeing Zhutianlei come out, Tan Daquan immediately got excited, as if he had seen the Bodhisattva of Mercy, which made Zhu Quezi feel only coldness.</p><p>"It started hurting early yesterday morning. He hasn't been able to give birth all day and night... If we delay any longer..."</p><p>Tan Daquan thought about his long-awaited grandson who might not survive, his heart aching like it was being pricked by needles.</p><p>"Then let's go. The sooner the better!"</p><p>Zhutianlei said to Tan Daquan, who didn't expect Zhutianlei to agree so quickly and became excited like he had been injected with adrenaline. Wiping away his tears, he turned and left the courtyard.</p><p>"Liezi, what are you doing?"</p><p>Zhu Quezi pulled at Zhutianlei's arm. He still didn't know about yesterday's incident in the gourd cave and instinctively thought his son was acting recklessly without knowing the severity of the situation.</p><p>"Dad, don't worry, I know what I'm doing!"</p><p>Zhutianlei gently patted his father's shoulder and followed Tan Daquan out of the gate.</p><p>"Ah, ah..."</p><p>Zhu Quezi tried to stop his son but Zhutianlei had already vanished at the gate. With his poor legs, he couldn't catch up and felt his heart racing with anxiety.</p><p>"Wife, go check on him quickly! This child better not get into trouble!"</p><p>Thinking for a moment, Zhu Quazi shouted at Hou Suxin, who was still cooking inside the house.</p><p>Hou Suxin, upon hearing her husband's words, paled and, without even wiping off the scallions in her hand, hurriedly ran to Tan Daque's home.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei followed Tan Daque directly into the courtyard. Immediately, a man in his late twenties rushed out of the house. Upon seeing Zhu Tianlei, his eyes filled with emotion and turned red.</p><p>This man was Tan Daque's second son, Tan Ming, whose wife had gone through a difficult childbirth.</p><p>"Leizi, my wife......"</p><p>"Ming Brother, don't worry, I'll go in right away!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not dawdle; after all, lives were at stake. It was often said that childbirth was akin to stepping one foot into the gates of death. Although he possessed divine medical skills, he still lacked confidence when it came to childbirth.</p><p>The moment he entered the room, a wave of bloodstained air greeted him.</p><p>Several women in their forties gathered around the bed. Upon seeing Zhu Tianlei enter, they all looked somewhat awkward.</p><p>After all, rural areas were different from cities where childbirth took place in hospitals and gender did not matter for the midwives or nurses. In rural areas, women gave birth with the help of midwives, and men were not allowed inside the room. Now, not only had a man entered, but it was also a young, unmarried man, so their awkwardness was understandable.</p><p>"What are you all standing around for? Idiots! Quickly let Tianlei examine Gui Lan; if something happens, who among you can take responsibility!"</p><p>Tan Daque's face darkened. The woman on the bed was his daughter-in-law, and he felt more twisted inside than anyone else, but what could be done? There was still his grandchild in her womb!</p><p>Upon hearing Tan Daque's severe words, the old women quickly got off the bed and leaned against one side, afraid of taking responsibility.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at Tan Ming's wife lying on the bed. Her face was as pale as paper, her lips devoid of color, and her body almost motionless. If not for the occasional muffled groans, she might have been mistaken for a corpse.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not take any chances. He reached out to feel Tan Ming's wife's wrist and sensed a faint pulse under his fingers. Images began to flash through his mind.</p><p>"Ming Brother, is there a needle in the house?"</p><p>"Needle?"</p><p>"Just any needle for sewing will do!"</p><p>"Yes, yes, yes!"</p><p>Tan Ming nodded rapidly and hurriedly took a large bag of embroidery needles from the basket on the counter.</p><p>"Heat these needles over fire until they are red, then bring them back to me!"</p><p>At that moment, Tan Ming's mind went blank, and without much thought, he rushed to do what Zhu Tianlei asked.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei held his breath, pressed his fingers on Tan Ming's wife's Shenting point, and slowly let his spiritual energy enter her body. This would at least help restore some of her strength. Giving birth without enough strength could be fatal.</p><p>"Here they come! Here are the needles!"</p><p>After a moment, Tan Ming returned with the embroidery needles that had been heated over fire. Zhu Tianlei took the needles and, following the positions and sequence in his mind, inserted them one by one into Tan Ming's wife's acupoints.</p><p>"What are you doing? This is going to kill her!"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei pricking Tan Ming's wife with needles, Tan Family's Aunt finally couldn't hold back.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei gave her a cold look.</p><p>"If you have the ability, go ahead and do it."</p><p>"You... "</p><p>Aunt was left speechless. Come on, she wasn't looking for trouble; if something happened to Tan Ming's wife, would he not skin her alive?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei slowly inserted the embroidery needles into thirteen acupoints on Tan Ming's wife's body. After the last needle was placed, Tan Ming's wife, who had been barely conscious, suddenly opened her eyes.</p><p>"I'm in pain, so much pain......"</p><p>Several women looked at Zhu Tianlei as if they had seen a ghost. Could this kid really be a ghost? The man just seemed on the verge of dying not long ago!</p><p>"Hurry up, hurry up! The baby's head is showing, Mrs. Tan Ming, use your strength! The baby will be out any moment!"</p><p>The midwife quickly knelt on the bed and stared at under Mrs. Tan Ming's body. The Tan family father and son were so nervous that they didn't dare to breathe.</p><p>"Waaah!"</p><p>A loud cry of a newborn echoed from the Tan family's house, shattering the quiet dawn of Toad Hollow Village.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the tiny, wrinkly baby in the midwife's hands and suddenly became so emotionally overwhelmed that he didn't know what to do. He was very happy, this happiness was something he had never felt in his twenty-two years of life.</p><p>"Lei Zi, thank you!"</p><p>Tan Ming glanced at his son, his gratitude evident. Tan Dajuang was already overwhelmed with emotion, tears streaming down his face, unable to speak a word.</p><p>"Ming Brother, congratulations on becoming a father!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sincerely offered his blessings. The birth of a new life seemed to also signify his own rebirth.</p><p>"Lei Zi, this child's life is thanks to you, why don't you give him a name?"</p><p>Tan Ming said it sincerely. Zhu Tianlei was somewhat flustered but thought about the Tan family's trust in him and carefully considered it.</p><p>"New Life, let's call him Tan Xingsheng!"</p>

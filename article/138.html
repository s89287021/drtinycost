						<p>"John, this might not be suitable. I'm just a rural hooligan and can't handle such responsibilities. Please ask Mr. Yang to arrange another doctor."</p><p>"Mr. Yang, I don't understand your country's system or the regulations of Yundai City's healthcare system, but I believe Dr. Zhu has excellent medical skills and good ethics. I trust him very much. I hope you understood my request just now."</p><p>John's words were not a negotiation; they were a statement that he had decided on Zhu Tianlei, and if Mr. Yang couldn't handle it, he would find another way.</p><p>Mr. Yang's hands clenched fiercely on his thighs as if only this could help him control the rage boiling inside him like magma.</p><p>"Mr. Yang?"</p><p>Seeing his leader show no reaction, John's expression became noticeably unpleasant. Xiao Yu then subtly approached Mr. Yang and whispered a reminder.</p><p>"Oh, since Mr. John has suggested it, I naturally have no objections. I didn't expect Dr. Zhu to be so skilled at such a young age; it seems the previous information was mistaken!"</p><p>After regaining his composure, Mr. Yang immediately changed the subject, withdrawing his earlier words.</p><p>"Mr. John, I was really afraid Mr. Yang might misunderstand me. I wonder if I can still see you at the county hospital next time you come."</p><p>Mr. Yang felt like he was about to choke on his frustration.</p><p>This Zhu Tianlei was too shameless. He had already backed down, but the other party was still pressuring him. However, John looked at him very seriously as if he shared similar concerns with Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Mr. Yang repeatedly told himself in his heart that he must stay calm, calm, and even calmer.</p><p>"Dr. Zhu is really humorous. I've already said it was a misunderstanding earlier. Young talents like Dr. Zhu are always welcome. We would be delighted to nurture him further. I'll arrange for Song Boyennian to process the formal medical qualification certificate for Dr. Zhu immediately to ensure he can shine in his role as a doctor."</p><p>Mr. Yang said with gritted teeth, his smile forced.</p><p>"If that's the case, then thank you, Mr. Yang. You are truly an excellent leader dedicated to the people. I hope Dayhe County will have more leaders like Mr. Yang, and its prosperity is just around the corner!"</p><p>"Dr. Zhu, you're too kind, I can't bear it... Mr. John, with Dr. Zhu's exceptional medical skills as your attending physician, I feel reassured. There are other matters to attend to in the county, so I must leave now!"</p><p>"Yang County Magistrate, go slowly!"</p><p>......</p><p>Yang Zhongmin came with great momentum but ended up hurting himself. Not only did he fail to take revenge, but he also inadvertently provided a chance for Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>When getting into the car, Yang Zhongmin punched the control panel hard, scaring Xiao Yu who had already started the vehicle. The steering wheel veered off course, and the car crashed into the barrier of a nearby construction site with a bang. The bumper was knocked off.</p><p>In the ward, Zhu Tianlei looked at John, and John looked back at Zhu Tianlei. Both of them burst into laughter simultaneously.</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei had refused John's request, it did not diminish John's admiration for him. They had plenty to talk about and seemed like an unlikely pair of friends.</p><p>Thanks to Zhu Tianlei's acupuncture and daily spirit energy treatments, John recovered at a miraculous speed. While others needed a month to heal their wounds, John was fully healed in just one week and could walk again.</p><p>This almost miraculous recovery spread throughout the entire county hospital until John left, still praising Zhu Tianlei and the magic of traditional Chinese medicine.</p><p>On the other hand, Song Baina learned that Yang Zhongmin had agreed to process a medical license for Zhu Tianlei. He took immediate action as he knew from his interactions with Yang Zhongmin and had heard whispers about their feud. Realizing the situation could change at any moment, Song Baina processed Zhu Tianlei's medical license right after John left.</p><p>Song Baina personally handed over the physician's qualification certificate to Zhu Tianlei. The two men, thirty years apart in age, shared similar emotions in their eyes.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded solemnly.</p><p>The certificate felt heavy in his hand like a boulder, making him realize he was truly no longer the same Zhu Tianlei of before.</p><p>Time passed swiftly.</p><p>In an instant, it was the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the lunar calendar.</p><p>Tianlei Pharmaceutical was adorned with flowers inside and out. Zhu Tianlei gave each of his one hundred and three employees a big red envelope.</p><p>Each person received two large boxes of beautifully packaged mooncakes, and they were given a three-day holiday.</p><p>Máo Yǔ was also urged by Zhū Tiānlěi to go home. The vast factory was left with only Zhū Tiānlěi and Zhāng Yúntao.</p><p>"Tiānlěi, go home. Your uncle and aunt must be waiting for you to have dinner!"</p><p>Zhāng Yúntao watched as Zhū Tiānlěi sat by the bed without any intention of leaving. She struggled internally for a long time before reason ultimately overcame her longing.</p><p>"Are you telling the truth?"</p><p>Zhū Tiānlěi raised an eyebrow, looking at Zhāng Yúntao with a half-smile that was neither a smile nor a frown.</p><p>"It... it's true. Please hurry home so your uncle and aunt won't worry..."</p><p>Zhāng Yúntao forced a smile onto her face, although the sadness in her eyes was well hidden, it still inadvertently showed through.</p><p>"Alright then, take care of yourself when you're alone. The canteen food is all prepared!"</p><p>"Yes, I'll be fine!"</p><p>As Zhū Tiānlěi disappeared from her line of sight, Zhāng Yúntao could no longer force a smile. She slumped down by the bed, burying her face in her palms as if only this way could she find momentary solace for her lonely soul.</p><p>She lived in a world that no one could imagine, a world filled with darkness and coldness from childhood to adulthood, with the only light being what Zhū Tiānlěi brought her. But she dared not be greedy; she understood that Zhū Tiānlěi had already given her so much, and she shouldn't wish for more.</p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p>Zhāng Yúntao maintained the same posture until her shoulders were sore and her arms numb before gradually raising her head.</p><p>The room was dimly lit.</p><p>The sun had set, and nightfall arrived.</p><p>On the fifteenth day of August, a night when the moon is full and people reunite, she found herself here, alone all by herself.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao rose groggily from her bed, not knowing where she wanted to go or what she wanted to do. She simply pushed open the door aimlessly.</p><p>However, the moment she pushed open the door, everything before her made her feel as if she had suddenly been transported to another world.</p><p>Her eyes were brimming with warmth, and tears trickled down her cheeks without warning.</p><p>Before her eyes, colors were splashing in all directions. Lights flickered around her, and the man who appeared countless times in her dreams stood smiling in the midst of the lights.</p><p>"Wuuuuuuu..."</p><p>Without any warning, Zhang Yuntao knelt on the ground and burst into sobs.</p>

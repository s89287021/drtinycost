						<p>"Big Sister, I think this polygonatum seems to have a problem. It doesn't look like it's wild, and the age is also suspicious!"</p><p>"How can that be?"</p><p>Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, Yue Xiumei reacted as if her tail had been stepped on, screaming out immediately. Afterward, she realized her attitude was problematic and added a forced smile.</p><p>"It’s impossible! This polygonatum was hand-picked by me from Horse Ear Mountain. Because the roots are so deep, it took me half a day to get it out. Look at these patterns here—crosshatching, evenly spaced, and the color is dark and shiny. It must be at least thirty-five years old."</p><p>The old man suddenly raised his voice and said loudly.</p><p>Yue Xiumei was startled by the suddenness of the situation and had no time to stop it.</p><p>"Hmm, Grandpa, you seem very knowledgeable about this; did you really pick this polygonatum?"</p><p>"Yes, I wandered around the mountain for several days before finding this big guy. My ancestors were all herbalists, so I'm very familiar with these things. I..."</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei and the old man continued to talk more, Yue Xiumei's anxiety grew stronger. She felt as if she saw a plump duck flying out of a hot oil pot.</p><p>No way!</p><p>Yue Xiumei steeled her heart; she absolutely would not allow this situation to occur.</p><p>"Big Brother, don't listen to his nonsense. This old man is just a scammer, unscrupulous in every way. I bought this polygonatum from a farmer half a month ago; it can’t be what he dug up."</p><p>Yue Xiumei was certain that Zhu Tianlei was inexperienced and the old man would not dare to speak out even if wronged. Therefore, she continued to defame the old man smoothly.</p><p>"Ms. Yue, you're slandering me! It's clearly you who deceived my item and framed me!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the old man, unexpectedly finding him quite wise; his words were powerful.</p><p>"Hmph, I frame you? Pah, I, Yue Xiumei, am renowned in this ginseng market for honesty in business. Don't say it's a root of polygonatum; even if a golden nugget was placed under my feet, I wouldn’t bat an eye."</p><p>"Big Sister, I think this polygonatum seems to have a problem. It doesn't look like it's wild, and the age is also suspicious!"</p><p>"How can that be?"</p><p>Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, Yue Xiumei reacted as if her tail had been stepped on, screaming out immediately. She then realized her attitude was problematic and forced a laugh.</p><p>"It’s impossible! This polygonatum was hand-picked by me from Horse Ear Mountain.

It doesn't look wild and the age seems suspicious!"</p><p>"How could that be?"</p><p>Yue Xiumei reacted sharply, as if her tail had been stepped on, screaming immediately. Realizing her inappropriate reaction, she forced a laugh.</p><p>"It’s impossible! This polygonatum was personally picked by me from Horse Ear Mountain. The roots are very deep, so it took me half a day to extract it. Look at the patterns here—they crisscross evenly and the color is dark and glossy, indicating that it's at least thirty-five years old."</p><p>The old man suddenly raised his voice and declared emphatically.</p><p>Yue Xiumei was taken aback by the suddenness of the situation and had no time to intervene.</p><p>"Hmm, Grandpa, you seem very knowledgeable about this; did you really pick this polygonatum?"</p><p>"Yes, I wandered around the mountain for several days before discovering this substantial root. My ancestors were all herbalists, so I'm quite familiar with these things. I..."</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei and the old man continued their conversation, Yue Xiumei's anxiety intensified, imagining herself as a plump duck flying out of a hot oil pot.</p><p>No way!</p><p>Yue Xiumei steeled her resolve; she would not allow this situation to unfold.</p><p>"Big Brother, don't believe his nonsense. This old man is just a scammer, unscrupulous in every way. I bought this polygonatum from a farmer half a month ago; it can’t be what he dug up."</p><p>Yue Xiumei was convinced that Zhu Tianlei was inexperienced and the old man would not dare to protest even if wronged. Thus, she defamed the old man smoothly.</p><p>"Ms. Yue, you're slandering me! Clearly, you who deceived my item are now framing me!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the old man, finding him surprisingly wise; his words were powerful and convincing.</p><p>"Hmph, I frame you? Pah, as a reputable figure known for honesty in business in this ginseng market, even if a golden nugget was placed under my feet, I wouldn’t bat an eye."</p><p>Yue Xiumei truly lived up to her reputation as a 'celebrity' in the ginseng and deer antler market; her tactic of stepping on others' heads to elevate herself was undoubtedly one in a million.</p><p>"You......"</p><p>"Miss, I came here to buy something and didn't want any trouble. Now it seems this Dangshen has some issues; I think I'll just leave without purchasing it......"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei's disappointed expression as he turned to leave, Yue Xiumei wished she could dismember Old Man Ganyou.</p><p>"Hey hey hey, little brother, look at you, so young. I've been running this store for over a decade, would I really stop doing business because of one Dangshen? They say that while monks can run away, their temples cannot; my little temple is right here. If there's any issue, come to the store and find me, okay?"</p><p>Yue Xiumei was too covetous of Zhu Tianlei this young prospect, so she used all her tricks to try and keep him.</p><p>"This...... How about this? Miss, I have a suggestion; what do you think?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression was spot-on, showing a mix of reluctance to let go and hesitation in buying.</p><p>"Tell me. As long as little brother can come up with something, I promise you'll be satisfied."</p><p>Hmph!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei snickered inwardly—keep me satisfied; just don't cry later.</p><p>"Now, this big shot says that you stole the item from him, making it his property, while Miss claims to have collected it from the countryside half a month ago. Since both of you have different stories, I can't make a judgment. How about we do this: I'll set a question for you two to answer and see who the item truly belongs to. Sound good?"</p><p>Yue Xiumei's heart skipped a beat; she had an instinctive feeling that she was being lured into a trap. However, upon seeing Zhu Tianlei's innocent face with no hint of deceit and Old Man Ganyou's mournful look like he had lost his wife, she immediately dismissed her suspicions.</p><p>"Sure, since little brother has suggested it, then I'll let you rest assured!"</p><p>Yue Xiumei glanced at the crowd gathered outside; they were all from the industry. After all, this was her domain, and if she threw a tantrum, she had the upper hand.</p><p>"Alright, Big Sister is truly a straightforward person. Then I'll lay my cards on the table here. If it turns out that the item really belongs to Big Sister, I’ll buy this Dendrobium with 80,000 yuan!"</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, Yue Xiume's eyes widened.</p><p>Eighty thousand!</p><p>She was indeed a green pea, a green pea from head to toe. Spending eighty thousand yuan on such a Dendrobium, hahaha!</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>There was no way she could refuse; it would make her look foolish.</p><p>"However, since we both agreed to prove that the item belongs to us respectively, it's somewhat like making a bet. How about this: I'll put up 20,000 yuan as the stake. If Big Sister wins, I’ll buy the Dendrobium for 100,000 yuan. If Master wins, then Big Sister has to return the Dendrobium to me, and moreover..."</p><p>Yue Xiume was stunned by Zhu Tianlei's proposed stake!</p><p>"Moreover, Big Sister will also have to compensate me 20,000 yuan. However, I think Big Sister has a good chance of winning; it just depends on whether Big Sister is willing to take the bet."</p><p>Yue Xiume was a mahjong enthusiast, an outstanding player who spent most of her time in mahjong parlors when she wasn't running her shop.</p><p>Like all die-hard mahjong players, Yue Xiume harbored a strong desire to win big. However, as a businessman, she was also sensitive and shrewd. She suspected this might be a trap, so she hesitated and struggled internally.</p><p>The onlookers watching the scene inside the room found it thrilling and exciting. As they say, those who watch for entertainment are not bothered by how big the event is. Moreover, Yue Xiume usually liked to take advantage of situations and was not well-liked among people, so when Zhu Tianlei spoke, everyone cheered her on to accept the bet.</p><p>Worst of all, Zhu Tianlei did what he said; he quickly pulled out two thick stacks of hundred-yuan bills from his pocket and slapped them down on the counter next to the Dendrobium.</p><p>The bills, pink paper currency, reflected a mesmerizing glow under the old-fashioned incandescent lights above, captivating everything beautiful in the world.</p><p>Yue Xiume swallowed hard, her mouth going dry.</p><p>"Alright, I'll take the bet!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's lips curled up into a sinister smile.</p><p>For a moment, Yue Xiume's heart tightened, but when she saw the pink luster on the counter, that tension instantly vanished.</p><p>"Now, let me ask my first question......"</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei spoke, the surrounding crowd immediately fell silent, all staring intently at him, creating an atmosphere of intense silence.</p><p>"How many upright hairs are there on the back of this root of Polygonatum?"</p><p>Yue Xiume was stunned; what kind of question was this?</p>

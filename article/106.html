						<p>"Mao Consultant?"</p><p>Mao Yu received the news and rushed to the hospital almost non-stop. She hadn't been there all day, so how could such an incident happen?</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, what exactly happened? Why was the construction site sealed off?"</p><p>Running over, Mao Yu's cheeks were flushed, and she was panting for breath.</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>Facing Mao Yu's questioning, Zhu Tianlei spoke honestly; he didn't have a definitive answer in his heart at that moment.</p><p>"You... are you really stupid or fake stupid? Why didn't you settle this privately? Do you know how complicated it would be to involve the administrative department? The construction schedule is there. If we can't complete it on time, construction will not be allowed this year. Have you thought about the consequences?"</p><p>Angered, Mao Yu's chest rose and fell, so she spoke without thinking.</p><p>Looking at Mao Yu, Zhu Tianlei's expression gradually darkened. How could he remain calm in such a situation?</p><p>"I am stupid, watching things happen helplessly. If I told you it was someone deliberately targeting me? Or if I told you someone wanted to frame me? Settling privately? Easier said than done, and why would I settle privately? It's not my fault; on what grounds should I bow down?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't help raising his voice and walked into the hospital without looking back.</p><p>Mao Yu clenched her fists, knowing that she had spoken harshly just now, but she was also anxious. After thinking for a moment, she stomped her foot and followed Zhu Tianlei into the hospital.</p><p>"The deposit for the hospitalization fee is 10,000. Go pay it!"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei come in from outside, Qi Lian pointed to the billing office and said to him.</p><p>"Captain Qi..."</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was about to speak, the wailing siren of an ambulance came from outside, followed by several medical staff pushing an ambulance quickly into the building.</p><p>"Time's up, we can't make it in time. The patient's heartbeat has stopped, let's place them in the emergency room first!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei heard one of the doctors say and then a few people pushed the ambulance to the nearby emergency room.</p><p>"Hurry up and pay!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei originally wanted to ask about the informant, but after what happened just now, he suddenly lost interest in asking. He directly reached into the window at the checkout counter and swiped his card to leave a deposit.</p><p>"Alright, let's find somewhere to wait for the results of the patient's examination first, then you come with me back to the station for an investigation."</p><p>Seeing that Zhu Tianlei had been fully cooperative throughout, Qi Lian's attitude became much more relaxed than before. He had met many private enterprise bosses, regardless of their age; there were plenty who would shirk responsibility and avoid it. It was rare to see someone like this young man taking responsibility. As a result, Qi Lian unconsciously developed a sense of appreciation.</p><p>"No way, the pupils are dilated, no breathing or heartbeat, there's no value in resuscitation!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the emergency room, hearing the doctors' discussions inside. Unconsciously, he stood up. Qi Lian looked at Zhu Tianlei in surprise, wanting to call him back, but for some reason, he couldn't utter a sound.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took steps towards the emergency room, where the doctors had already given up on resuscitation and were making emergency records, preparing to report the situation and arrange for the deceased's reception and handling.</p><p>Suddenly seeing a figure standing at the door, one of the young female doctors screamed in fright.</p><p>"Who are you? Why are you just standing there at the entrance?"</p><p>The doctor was startled and spoke without good manners.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the 'deceased' on the bed, it was an old lady around sixty years old, her face purplish, lips pale, dressed very simply.</p><p>"What are you doing?! "</p><p>Seeing that not only did Zhu Tianlei not leave, but he also entered the emergency room, the faces of several doctors were very unpleasant.</p><p>"This elderly person is still alive!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced over and said slowly,</p><p>"Still alive? Who are you? The machine can no longer detect a heartbeat or blood pressure. Don’t make things up, get out, get out. This is an emergency room; non-medical personnel are not allowed to enter."</p><p>One of the slightly older female doctors approached, grabbed Zhu Tianlei’s arm and tried to push him out, but she couldn’t budge him with one pull. The other doctors seeing this came over to help, but even all of them together couldn’t move Zhu Tianlei at all.</p><p>"She is not dead; I can revive her."</p><p>For some reason, Zhu Tianlei felt like there was something about this old woman that seemed to be attracting him, as if his actions were being guided, including his desire to revive her.</p><p>"Crazy! Quick, get him out. If the chief finds out, we’ll all be in big trouble.”</p><p>“Yes, our promotion reports are still with the chief!”</p><p>The doctors exchanged glances and moved towards Zhu Tianlei again.</p><p>"What are you doing? Is this an emergency room for making noise?"</p><p>A voice echoed in, and the doctors who were pushing Zhu Tianlei immediately fell silent. Zhu Tianlei turned around.</p><p>"It’s you?”</p><p>This chief was none other than Li Ping, whom he had briefly met before.</p><p>"Chief, this man is out of his mind. The patient has no heartbeat or blood pressure, yet he insists she’s not dead and can be revived. We……"</p><p>Hearing the junior doctor’s words, Li Ping’s eyes lit up.</p><p>"You say this old lady is not dead?"</p><p>"Not dead!"</p><p>"Great, since you said you can save her, she definitely won't die. That's a lot of trouble for you!"</p><p>Li Ping said hurriedly. Although he had previously trusted Zhao Zhiguo, he was not an amateur doctor; rather, his medical ethics were quite good. Therefore, hearing that the patient could still be saved made him overjoyed.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not refuse and directly placed his hand on the old lady's chest.</p><p>The doctors were all stunned. What was going on here?</p><p>Could their chief also have gone mad?</p><p>The person had clearly already lost all signs of life; unless Lord Yama erased her name from the Book of Life and Death, the deceased could not come back to life.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei completely ignored everyone's thoughts and focused solely on channeling his internal spirit energy into the old lady's body. Then, he took out a 'reviving pill' from his pocket and made the old lady put it in her mouth. Naturally, he followed with acupuncture.</p><p>At this moment, his hands moved as smoothly as clouds flowing in water, quickly inserting seventeen silver needles into various acupoints on the old lady's body. When the last needle was inserted, the 'corpse' lying on the bed suddenly let out a faint sigh.</p><p>"Ah! It's a fake death!"</p><p>The female doctor who had initially shoved Zhu Tianlei screamed in fear, her whole body trembling.</p><p>"Foolishness! What fake death? This is the patient waking up."</p><p>Li Ping glared angrily at the screaming nurse and looked at Zhu Tianlei with the eyes of someone gazing upon a deity.</p><p>"Grandma, are you awake?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said softly.</p><p>All the doctors in the room, except for Li Ping, became dumbfounded.</p>

						<p>Zhu Tianlei greedily stared at the patch of snow-white under Ma Lanlan's hands, its enormity making him feel that all the women he had seen in pornographic films before were fake.</p><p>"How huge it is!"</p><p>"Get lost! Get lost! You're not allowed to look!"</p><p>Although Ma Lanlan harbored an inexplicable fondness for Zhu Tianlei, her approval was one thing; having her body exposed by him was another matter entirely.</p><p>"Cough cough, okay, okay, I won't look, I won't look!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said it, but his eyes couldn't help glancing over. After seeing the murderous look in Ma Lanlan's eyes, he reluctantly turned his head, suppressing a huge surge of desire.</p><p>He gazed at his treasure jumping inside his pants with bittersweet emotions, wondering when his treasure would finally reveal its true splendor.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, why didn't you knock before coming in?"</p><p>After changing her clothes, Ma Lanlan angrily emerged from behind the curtain and stood abruptly in front of Zhu Tianlei, her face still flushed.</p><p>"How did you know I didn't knock? I not only knocked but also asked if anyone was inside."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the snow-white nurse's outfit Ma Lanlan was wearing. Although the uniform was conservative, the buttons at the neckline had been pushed apart slightly, revealing a tantalizing glimpse of something beautiful.</p><p>Lying outright, Zhu Tianlei could do so without changing his expression or breathing.</p><p>"That's impossible; I heard no sound at all."</p><p>Ma Lanlan was very sure.</p><p>"If you don't believe me, there's nothing I can do about it. But fortunately, it was me who came in. If it had been someone else... hmm!"</p><p>Just thinking about another man seeing that scene made Zhu Tianlei feel extremely uneasy.</p><p>Ma Lanlan noticed Zhu Tianlei's suddenly stern expression and was somewhat puzzled. She had been stripped of her dignity, hadn't she? Yet here came Zhu Tianlei with renewed interest?</p><p>"Hey, Lanlan, you... must have an E cup, right?"</p><p>"Pah, Zhu Tianlei, are you looking for a fight?"</p><p>Not long after they sat down, Zhu Tianlei once again leered at Ma Lanlan's chest, making wild guesses.</p><p>"What's to be afraid of? You'll belong to me sooner or later. I need to get to know you better so that I can buy you underwear and other things in the future."</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, shut up! If you say another word, I'll tell the village chief!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan was speechless at Zhu Tianlei's shamelessness and could only bring out the village chief, Yao Gang.</p><p>"Hmph, we're just a young couple having some spicy talk. Are you going to tell the village chief? Don't you fear being laughed at?"</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Ma Lanlan was so angry at Zhu Tianlei that her head hurt. She decided not to respond and focused on sorting out the new list of medicinal names.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled as he watched Ma Lanlan's flushed face and pouting, drooling lips, feeling that life couldn't get any better.</p><p>"Tianlei, Lanzi, go check quickly! Someone might be in danger! Wuuu..."</p><p>While Zhu Tianlei was engrossed in admiring the scenery, he was suddenly startled by someone barging in.</p><p>"Aunt Liu, don't cry. Calm down and tell me what's going on."</p><p>Ma Lanlan put down her pen and immediately got up to go towards Aunt Liu.</p><p>Moreover, the nephew of this Auntie Liu had married a cousin of Ma Lanlan, so the two families could be considered related by marriage. Therefore, apart from her regular duties as a doctor, Ma Lanlan also felt an extra layer of concern.</p><p>"My grandson got up early in the morning with a black face and wouldn’t wake up when called. Lanzi, Auntie, I only have this one grandson! If anything happens to him, I won’t be able to live either!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan’s heart tightened. The grandson Auntie Liu was talking about was Dogwa, who was eight years old, with a round face and very cute. Dogwa had been in good health since childhood and hadn’t even had a cold or fever in the past seven or eight years. How could he suddenly faint?</p><p>"Auntie Liu, stop worrying! Let’s go check on him right away!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan didn’t dare to delay. She reached into the cabinet to take out the emergency kit and was about to leave with Auntie Liu when she noticed that Auntie Liu wasn’t moving.</p><p>"Auntie Liu?"</p><p>"Let Tianlei go instead; his medical skills are high, he can even bring the dead back to life!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan’s face turned pale, feeling extremely embarrassed.</p><p>So Auntie Liu didn’t trust her medical skills. She recalled being the only doctor in Hagemao Village before, and everyone from inside and outside the village would smile and call her Ma Doctor whenever they saw her. But now, she had lost her standing in the hearts of the villagers, far behind Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Even Auntie Liu, who was usually close to her, thought so.</p><p>"Auntie Liu, without Lanlan’s help, my medical skills are at least halved. I can only feel confident in diagnosing when Lanlan goes with me."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood up, his expression rather stern.</p><p>Liu Shen’er didn’t understand; could medical skills be tied to someone?</p><p>But from what Zhu Tianlei said, he wanted her to go with him, no matter the reason.</p><p>"Lanzi, Auntie Liu is begging you! Please go check on him quickly. If we delay any longer, I’m afraid...”</p><p>Ma Lanlan originally felt quite bitter inside, but seeing Auntie Liu crying with tears streaming down her face, she couldn’t bear it anymore. Moreover, Zhu Tianlei had clearly been trying to comfort her and boost her morale just now, so she couldn’t help but feel grateful.</p><p>"Alright, Aunty Liu, let's go quickly!"</p><p>So, Aunty Liu led the way, followed by Zhu Tianlei and Ma Lanlan, as they hurried towards the western end of the village where Aunty Liu lived.</p><p>The moment they entered the courtyard, Zhu Tianlei inexplicably felt a cold aura emanating faintly from the house.</p><p>He knew that the cold aura was one form of illness or evil energy, just like the spirit energy within his body. However, while spirit energy healed, ill and evil energies did the opposite.</p><p>Upon entering the room, they saw a woman in her thirties sprawled on the kang (a traditional Chinese bed), weeping uncontrollably. Two men, one old and one young, stood by the edge of the kang with despondent faces, creating an oppressive atmosphere throughout the room.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the kang and noticed a little boy lying beside it, his complexion tinged with purple and cheeks swollen. His lips were almost black, making him look like he had been poisoned at first glance.</p><p>"Mom, Huizi is not going to make it... wuwu..."</p><p>Seeing Aunty Liu enter, the woman who was weeping uncontrollably on the kang stood up. Her voice was hoarse and her eyes swollen beyond recognition.</p><p>"Don't say such nonsense; my grandson's life is strong!"</p><p>Aunty Liu frowned at her daughter-in-law but tears were already streaming down her face as she turned to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Tianlei, Aunty, please help me... if anything happens to Huizi, this family will fall apart... Tianlei..."</p><p>Suddenly, Aunty Liu fell to her knees before Zhu Tianlei. The daughter-in-law standing beside them followed suit, causing Ma Lanlan's eyes to well up with tears.</p><p>"Aunty Liu, Sister-in-Law, please get up; I will do my best to save Huizi!"</p>

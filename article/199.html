						<p>Chen Fanglin, who was originally crouching among the crowd, was suddenly lifted by Zhu Tianlei after a shadow flashed past. Furthermore, Zhu Tianlei’s other arm was around Zhang Yuntao.</p><p>What kind of speed is this?</p><p>A gale? Lightning?</p><p>"Zhu...... Zhu Zhu Zhu......"</p><p>Chen Fanglin was completely terrified. Where were those fools? How could they let him fall into Zhu Tianlei’s hands? Didn’t they know that Zhu Tianlei was a cold-blooded killer who would not hesitate to kill?</p><p>"Chen Fanglin, I ask you, how did Xiao Gangpeng die?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei’s gaze did not carry any murderous intent; rather, it was as calm as a stagnant pond. However, Chen Fanglin felt like he was going to be killed in the next second and that his remains would be unidentifiable.</p><p>"It was him......"</p><p>Chen Fanglin just opened his mouth when a cold beam shot out from within the crowd, naturally directed at Chen Fanglin.</p><p>"Unaware of one’s own life!"</p><p>The beam was as swift as an arrow, leaving no time for any reaction.</p><p>"Tianlei!"</p><p>"Tianlei!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan and Yang Xiaoxue shouted simultaneously. Their young and beautiful faces were pale without a trace of color.</p><p>He was the man they loved most. Even though they knew he possessed extraordinary skills, their love could not tolerate even the slightest hint of danger.</p><p>However, before the two women’s voices had completely faded, the cold beam instantly struck Zhu Tianlei’s face.</p><p>The air was deathly silent.</p><p>Ma Lanlan and Yang Xiaoxue's hearts had crumbled into dust, not daring to look at Zhu Tianlei's handsome face as it appeared now.</p><p>"Suicide seeker."</p><p>Suddenly, Zhu Tianlei's voice echoed out, causing everyone's eyes to widen in shock.</p><p>This move of taking the dagger with his mouth astonished everyone present.</p><p>Among the crowd were many who had heard of Zhu Tianlei's reputation but had never seen him in action. At this moment, they had forgotten their true purpose for coming to watch the commotion. The world was silent, leaving only Zhu Tianlei standing alone and isolated.</p><p>Several dark figures in the crowd saw this scene and turned around, wanting to leave.</p><p>However, it was impossible for anything so cheap to happen, especially under Zhu Tianlei's watchful eye.</p><p>A sly smile appeared on Zhu Tianlei's lips as the dagger he had been holding in his mouth shot out, piercing one of the dark figures' calves with pinpoint accuracy.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>"Watch over her!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei carefully handed Zhang Yuntao in his arms to Yang Xiaoxue and Ma Lanlan, while he himself grabbed Chen Fanglin and took slow, steady steps towards the fallen dark figure.</p><p>In his path, a clear way was quickly made for him.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stopped beside the shadow.</p><p>"Who do you think you are to question me, this stinky brat? Listen up, Zhu Tianlei; don’t think that just because you’re so cocky, no one will dare touch you. Hmph, one day you’ll die a terrible death!"</p><p>The shadow lifted its head and revealed a middle-aged man with thick eyebrows and heavy eyes, his gaze flickering like a burning flame. This wasn’t someone hired for money to deal with him; at least not just that.</p><p>"Not my business?"</p><p>Hearing the man’s words, Zhu Tianlei suddenly laughed.</p><p>As an experienced Chen Fanglin immediately shivered in feigned agreement.</p><p>Whenever the Executioner killed, he would smile before striking, and the brighter his smile, the more terrifying his methods were.</p><p>Then, in front of everyone, Zhu Tianlei moved again. Several shadows that had already run out of the crowd felt a cold breeze brush past them, followed by their bodies rising off the ground and gliding on the wind.</p><p>Plop plop—several figures piled up in front of the man.</p><p>"Now you have no chance to speak!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the man whose leg was bleeding profusely. The world was never lacking in cowards, and opportunities didn’t always present themselves.</p><p>With that said, Zhu Tianlei left Chen Fanglin by the side of the crowd. He wasn’t afraid that Chen Fanglin would run; the other man lacked both the courage and ability to do so.</p><p>Next, he stepped on one of their hands.</p><p>"You only get one chance. Who sent you?"</p><p>"I......"</p><p>"Dali, if you speak up, we’re done from now on!"</p><p>Originally trembling, Dali was about to speak when he heard the man's words and hesitated. Zhu Tianlei curled his lips, and a crack sounded as all the bones in Dali's hand shattered.</p><p>A scream pierced through the clouds.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei lifted his foot and landed on another person's ankle.</p><p>"It's your turn!"</p><p>"I......I......"</p><p>This time, before the man could speak again, Zhu Tianlei's foot came down heavily, the sound of breaking bones clear to hear.</p><p>But this was not the end. This time, Zhu Tianlei's foot pressed against someone's chest.</p><p>"Speak."</p><p>He had no mercy for these people. Little Ganggang was only five years old and was about to celebrate his sixth New Year, but now he lay lifeless, frozen in time at five.</p><p>These people did not deserve to live.</p><p>"I'll talk, I'll talk, it's.....it's.....Yang Zhongmin!"</p><p>"Yesyesyes, it's Yang Zhongmin!"</p><p>Seeing someone speak up first, the others feared being tortured next and hurriedly agreed, afraid of falling behind.</p><p>Yang Zhongmin!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's knuckles cracked loudly.</p><p>Well, last time I let you off, not only did you not learn your lesson, but you dared to escalate things. Don't blame me, Zhu Tianlei, for not giving you a chance to live!</p><p>Watching the spectacle until now, everyone, including that initially harshly spoken man, had realized one thing: rumors, although mostly exaggerations of facts, were far less shocking than the truths surrounding Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"You all come with me!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said in a stern voice, looking at the people lying on the ground in various postures.</p><p>"Of course, if you think you can leave here, feel free to try!"</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei strode towards where Xiao Gangbeng's mother was located.</p><p>Although he had never seen Xiao Gangbeng's mother before, he had heard from Xiao Gangbeng that she was a gentle and kind woman, not only a good mother but also an excellent doctor.</p><p>At this moment, seeing this kind and gentle woman lying on the ground with a pale face and no hint of color in her cheeks, Zhu Tianlei felt his heart constricting with discomfort.</p><p>He knelt down and gently patted the woman's shoulder. The woman, who had been limp on the ground like a puppet, opened her eyes.</p><p>The confusion in her eyes lasted for not even a second before she again tried to rush towards Zhang Yuntao.</p><p>"Sis, calm down. I am Zhu Tianlei, Xiao Gangbeng's attending doctor. Please believe me; Xiao Gangbeng will not die in vain. I will make the mastermind behind this pay the price!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said quietly, looking at the woman.</p><p>His voice was not loud, but it miraculously calmed her agitated emotions.</p><p>"Can you really do that?"</p><p>"I swear with my life!"</p>

						<p>"Liei Ge?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei return, Yao Jianxiong was somewhat surprised.</p><p>"Jianxiong, who was that person just now?"</p><p>After entering the door, Zhu Tianlei asked.</p><p>"I don't know him either."</p><p>"Don't know him?"</p><p>"Yes, this person came before and said he was coming from elsewhere to collect mountain goods in Hamagou and wanted my dad to help arrange things in the village."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned. A person from elsewhere?</p><p>Hamagou is located deep in the mountains with poor transportation. Although it borders Big Green Mountain and Heihu Forest, there aren't many mountain goods. This person came all the way to collect mountain goods and even went straight to the village chief's house for help. There was something unusual about this matter.</p><p>"Liei Ge, when did this person come here for the first time?"</p><p>"It seems... it was around noon the day before yesterday!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei clenched his fist. No need to think, the person who put a curse was most likely that person just now.</p><p>However, since he had already been cursed, why would this person take the risk of coming again? Could there be other intentions?</p><p>"Liei Ge, you......"</p><p>Looking at Yao Jianxiong, Zhu Tianlei waved his hand.</p><p>"What did he say just now?"</p><p>Yao Jianxiong found it strange and couldn't understand why Zhu Tianlei was fixating on that person.</p><p>"I didn't say much, just asked if my dad is awake."</p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p>"Liezi older brother had already explained it before. I said I didn't understand what he meant. My dad was fine, went out, and he didn't say anything else and left. Liezi older brother, does this person have something to do with my dad's illness?"</p><p>Although Yao Jianxiong wasn't old, he was very smart and finally sensed something unusual from Zhu Tianlei's attitude.</p><p>"Good job, Jianxiong, like this......"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei whispered a few words into Yao Jianxiong's ear. Yao Jianxiong found it strange but didn't ask more questions, only nodding cautiously.</p><p>Night soon fell.</p><p>Yao's courtyard was silent. The crescent moon reflected on the water in the well, resembling scattered silver particles.</p><p>People in mountain villages went to bed early. Just after nine o'clock, the entire village had completely fallen into silence, except for the occasional hoots of night owls, there was no other movement.</p><p>A dark figure slowly approached Yao Gang's courtyard from far away, lingering by the wall for a while before suddenly climbing up the northern slope to the courtyard wall. The figure gracefully landed on the ground.</p><p>The dark figure first looked in the direction of Yao's main house, pressed close to the wall to listen for a moment, then quietly walked to the well and fished out a small bottle from his pocket. Under the bright moonlight, the contents inside the bottle were clearly visible—a tiny blood-red bug.</p><p>"Trying to leave?"</p><p>Just as the dark figure was putting away the small bottle and preparing to leave, the courtyard that had been in darkness suddenly lit up like broad daylight.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei and Yao Jianxiong came out from the side room door, looking at the black figure standing in the middle of the courtyard.</p><p>"Really you? You bastard, my dad has nothing against you. Why do you want to harm him!"</p><p>For the arrangement of Zhu Tianlei, Yao Jianxiong was initially skeptical. However, upon seeing the person in front of him, he knew that Zhu Tianlei was right; this man was the one who had harmed his father.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained silent, merely staring at the person before him.</p><p>This man had a narrow face with a slightly protruding chin. One eye had only white and no pupil, indicating it was a prosthetic eye. His hair was slightly grayish, his figure slender and somewhat hunched, giving him an air of malevolence that made it impossible to gauge his age.</p><p>"Humph!"</p><p>Although he was trapped in the courtyard, the newcomer showed no sign of nervousness. Instead, he let out a disdainful snort and moved swiftly towards the wall to leap over it.</p><p>"Getting in is easy, but getting out will depend on your skills!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei reacted instantly. Before the intruder could touch the courtyard wall, Zhu felt a chill breeze at his back, followed by pain in his shoulder as he was pushed to the ground.</p><p>He was utterly shocked!</p><p>The two individuals were initially about seven or eight meters away from him. Given his agility, he should have been able to escape in mere seconds, but the other party’s speed was astonishing. The force pressing down on his shoulder felt like a boulder and he could not break free.</p><p>"Tell me, why did you target Village Head Yao?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei got straight to the point without wasting any words.</p><p>"Why should I tell you anything?"</p><p>This person's voice was very hoarse, akin to an old gong, suggesting that his vocal cords had been damaged.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not fear him not speaking; he was merely curious. As long as this person was in his grasp, he already held the antidote for the poison.</p><p>It was just that he felt the matter might be more complicated than it seemed.</p><p>"Do you want my life? If I die, Yao Gang won't live either."</p><p>"Your thoughts are simple. Would I let you die?"</p><p>"Oh? So what do you intend to...?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei waved at Yao Jianxiong, who moved swiftly forward and scooped up half a ladle of water from the basin. In the water, red blood-sucking worms with finger-like bodies wriggled continuously, making one feel uneasy.</p><p>"What are you going to do?"</p><p>The visitor's face displayed a trace of shock.</p><p>"Bloodstiff Worms, after entering the body, rapidly dissolve blood and grow swiftly, reaching the brain in three days. The person doesn't die but becomes lifeless like a stiff corpse. Cultivators who raise Bloodstiff Worms always keep a distance from them. Do you know why?"</p><p>The visitor raised his head in astonishment, staring at Zhu Tianlei in disbelief.</p><p>"You... Who are you? How do you know these things?"</p><p>Yao Jianxiong had long hated this person to the point of grinding his teeth in anger. Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, he made no hesitation and was about to pour water on him with the ladle.</p><p>"You... No matter who you are, you'd better not touch me. Do you know who I am?"</p><p>"Do I need to know?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei retorted, as threats were either taken or ignored.</p><p>"You... I'm Tang Qingshan's second brother. If you dare to touch me, beware of dying a painful death!"</p><p>Tang Qingshan's second brother?</p><p>"Do you want my life? If I die, Yao Gang won't survive."</p><p>"Your thoughts are simplistic. Would I let you die?"</p><p>"Oh? So what do you intend to...?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei gestured to Yao Jianxiong, who swiftly approached and scooped up half a ladle of water from the basin. In the water, red bloodsucking worms with finger-like bodies wriggled continuously, making one feel uneasy.</p><p>"What are you going to do?"</p><p>The visitor's face displayed a trace of shock.</p><p>"Bloodstiff Worms: once inside the body, they rapidly dissolve blood and grow swiftly, reaching the brain in three days. The person doesn't die but becomes lifeless like a stiff corpse. Cultivators who raise Bloodstiff Worms always keep a distance from them. Do you know why?"</p><p>The visitor raised his head in astonishment, staring at Zhu Tianlei in disbelief.</p><p>"You... Who are you?

Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, he made no hesitation and was about to pour water on him with the ladle.</p><p>"You... No matter who you are, you'd better not touch me.

If you dare to touch me, beware of dying a painful death!"</p><p>Tang Qingshan's second brother?</p><p>The final translation is ready for use.</p><p>Jianxiong, who is Tang Qingshan? Is his official rank higher than your father's?</p><p>The most embarrassing thing about bragging is when you blow your own horn but the other person doesn't give a damn. This was how Tang Huangshan felt at that moment.</p><p>"Tang Qingshan...... are you from our hometown?"</p><p>Upon hearing Jianxiong Yao's words, he suddenly had an epiphany and said this.</p><p>"Hmph, kid, I'll admit you've got some knowledge!"</p><p>Tang Huangshan managed to salvage a bit of his dignity, but before he could get too excited, he felt a sharp pain in his wrist. Zhu Tianlei, who had seemingly picked up a two-inch dagger at some point, slashed Tang Huangshan's arm without any warning, drawing blood.</p><p>"Jianxiong, tie him up! We'll talk to your dad when he wakes up!"</p>

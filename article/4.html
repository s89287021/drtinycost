						<p>Ma Lanlan glared at Hu Daniao, feeling her face burning hot. However, for some reason, a strange sensation seemed to quietly emerge in her heart.</p><p>"Hmph, a blind cat meeting a dead rat!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan snorted disdainfully and squirmed out of the crowd. Zhu Tianlei looked at Ma Lanlan's full, firm bottom, swallowing hard.</p><p>"Oh my God, Zhu's brat seems like a god! He can even bring someone back to life!"</p><p>"That's right, I never would have guessed that Tianlei is actually so well-concealed! Haha!"</p><p>Facing the villagers who turned on him as fast as turning over a book, Zhu Tianlei remained unfazed. Taking advantage of others and throwing them down when they were in trouble was just part of human nature.</p><p>"Uncle Hu, tell us, how did you fall off Windy Cliff?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke while intentionally casting his gaze towards Chen Guafu's direction. Hu Daniao immediately followed his gaze, his eyes widening upon seeing Chen Guafu lying on the ground.</p><p>"It was that little slut Chen Guafu! Damn it, she pushed me off Windy Cliff when I wasn't paying attention!"</p><p>Thinking about how that slut dared to attack him, Hu Daniao wished he could rush over and tear her pants apart.</p><p>Once Hu Daniao finished speaking, the villagers in the gourd cave were somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>The person who was supposed to be dead turned out to be alive. The one accused of murder became a life-saver. The witness who claimed to have seen the murderer now stood accused as the killer himself.</p><p>"Hmph, that little slut kept pestering me, trying to get me to arrange her a job in the factory. I told her that we don't lack workers right now and would give her a job when we do. Damn it, this little slut changed completely once she got dressed, turning on me directly. I never expected her to be so strong and push me down all of a sudden!"</p><p>Hu Daniao was single, so he wasn't afraid to reveal the truth, spilling everything like a bamboo tube.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained silent, crossing his arms and watching everyone's reactions with amusement. It really was quite a spectacle.</p><p>He took another look at Chen Guafu, who was still unconscious, and sneered inwardly. He wondered what reaction Chen Guafu would have once she woke up.</p><p>When Hu Laomao saw that her son was fine, her heart was at ease. However, upon hearing that Chen Guafu had done this, the anger that had been directed at Zhu Tianlei immediately shifted towards Chen Guafu.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood up and slowly walked to Chen Guafu's side. Hu Dainiu, with the help of his nephew, moved over as well. His eyes wandered around Chen Guafu's chest, and he cursed her inwardly several times as a slut.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei squatted down and glanced at the two barely visible objects on Chen Guafu's chest. Suddenly, he recalled the sensation of touching these two fleshly parts in the cave. Unseasonably, his lower body became aroused.</p><p>He swallowed without a trace, trying to suppress his desire, and reached out to press on Chen Guafu's Renzhong point and Zhongfu point, allowing spiritual energy to slowly enter her body through these acupoints.</p><p>Soon, Chen Guafu slowly opened her eyes.</p><p>"You... are you a human or a ghost..."</p><p>The moment Chen Guafu opened her eyes, she saw Zhu Tianlei. Her heart raced again. She had personally confirmed that Zhu Tianlei was dead; what on earth was going on?</p><p>"Chen Saozi, you really have guts to throw such a big rock down just like that... truly..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei put on an expression of extreme wrongness. He naturally had a baby face, and coupled with being splashed with sewage earlier, this expression made people despise Chen Guafu even more.</p><p>"What are you talking about? It was clearly you who pushed Hu Dainiu off the Lookout Cliff! You also wanted to kill me to silence me. If it weren't for me running away..."</p><p>At that moment, Chen Guafu suddenly saw Hu Dainiu standing by with bloodshot eyes and shuddered. What on earth was going on? Why were both of them still alive?</p><p>Now...</p><p>"You slut, dare to harm my father!"</p><p>Hu Daniu had previously endured, but upon hearing Old Mrs. Chen's words, his anger boiled over immediately. He pushed away his nephew and pounced on Old Mrs. Chen, slapping her across the face hard enough to make half of her face swell up.</p><p>Inside the cave, none of the several dozen people stepped forward to intervene. For those who wanted to take a life, it was more than understandable if they slapped someone; stripping them naked and parading them through the streets would be considered acceptable too.</p><p>"Uncle Hu, you're injured now, don't keep agitating yourself. We can talk about this back in the village!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stepped forward with a faint smile on his face and said calmly.</p><p>"Alright, Lei, if it weren’t for you, Uncle Hu's life would be over. Don't worry, from now on, my life, Hu Daniu's, is yours, Zhu Tianlei’s!"</p><p>Hu Daniu had a fiery temper but was not a bad person. There were few in the village who could win his approval, and even Yao Gang had to give him some face. This statement was unprecedented.</p><p>The villagers now looked at Zhu Tianlei with new eyes. They thought this young man was truly remarkable—skilled in medicine, composed under pressure, and broad-minded. He was practically a role model for Hamaogou Village!</p><p>The group marched out of Hulu Cave in grand fashion. Old Mrs. Chen no longer enjoyed her previous treatment; two old women carried her away, dragging her down the mountain. They had always despised this fox, and now that they had the chance, they did not waste it, twisting her arms until they were black and blue. Yet, Old Mrs. Chen dared not make a sound.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei walked through the crowd with great composure, only unconsciously swallowing when his eyes caught Ma Lanlan's swaying behind.</p><p>Humph, he would pin this wench down under him someday. Soon!</p><p>By the time everyone returned to the village, it was dinnertime. However, compared to eating, everyone preferred watching the spectacle.</p><p>Yao Gang was fuming with suppressed anger, and Li Fugui was nearly apoplectic, feeling betrayed by Old Mrs. Chen. This made him wonder how he could face the villagers, especially in front of Limping Zhu. Seeing Old Mrs. Chen leaning against the village committee wall, he hated her so much that his teeth ached.</p><p>"Old Mrs. Chen, do you have anything to say?"</p><p>The whole village was present, and Yao Gang had to provide an explanation, especially to the injured Hu family and Ruan family.</p><p>"I... I didn't know they weren’t dead..."</p><p>Old Mrs. Chen spoke the truth—if she had known they were alive, she wouldn't have acted that way. However, what everyone heard did not align with the reality.</p><p>Hu Daniu had previously endured patiently, but hearing Old Mrs. Chen’s words made his anger boil over instantly. He pushed away his nephew and lunged at Old Mrs. Chen, delivering a vicious slap that immediately swelled half of her face.</p><p>Inside the cave, none of the several dozen people attempted to intervene. For those who sought to harm someone, a simple slap was nothing; stripping them naked and parading them through the streets would be considered acceptable as well.</p><p>"Uncle Hu, you’re injured now, don’t keep agitating yourself. We can talk about this back in the village!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stepped forward with a faint smile on his face and said calmly.</p><p>"Alright, Lei, if it weren’t for you, Uncle Hu’s life would be over.

Are you a pebble that jumped out of a rock?"</p><p>Fat Auntie was the first to charge forward; the nickname 'Toad Gully Village Megaphone' lived up to its name.</p>

						<p>After listening to Qiao Kuang's words, Zhu Tianlei's expression also turned serious.</p><p>At that very moment, a flash of inspiration struck his mind, revealing a disease name he had never encountered before.</p><p>"Uncle Qiao, I feel what you said is not entirely impossible. To be on the safe side, I suggest we treat your illness as an infectious disease, but......"</p><p>"But what?"</p><p>"It might be difficult for you."</p><p>Qiao Kuang smiled slightly and waved it off nonchalantly.</p><p>"You Uncle Qiao have experienced many things; everything should take precedence over the greater good. Better to kill ten thousand innocents than let one guilty person escape!"</p><p>While Qiao Kuang's words about killing ten thousand referred to the possibility of an infectious disease, Zhu Tianlei still felt a surge of excitement upon hearing them.</p><p>"Alright, then I'll talk to Aunt Mao and President Wei later."</p><p>Given the suddenness of the situation, Zhu Tianlei did not elaborate further with Qiao Kuang. If things were as Qiao Kuang suspected, their circumstances might be extremely grim.</p><p>However, before Zhu Tianlei could find Mao Fang, he saw Li Ping gasping for breath as he ran over from one side of the corridor, accompanied by another person. Zhu Tianlei took a closer look and recognized it as Li Yong, whom he had briefly met before.</p><p>"Tianlei, hurry to the emergency room and check on them. We've already received three patients this noon with symptoms identical to Secretary Qiao's."</p><p>Li Ping only learned of Qiao Kuang's true identity that morning from Wei Baoguo. He previously knew that Qiao Kuang was a mysterious and formidable figure but never imagined he would turn out to be the provincial secretary of Yunhai.</p><p>Upon hearing Li Ping's words, Zhu Tianlei's heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Could Qiao Kuang's words come true?</p><p>"Alright, hurry!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not dare to be careless; he even didn't have time to chat with Li Yong. He merely nodded, and the three of them hurried towards the emergency center.</p><p>As soon as they arrived at the entrance of the emergency center, they saw a nurse running out in a panic, almost colliding with Zhu Tianlei who was walking straight ahead.</p><p>"What are you doing, clumsy? You're supposed to be a medical worker. Running around wildly in a hospital is not acceptable!"</p><p>Li Ping looked very polite, but when he got angry, his presence could be quite intimidating.</p><p>The nurse's face immediately lit up with surprise upon realizing whom she had bumped into.</p><p>"Director Li, the patient is foaming at the mouth and seems to be dying!"</p><p>"Nonsense!"</p><p>Li Ping understood what the nurse was trying to say, but the emergency center was filled with people. Such statements could damage their department's reputation or even tarnish the entire city hospital's image if overheard by family members. That was why Li Ping reprimanded her.</p><p>"Director Li, right now, please evacuate all staff from the medical room and carefully count everyone who has participated in the emergency treatment. Gather these personnel in one place; until their condition is confirmed, no one should leave the hospital."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned around and said to Li Ping.</p><p>Li Ping's face instantly paled.</p><p>He was an experienced doctor, and Zhu Tianlei's words immediately made him realize the severity of the situation.</p><p>There were more than ten participants in the emergency treatment, including several highly qualified experts. Without concrete evidence, isolating these people would be hard to justify and explain to other departments.</p><p>"It's too late; go ahead and do it. If anything happens, I'll take responsibility!"</p><p>Li Ping was still hesitating.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Li Yong, and a hint of surprise flashed across his mind.</p><p>This man does not seem to make a big show of himself, but in critical moments, he remains calm and composed, showing great responsibility, which is truly impressive.</p><p>"Alright then, I will go arrange it now."</p><p>Li Ping glanced at Li Yong and saw Zhu Tianlei nod lightly. He stomped his foot and turned around to rush into the emergency room. Soon, three doctors wearing white coats were brought out from the emergency room.</p><p>Nurse Manager Zhao, you have twenty years of nursing experience; I believe this task is in capable hands.</p><p>Li Ping called over Nurse Manager Zhao Xin, entrusting this monumental task to this mature and reliable middle-aged woman, who was also his trusted partner.</p><p>"Rest assured, Mr. Li, I will not disappoint your trust!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt deeply moved by Li Ping's and Li Yong's trust and cooperation. Trust is hard to come by; it's more valuable than gold.</p><p>"Mr. Li, you don't need to go in right now. From now on, the emergency room will no longer accept new patients. If there are any urgent cases, please coordinate with other departments or the municipal emergency center to arrange for nearby hospitals."</p><p>"Tianlei, I still want to go in with you; after all, there are three patients!"</p><p>"It's not necessary, Mr. Li. After I go inside, I will likely be living and eating with the patients for a short period. The doctors and nurses who have come into contact with the patients need your care. If anyone falls ill, please inform me immediately. You two also need to quarantine together."</p><p>Li Ping and Zhao Xin exchanged looks and nodded solemnly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pondered for a moment before stepping into the emergency room and closing the door behind him.</p><p>A single door separated the world into two halves.</p><p>Li Yong stood in front of Wei Baoguo, carefully recounting Zhu Tianlei's doubts and arrangements.</p><p>"It's impossible. It's autumn now, not the peak season for infectious diseases. Besides, making such a judgment based on just a few similar cases seems too hasty. You need to understand that if this isn't true, the consequences could be catastrophic, even causing social panic..."</p><p>Wei Baoguo's first reaction was disbelief.</p><p>Apart from that large-scale nns virus outbreak ten years ago, there had never been any similar cases.</p><p>That nns virus, that white terror, that war without smoke, still gave him chills whenever he thought about it.</p><p>So, his initial reaction was also driven by fear.</p><p>"Director, have you considered the possibility that Dr. Zhu's doubts are true? Back then, we were both witnesses to the nns outbreak. Imagine if we had isolated patients as soon as the virus was discovered, perhaps the virus wouldn't have spread so wildly, affecting twenty-one provinces and municipalities, with over 600,000 people infected and daily deaths due to ineffective treatment... among them, not only patients but also our colleagues..."</p><p>Li Yong's girlfriend, that innocent and adorable girl, had her life taken by that nns virus.</p><p>Tens of years have passed, and he has already married and had children. However, the image of his first love is still vivid in his mind, making him hate nns with a passion. Therefore, upon learning about the patients at the emergency center, his immediate thought was of an infectious disease.</p><p>But being insignificant, until Zhu Tianlei appeared and made those statements.</p>

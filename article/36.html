						<p>Amidst the crowd, a sturdy middle-aged woman burst out, cursing the fat auntie and reaching towards Ma Lanlan to grab her, one hand almost touching Ma Lanlan's collar.</p><p>"You... who are you? Daring to obstruct me, Li Daicui?"</p><p>Just as Li Daicui's hand was about to touch Ma Lanlan, it was seized by someone.</p><p>"I am Ma Lanlan's colleague. If you have something to say, speak up properly; if not, leave!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was already in a bad mood and now had to deal with Li Daicui causing trouble at the clinic and even attacking Ma Lanlan. This situation perfectly matched his volatile temper.</p><p>The villagers watching saw it was Zhu Tianlei and immediately calmed down.</p><p>No matter how capable Li Daicui was, she couldn't match Zhu Tianlei!</p><p>In the eyes of Hagemao Village's residents, Zhu Tianlei had become a treasure for the village. Wherever Zhu Tianlei went, he brought stability like an anchor, solving any problems.</p><p>"Spit! You snakes and rats, all the same; you good-for-nothings! Ma Lanlan, you little slut, you killed my man, I'll make sure you don't die easily either. Today, Li Daicui will risk her life to ensure neither of you have a good time!"</p><p>Li Daicui had originally come to find Ma Lanlan for revenge but was unexpectedly stopped by Zhu Tianlei. Thus, she naturally added Zhu Tianlei to her list of enemies.</p><p>Ma Lanlan looked at Li Daicui in confusion; when did she kill Li Daicui's man?</p><p>Originally, Li Daicui and her husband were not from Hagemao Village but from the neighboring Jiaoma Village. However, two nights ago, Li Daicui suddenly knocked on Ma Lanlan's door, saying her man had severe diarrhea and their village clinic lacked medicine. So, she took a box of diarrhea medication from Ma Lanlan.</p><p>One box of diarrhea medication, produced by a legitimate factory, how could it kill someone?</p><p>"Mrs. Li, I only gave you a box of diarrhea medication; how can you say I killed your man? The medicine was produced by a reputable factory, and the villagers in our village have used this medicine for diarrhea over the past two years with no issues. You..."</p><p>"Spit! You little slut, you had malicious intentions; my man took the medicine you gave him and not only didn't get better but is now on his last breath. You will pay for murder; give me back my man's life!"</p><p>After saying this, Li Daicui tried to grab Ma Lanlan with her other hand. Zhu Tianlei could no longer tolerate it and tapped Li Daicui's shoulder. Li Daicui screamed and half of her body went numb, causing her to sit on the ground.</p><p>"Oh my God, I, Li Dacui, don't want to live anymore. If you have the guts to kill me, go ahead, because I don't want to live either! Come on, kill me..."</p><p>Li Dacui sat on the ground, cursing and sobbing uncontrollably. Zhu Tianlei's face remained stern as he coldly observed her antics.</p><p>"Mrs. Li, you say I killed someone, but I won't accept that. Where is my brother? Let me go check!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan had always been strong-willed and bold since she was young. Facing Li Dacui's unruly behavior, she quickly calmed herself after a moment of panic.</p><p>You catch the thief with evidence, you catch an adulterer in flagrante delicto; if they say I killed someone, there needs to be proof!</p><p>"The person is right over there. If you want to see, go look! Look now! If you don't give me an explanation today, Li Dacui will crash into the clinic entrance!"</p><p>Li Dacui pointed, and Zhu Tianlei and Ma Lanlan only then noticed a cart parked at the clinic entrance, with one person on it. They didn't expect Li Dacui to bring someone there.</p><p>Ma Lanlan and Zhu Tianlei exchanged glances before quickly approaching the cart. The other villagers were all excited about the commotion and followed along.</p><p>Li Dacui stopped crying and abruptly stood up, crawling over to the side of the cart as if fearing that Zhu Tianlei and Ma Lanlan would take action.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei and Ma Lanlan saw the state of the person on the cart, they exchanged a look. The man's face was purple, his cheeks swollen, and his lips black.</p><p>It matched Huzi's symptoms!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was shocked and immediately reached out to feel the man's pulse.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei reach out, Li Dacui pounced on the man like a famished tiger, glaring at Zhu Tianlei and shouting.</p><p>"Help me!"</p><p>"I spit! You two dogs, with hearts as black as your souls! My man is barely alive. What help do I need from you scoundrels?"</p><p>"Oh my God, I, Li Dacui, don't want to live anymore. If you have the guts to kill me, go ahead, because I don't want to live either! Come on, kill me..."</p><p>Li Dacui sat on the ground, cursing and sobbing uncontrollably. Zhu Tianlei's face remained stern as he coldly observed her antics.</p><p>"Mrs. Li, you say I killed someone, but I won't accept that. Where is my brother? Let me go check!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan had always been strong-willed and bold since she was young. Facing Li Dacui's unruly behavior, she quickly calmed herself after a moment of panic.</p><p>You catch the thief with evidence, you catch an adulterer in flagrante delicto; if they say I killed someone, there needs to be proof!</p><p>"The person is right over there.

You two dogs, with hearts as black as your souls! My man is barely alive. What help do I need from you scoundrels?"</p><p>"Oh my God, I, Li Dacui, can no longer bear to live. If you have the courage to kill me, go ahead, for I have no desire to continue. Come on, take my life..."</p><p>Li Dacui sat on the ground, her curses mingling with sobs as Zhu Tianlei watched her with a stern expression.</p><p>"Mrs. Li, you accuse me of murder, but I will not accept it. Where is my brother? Let me go see!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan had always been strong-willed and decisive from a young age. In the face of Li Dacui's unruly behavior, she quickly regained her composure after an initial moment of panic.</p><p>To catch a thief, you need evidence; to catch someone in adultery, you must find them in the act. If they claim I murdered someone, there needs to be proof!</p><p>"The person is right over there. If you want to see, go look! Look now! If you don't give me an explanation today, Li Dacui will crash into the clinic entrance!"</p><p>Li Dacui pointed, and Zhu Tianlei and Ma Lanlan saw a cart parked at the clinic entrance with one person on it. They had not expected Li Dacui to bring someone there.</p><p>Ma Lanlan and Zhu Tianlei exchanged glances before quickly approaching the cart. The other villagers were all drawn by the commotion and followed along.</p><p>Li Dacui stopped crying and abruptly stood up, crawling over to the side of the cart as if fearing that Zhu Tianlei and Ma Lanlan would take action.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei and Ma Lanlan saw the state of the person on the cart, they exchanged a look. The man's face was purple, his cheeks swollen, and his lips black.</p><p>It matched Huzi's symptoms!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was shocked and immediately reached out to feel the man's pulse.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei reach out, Li Dacui pounced on the man like a famished tiger, glaring at Zhu Tianlei and shouting.</p><p>"Help me!"</p><p>"I spit! You two dogs, with hearts as black as your souls! My man is barely alive. What help do I need from you scoundrels?"</p><p>Li Dacui waited for Ma Lanlan and Zhu Tianlei with a vicious look, wishing she could tear them apart alive.</p><p>"Li Dacui, this Zhu Tianlei is our Hama Gou's miracle doctor, capable of reviving the dead. Who knows, he might actually be able to save your husband!" </p><p>"That's right, let Tianlei take a look. If you keep blocking him now, you'll regret it later!"</p><p>"Pah, he's a miracle doctor? If he is, I Li Dacui am the Bodhisattva Guan Yin! You don't need to egg me on; if my husband dies, none of you will get off scot-free!"</p><p>Li Dacui acted like a mad dog, attacking anyone who crossed her path. Those who had originally wanted to speak up for her changed their minds and remained silent.</p><p>The atmosphere tensed up.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at Li Dacui, suddenly turned around, pulled Ma Lanlan, and entered the clinic, locking the door with a click.</p><p>"Tianlei... isn't this a bit too much?"</p><p>Ma Lanlan felt uneasy because her husband was still on the cart outside. Regardless of whether his illness had anything to do with her, in recent years, she had developed a sense of professionalism as a doctor and couldn't bear to ignore his life and death.</p><p>"What's wrong with that? She cursed you like that; she deserves it!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan's initial nervousness and guilt vanished upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words. She felt warm and sweet inside.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was upset because of her!</p><p>Knowing that someone cared for and protected her made Ma Lanlan's previously naive heart stir with an unprecedented sense of happiness.</p><p>"You two won't have a good end, thinking I Li Dacui can do nothing just because I've locked the door?"</p><p>Li Dacui continued to scream outside, while Zhu Tianlei idly flipped through patient files in the metal cabinet, ignoring her shouts.</p><p>"Rustle!"</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan's scream and the loud shattering sound echoed simultaneously. Zhu Tianlei suddenly turned around to see a pile of broken glass in front of Ma Lanlan, the clinic window had been smashed by Li Dacui!</p><p>What the hell!</p><p>This woman has gone mad!</p><p>"Are you hurt?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sprinted to Ma Lanlan's side and anxiously examined her up and down, relieved that Ma Lanlan was unharmed.</p><p>However, his gaze towards Li Dacui outside the window had lost all warmth!</p><p>"What are you doing? What are you doing? Can't you find something to do? Have you finished working in the fields?"</p><p>At this moment, Yao Gang rushed over from the village office, his temper flaring when he saw that the clinic's glass had been broken.</p><p>One by one, none of them ever brought him peace of mind. Being a village chief felt like being a kindergarten teacher; these women, whether with or without reason, were cursing and fighting, and even smashing glass.</p>

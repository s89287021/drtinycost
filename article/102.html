						<p>Half an hour later, Zhu Tianlei retracted his gaze but had no heart to continue meditating in the cave. A thought flashed through his mind, and he took a different path down the mountain.</p><p>Currently, Zhu Tianlei's walking speed was astonishing; with all his might, he could reach his destination in ten minutes instead of the original forty-five minutes.</p><p>Therefore, when Zhu Tianlei stood at Qin Ming's doorstep, only twenty minutes had passed.</p><p>Inside the cave, the person who had taken five thousand yuan from the other party was Qin Ming, a notorious villain in Hamagou Village.</p><p>Qin Ming is forty-one years old. He married a woman from another village at thirty, but to his surprise, she left silently after just one year, unable to endure Qin Ming's treatment, and was never heard from again.</p><p>Qin Ming searched for her for half a year before giving up, as he found it better not to have a wife at home. This way, he could roam freely, seeking pleasure wherever he went.</p><p>Not only in Hamagou but within a radius of dozens of miles, there wasn't a single young girl or married woman who didn't fear Qin Ming.</p><p>Qin Ming was bold and shameless to an extreme extent, often sneaking into people's yards to peek at them bathing, even witnessing couples engaging in intimate activities. One year, he nearly got killed by a man from the neighboring village because of this.</p><p>Despite all that, Qin Ming continued his reckless behavior as usual.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei never thought he would have anything to do with this person one day, truly illustrating how unpredictable life could be.</p><p>Half an hour later, Qin Ming whistled while sauntering to his doorstep. However, just as he was about to open the door, he suddenly felt a cold wind brushing past his back.</p><p>"Damn it, what evil wind is this in the middle of summer!"</p><p>Qin Ming muttered under his breath before closing the courtyard gate and turning around.</p><p>"You... you... how did you get in here?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei standing before him, Qin Ming was so frightened that he stuttered uncontrollably.</p><p>"Qin Ming, where were you?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Qin Ming and asked with a smile, "W-Where am I going? Is that any of your business?"</p><p>Qin Ming was indeed nervous, but upon reflection, he realized that after coming out of the gourd cave, he had rushed directly home without delay. Zhu Tianlei could not possibly know about his trip to the cave, so his frantic heart gradually calmed down.</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei blinked and suddenly reached out, his hand as swift as lightning to grab the envelope from Qin Ming's chest before he could react.</p><p>"What are you doing? Give it back to me!"</p><p>Qin Ming was so scared his voice changed. He tried to snatch the envelope back but there was no way he could match Zhu Tianlei in a fight.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned around and tore open the envelope.</p><p>A thick stack of pink banknotes shimmered under the sunlight.</p><p>"Qin Ming, wow, this stack is even consecutive, must be about 5000?"</p><p>Qin Ming's heart trembled.</p><p>How could Zhu Tianlei know it was 5000? Did he really hear Qin Ming and that person talking?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, give me the money back! Hurry up!"</p><p>Qin Ming jumped again trying to reclaim the envelope; the money was still fresh in his hands!</p><p>"Qin Ming, don't you want to tell me where you got this 5000?"</p><p>"What do I owe you for telling you who I am? This money is what I earned, got it?"</p><p>Having been a rascal and rogue for over ten years, Qin Ming was no pushover when it came to courage, face-saving tactics, or wits.</p><p>"Earned? How did you earn it, by spreading rumors and passing on information?"</p><p>Qin Ming could already determine that Zhu Tianlei had heard their conversation in the cave, but what difference did that make? Catching a cheating spouse required solid evidence. Without proof, Zhu Tianlei would remain unconvicted even if he refused to admit it.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, stop slandering me. Listen carefully; just because you've been bragging around the village recently doesn't mean I'm scared of you, Qin Ming. For heaven's sake, when I was hanging out in the village, you were still crawling on your mother’s belly, not even knowing where cats came from!"</p><p>Qin Ming glared fiercely, making him seem formidable, but only he knew how confident he truly felt.</p><p>"You have a point; you weren't around when I was growing up. But haven’t you heard that saying?"</p><p>"What... what saying?"</p><p>"The later generation surpasses the previous one, and the new is better than the old."</p><p>After speaking, Zhu Tianlei took out two bills from a stack of cash, smiling as he clutched them in his hand. When he released them, pink powder drifted into the air with the breeze.</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei reach for the money again, Qin Ming could no longer remain calm.</p><p>"Hold it! Zhu Tianlei, if you have something to say, speak up, but don’t defile my money, okay?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei raised an eyebrow, his gaze both mocking and chilling.</p><p>"Then explain where this money came from. But..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei started speaking but suddenly paused. Just as Qin Ming was about to think of an excuse, Zhu Tianlei interrupted with "but."</p><p>"If even one word you say is a lie, then these bills will share the same fate as those two pieces of paper earlier. You should know if my words mean anything."</p><p>"What do I owe you for telling you who I am? This money is what I earned, got it?"</p><p>Having been a rascal and rogue for over ten years, Qin Ming was no pushover when it came to courage, face-saving tactics, or wits.</p><p>"Earned? How did you earn it, by spreading rumors and passing on information?"</p><p>Qin Ming could already determine that Zhu Tianlei had heard their conversation in the cave.

How did you earn it—by spreading rumors and passing on information?"</p><p>Qin Ming could already determine that Zhu Tianlei had heard their conversation in the cave. It mattered little; catching a cheating spouse required solid evidence. Without proof, Zhu Tianlei would remain unconvicted even if he refused to admit it.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, stop slandering me.

You should know if my words mean anything."</p><p>Qin Ming gulped.</p><p>"Clear, clear. Tian Lei, you are renowned in the village for your impeccable reputation and unparalleled skills in handling matters. This money......"</p><p>Qin Ming glanced at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Do not worry. As long as what you say is true, I will return every penny to you, including the two bills from earlier."</p><p>Relieved by the assurance, Qin Ming finally relaxed his stance.</p><p>"It went like this, roughly ten days ago. I was drying corn at the village entrance when a person approached me asking for directions, specifically about your home. After a brief exchange, he began inquiring about you personally."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei listened calmly, and Qin Ming could not fathom the reasoning behind his expression. He hesitated briefly before continuing.</p><p>"He asked in great detail, starting from your childhood, Tian Lei. This is not mere speculation; prior to being falsely accused of murder by Widow Chen, you were neither proficient in medicine nor adept in martial arts, correct?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei gave Qin Ming a look but did not respond.</p><p>"I told him about this incident. He was very interested and asked for directions to the gourd cave, even giving me one thousand yuan, stating that he would contact me if needed."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's mind raced as he considered the identity of this individual, narrowing it down to two possibilities.</p><p>This morning, the man appeared again, insisting on accompanying Qin Ming to visit the gourd cave. Initially reluctant, Qin Ming went along after realizing the other person...... "Tian Lei, I did nothing there, merely exchanged some words."</p><p>Afraid that Zhu Tianlei would react negatively, Qin Ming kept a close eye on his expression and the money in his hand.</p><p>"Do you know who this man is?"</p><p>"I have no idea. He didn't mention it...... Ah, I do have his phone number."</p><p>Captivated by the money, Qin Ming did not wait for further questioning from Zhu Tianlei; he blurted out everything he knew.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took the phone number Qin Ming had written for him and then pulled out two hundred-yuan bills from his pocket, putting them into an envelope.</p><p>"Qin Ming, you're not young anymore, why don't you do some legitimate business!"</p><p>After Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, he reinserted the envelope back into Qin Ming's shirt pocket and then strode out of the courtyard.</p><p>Qin Ming watched Zhu Tianlei's retreating figure, feeling rather perplexed.</p>

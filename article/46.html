						<p>Hao Xinmei did not have time to drink water and took out several pieces of paper from her backpack, her face showing a stern expression.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei received the test results and quickly scanned through them. When his gaze landed on the last line of small text, his face turned unusually grave.</p><p>"Professor Li said that these parasites cannot naturally survive outside the human body unless they have been treated with chemical agents. Compared to larvae, adult parasites are more contagious."</p><p>When Hao Xinmei heard Professor Li's explanation, she was also shocked. According to Professor Li, these parasites must have undergone artificial processing, so the presence of these parasites in Xiaohei Stream could not help but make people shudder.</p><p>"Xinmei, you've worked hard. I need to go out for a while and won't accompany you now!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei grabbed the test results from the table without saying much and rushed out of the room, heading straight for the village office.</p><p>Only Ma Lanlan and Hao Xinmei were left in the clinic. The two women looked at each other, neither knowing what to say, creating an extremely awkward atmosphere.</p><p>As for Zhu Tianlei, he arrived at the village office at lightning speed with the results in hand. Just as he was about to push open the door, he heard voices coming from inside the room.</p><p>"Village Chief Yao, this is my fourth visit. I believe you can see our Shengshi Group's sincerity. If you sign your agreement, we will give Village Chief Yao an additional 200,000 yuan as a reward."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned. Who was this person?</p><p>Sign?</p><p>What signature?</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei remained calm on the outside, his mind raced with questions.</p><p>"Assistant Li, I have already told you that the land of Hamagou Village is collectively owned by the villagers and is not solely under my Yao Gang's jurisdiction. I have also discussed this matter with other village cadres, and they do not agree. Assistant Li, it would be best if you went back!"</p><p>"Village Chief Yao, don't be stubborn and set in your ways; it's not good for anyone. Whatever Shengshi Group wants to do will get done, so Village Chief Yao, I suggest you think carefully again!"</p><p>Assistant Li's tone suddenly changed, even threatening Yao Gang.</p><p>"Hmph, Assistant Li, although I Yao Gang am just a village chief, I'm not that kind of greedy person who sees money and forgets everything. The villagers in Hama Gou have no other sources of income; eating, wearing, housing, and transportation all depend on those few acres of land. You are pushing us step by step, do you want to drive everyone to death?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was somewhat surprised. Yao Gang's temper in the village was considered quite good; he rarely got angry, at most raising his voice a little bit, but now he was clearly extremely furious.</p><p>"Alright, Village Chief Yao, since I've said all my nice things and you still won't come to your senses, don't blame us for being ruthless. Then, when it's time, don't cry and beg me to buy the land of Hama Gou!"</p><p>Footsteps were heard in the room, and Zhu Tianlei quickly moved aside to see a man in his late twenties, tall and slender with fair skin wearing rimless glasses, angrily walking past him.</p><p>"Village Chief!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei only glanced at him before entering the house.</p><p>Yao Gang's face was ugly, his chest heaving up and down clearly showing how angry he was. Seeing Zhu Tianlei come in, he managed to force a smile.</p><p>"It's Tianlei, come in quickly, do you have something to discuss with me?"</p><p>Yao Gang still valued Zhu Tianlei very much, so even though he was in a bad mood, he treated Zhu Tianlei with a pleasant expression.</p><p>"Village Chief, is our village selling land?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't plan on beating around the bush and wasn't uncomfortable letting Yao Gang know that he had just been outside.</p><p>Yao Gang was stunned, not expecting Zhu Tianlei to bring up this matter right away.</p><p>"It's not for sale; these people are persistently demanding to buy it. Since last year, they have come to the village office multiple times asking me, I've already made it clear that our village land is not for sale, yet they insist on not letting go, sigh!"</p><p>Yao Gang hesitated for a moment, feeling that there was no need to lie to Zhu Tianlei about this matter, especially since Zhu Tianlei had already heard his conversation with Assistant Li. If he lied now, it would only lead to more misunderstandings.</p><p>"What do these people want to buy our land for?"</p><p>This was something Zhu Tianlei was very curious about. Hama Gou is located deep in the mountains; although the natural environment is good, transportation is extremely inconvenient, making it unrealistic to develop any industries or economy. Why would they persistently insist on buying the land of Hama Gou?</p><p>"This I don't know either, these people...... Sigh, never mind. Tianlei, when you came to find me, it wasn't about this matter, was it?"</p><p>Seeing that Yao Gang seemed very unwilling to talk about the issue, Zhu Tianlei did not press further and casually took out the test results and handed them to Yao Gang.</p><p>"These are......"?</p><p>Yao Gang glanced at the test results in his hand, unable to understand Zhu Tianlei's meaning.</p><p>"Villager Leader, I have already figured out the reason why people in our village contracted this strange illness."</p><p>"Oh? What is the reason?"</p><p>Yao Gang had recently been driven to the brink of exhaustion by these strange illnesses and felt greatly relieved when he heard that Zhu Tianlei had found the cause, instantly becoming excited.</p><p>"The reason is on these test results. The villagers who fell ill share a common factor: they all drank water contaminated with parasites."</p><p>"Parasites? You mean there are parasites in our village's water?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded.</p><p>"Tianlei, that doesn't make sense. If what you say is true and the sick people contracted the illness from drinking contaminated water, then why is it that only one person in a household gets sick while the rest are fine? Wouldn't parasites pick their victims selectively?"</p><p>Yao Gang raised his own doubts. In fact, Zhu Tianlei had already thought of this question earlier; it was what puzzled him the most.</p><p>But just now, he suddenly had a hunch.</p><p>"Villager Leader, I have categorized and organized the information about the villagers who got sick in our village. Take a look."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took out another piece of paper from his pocket; he had carried this paper around for an entire day and night.</p><p>Yao Gang took the paper and saw that it listed basic information about all nineteen patients, including gender, age, family situation, and more.</p><p>"Tianlei, I still can't figure out how this relates to the cause of illness you mentioned. Just tell me directly!"</p><p>Yao Gang was indeed perplexed and had no idea what Zhu Tianlei was trying to convey by coming over today.</p><p>"These people are all weak old folks, children, women, and the disabled like Du Bo. They all have one thing in common: they each own land."</p><p>Yao Gang carefully considered this and realized that Zhu Tianlei was correct.</p><p>"However, Qu Chuan from the neighboring village is a strong man, yet he also got sick with the strange illness. How can you explain that?"</p><p>"It was an accident for Qu Chuan."</p><p>"Tianlei, do you mean to say that everyone in our village who got sick wasn't by chance, but rather it was deliberate?"</p><p>As expected of a village chief, one accidental case helped Yao Gang quickly grasp the underlying issue.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded.</p><p>"Tianlei, that's impossible. Even if those people were very brave, they wouldn't dare to do something like that; it involves human lives!"</p>

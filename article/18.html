						<p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei actually had the audacity to flirt and tease with her, Hao Xinmei was at a loss for words—partly amused, partly frustrated. Was this boy really a miracle doctor?</p><p>"Damn it, hit him! Hit him!"</p><p>Sun Jiang was the son of Sun Corporation, and his grandmother, Madam Sun, had always spoiled him senseless. From childhood to adulthood, he caused more trouble than there were hairs on his head, relying on his family's wealth and knowing no fear.</p><p>He had never endured such humiliation before. The woman he fancied did not give him a second glance but instead flirted with some punk. This punk clearly looked like a poor nobody who dared to snap his wrist.</p><p>He wanted this boy dead!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's mood changed drastically at Hao Xinmei's attitude. Smirking, he kicked one of the men coming at him and sent him flying out. Before the other could react, Zhu Tianlei struck again, elbowing him in the shoulder blade with a sharp thud.</p><p>The entire sequence was swift as a fleeting glance, so fast that Sun Jiang's grip on Zhu Tianlei's hand never released.</p><p>Sun Jiang could not believe his bodyguards were so easily defeated, immediately becoming furious enough to see stars.</p><p>The two bodyguards felt humiliated and indignant. They had been hired by the elderly Sun CEO at a hefty price to protect Sun Jiang, yet now they were knocked down by one move from an unremarkable rural bumpkin.</p><p>They would not tolerate such humiliation, even if Sun Jiang did not mention it.</p><p>Hao Xinmei and Ma Lanlan standing on the periphery watched in stunned silence, as did the villagers.</p><p>"I advise you two to stop, otherwise you might not have such good luck next time!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke calmly and composedly. However, this calmness made the bodyguards feel humiliated, and they disregarded everything else, lunging at Zhu Tianlei like famished tigers attacking their prey!</p><p>"Listen to advice and eat well. Since you two won't listen, don't blame me!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei muttered under his breath before suddenly exerting force. Sun Jiang was immediately lifted off the ground, looking in terror at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>What the hell is this punk up to?</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Sun Jiang, weighing over 170 pounds, was thrown out like a sandbag by Zhu Tianlei, hitting two bodyguards on his way and sending all three of them tumbling into a nearby mud pit.</p><p>"Sun Jiang, I don't care who you are, but today I, Zhu Tianlei, am telling you that Hao Xinmei is my woman. If you dare to have any thoughts about her again, be prepared for me to break both your legs!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei slowly walked to the edge of the mud pit, looking at the three entangled figures and said each word with emphasis.</p><p>Sun Jiang's eyes were filled with hatred, but he knew that he had met his match today. A real man doesn't take a beating lying down; Sun Jiang absolutely would not give up easily!</p><p>Watching Sun Jiang and the two bodyguards slink into the jeep, the villagers suddenly burst into thunderous applause.</p><p>"Tianlei, you kid, you can do it! Forget about your medical skills for now; you're also great at fighting. You really are a credit to our village!"</p><p>The chubby aunt spoke first, and as soon as the loudspeaker started broadcasting, the villagers immediately became lively.</p><p>"That's right, that's right, Old Zhu Family Brother, you're going to enjoy some good fortune this time around. That pretty girl is Tianlei's wife, right? Wow, she's really beautiful!"</p><p>Zhu Qiezi and his wife were surrounded by people, although they were all saying nice things, the smiles on their faces were forced.</p><p>Hiding and hiding still didn't work; now it was even worse. The entire village had seen his son standing up for that girl, making it even harder to find a girlfriend in the future.</p><p>Hao Xinmei held Hua Rong, her heart pounding as she looked at Zhu Tianlei standing opposite her with a smug smile.</p><p>But just now, she experienced for the first time in her life what it felt like to be cherished and protected.</p><p>"Beautiful Hao, how should I thank you?"</p><p>Looking at Xingmei Hao's icy expression, a faint blush and touch of emotion appeared. Zhu Tianlei's heart felt as if it had been scratched by a cat, causing an intense itch.</p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p>Although Xingmei Hao was grateful in her heart, seeing Zhu Tianlei's carefree and sinister face, she couldn't bring herself to say anything!</p><p>"How about offering yourself?"</p><p>Suddenly, Zhu Tianlei leaned forward, whispering into Xingmei Hao's ear. Before she could react, he gently took Hua Rong from her arms.</p><p>"You little thing, you're much gentler than your mother!"</p><p>"You......"</p><p>Xingmei Hao was so furious that her cheeks turned red. After a moment, she realized that Sun Jiang had torn her shirt collar. Fortunately, Zhu Tianlei's appearance helped her; otherwise, she wouldn't have dared to imagine what would happen today!</p><p>Thinking this way, subtle changes arose in her heart again!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, however, happily left the crowd with Hua Rong, but he felt as if a cold ray of ice was shooting at him.</p><p>"Lanlan?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned his gaze and saw Ma Lanlan standing beside the earth pile, hugging her shoulders, and pouting her lips.</p><p>Since parting ways at the village elementary school that day, this was their first meeting. However, it seemed he hadn't offended her?</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei was smart, he had never truly interacted with women, so he naturally couldn't understand their feelings. He racked his brains but couldn't figure out why this little pepper was glaring at him.</p><p>"Humph! Zhu Tianlei, you really are amazing, saving the beauty like a hero, hmm, even better than in movies!"</p><p>Was this praise?</p><p>"Isn't it?"</p><p>"Do you have a crush on me?"</p><p>For a while, Zhu Tianlei suddenly had an epiphany about Ma Lanlan's attitude.</p><p>Ma Lanlan was indeed angry, especially after hearing what Zhu Tianlei said to Sun Jiang last. It felt like a hot spoonful of oil had been poured right onto her heart.</p><p>"Who's Pan An? Am I not more handsome than him?"</p><p>"Shameless!"</p><p>Looking at Zhu Tianlei's provoking demeanor, Ma Lanlan could not vent her anger and could only spit to cool herself off.</p><p>"Hehe, good Lanlan, don't worry. No matter what happens, you are the most beautiful in my heart. How can anyone compare to you? I like big ones!"</p><p>"You.....Zhu Tianlei, I'll tear your mouth apart and stop you from spouting nonsense!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan was as fiery-tempered as ever but still a maiden who had never been married. Hearing Zhu Tianlei's words made her wish she could disappear into the ground.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei laughed heartily and dashed out like the wind.</p><p>Ma Lanlan did not dare to chase after him in public and could only tightly wring the hem of her clothes, then look thoughtfully at Hao Xinmei who was slowly following Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>What was the relationship between this woman and Zhu Tianlei?</p>

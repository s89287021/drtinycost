						<p>Zhu Tianlei's light and airy "three-person word" was spoken out, Sun Jianguo did not get angry but laughed instead.</p><p>"Well done, dog relying on human power. Today, I will let you see what real power is. Qiu Ran, instigating trouble and maliciously causing serious injury to others—do these charges meet your standards for arrest?"</p><p>A tall, thin man walked out from beside Sun Jianguo. This person's looks were decent, though his skin was overly fair, and his eyes too dark.</p><p>"More than enough, stinky brat! Daring to touch Sun Jiang, you must be looking for death!"</p><p>The man called Qiu Ran was in civilian clothes, but Zhu Tianlei could immediately tell he was a police officer. It seemed likely that this was the brother-in-law Sun Jiang had mentioned.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei really did have a knack for meeting police today!</p><p>"Arrest him and take him back to headquarters!"</p><p>With a rustle, two officers unfolded their handcuffs from their hands, clearly well-prepared.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pursed his lips. He could tell that he would not get off easily even if he did nothing to Sun Jiang. Had he known so earlier, it might have been better to break the other leg of Sun Jiang.</p><p>Thinking this, he glanced at Sun Jiang. The moment Sun Jiang's eyes met Zhu Tianlei's gaze, his body trembled instantly.</p><p>"Mr. Old Sun, you can't arrest him. All of this is because of me! I, Hao Xinmei, will take full responsibility for any consequences; it has nothing to do with him!"</p><p>Seeing Qiu Ran about to handcuff Zhu Tianlei, Hao Xinmei immediately rushed forward. Qiu Ran was the son-in-law from the Sun family, and falling into his hands meant trouble for Zhu Tianlei. Inside the station, he could easily find ways to frame Zhu Tianlei, who would be dead before he knew it.</p><p>"Xinmei, I have always admired you, but today's events disappoint me. Furthermore, you cannot shoulder this responsibility."</p><p>Hao Xinmei's face changed slightly. She was not unaware of Mr. Old Sun's intentions, but with his position and her not being an ordinary woman, the truth had never been revealed. Besides, Mr. Old Sun had guided her into the industry, so she had always respected him.</p><p>"Mr. Old Sun, I am willing to offer twenty percent of Mei Xin Pharmaceutical's shares for your leniency. Please save me this face!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei knew that Sun Jianguo had long been interested in acquiring a share of her company, trying various methods secretly or openly, but she had always avoided it. Therefore, she was not convinced that Sun Jianguo would remain unmoved.</p><p>Sun Jianguo couldn't help but take a careful look at Hao Xinmei, then glanced at Zhu Tianlei, who stood inconspicuously beside her. The anger in his eyes grew stronger.</p><p>"Qiu Ran, aren't you going to move?"</p><p>Qiu Ran's wife, Sun Xiaomei, was a child adopted from an orphanage by the Sun family. Although she did not receive much attention from Sun Jianguo and his mother, her name was listed on the family register. Qiu Ran, who came from a rural background, would never have climbed to the position of Chief Inspector without relying on the Sun family.</p><p>Therefore, despite Sun Xiaomei's explosive temper, which often humiliated him, he still held onto the tree that was the Sun family and treated Sun Jianguo's words as divine command.</p><p>"Arrest him!"</p><p>Qiu Ran ignored Hao Xinmei. In his view, others' words were mere wind in his ears; as long as he didn't offend Sun Jianguo, his career would proceed smoothly.</p><p>"Do you dare attack a police officer?"</p><p>Just as the young policeman was about to cuff Zhu Tianlei with handcuffs, Zhu Tianlei stretched out his hand and lightly touched the back of the policeman's hand. The handcuffs clattered to the ground with a jingle.</p><p>Qiu Ran was somewhat surprised. He knew this kid dared to injure Sun Jiang because he was brave, but attacking a police officer still astonished him. Ordinary fighting and assaulting an officer were two different matters; it was unclear whether the kid was reckless or just foolish.</p><p>"Old Sun, always like this, I'll say it again: your son uses his power to bully people, repeatedly tormenting Xiao Mei. I crippled one of his arms and legs out of mercy. If he dares to attack Hao Xinmei again, what I take away won't be parts of him but his life!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei finished speaking and grabbed Hao Xinmei's hand.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei looked at Zhu Tianlei's handsome profile; for a moment, she really wanted to leave with him without rational thought. Such a man, she did not want to miss, but she was Hao Xinmei, not some naive teenager willing to give up everything for love.</p><p>"Tianlei......"</p><p>"Mr. Sun, Young Master's leg is fractured severely and must be operated on urgently; otherwise, the leg might be lost!"</p><p>At this moment, a voice rang out. Sun Jianguo immediately turned his head, and Zhu Tianlei followed his gaze.</p><p>"Oh, what a coincidence! ZHU Tianlei looked at the person squatting beside Sun Jiang and his eyes darkened slightly. This person was none other than Zhao Zhiguo, who had lost a bet to him.</p><p>'What, Doctor Zhao is still wearing his lab coat?'</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo raised his head in the direction of the voice and immediately saw Zhu Tianlei standing in the crowd. His face instantly turned extremely ugly.</p><p>He never thought that today he would encounter the person who had made him suffer so much again, right in front of Sun Corporation's president.</p><p>"President Sun, was it this guy who injured Young Master Sun?"</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo seemed to have suddenly understood something as he looked at Sun Jianguo and asked.</p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p>Sun Jianguo did not answer, but that single hmph gave Zhao Zhiguo the answer.</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo's heart leaped with joy at this moment. This brat really didn't know his place; he dared to attack Sun Jiang. It seemed he wouldn't need to take action himself, as this brat was digging his own grave and hurrying towards his death.</p><p>"President Sun, apart from the compound fracture of Young Master Sun's leg, his ligaments were also severely damaged, and the surrounding soft tissues sustained serious injuries. The person who attacked clearly intended to kill Young Master Sun!"</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo slowly spoke, putting on a look of deep sorrow.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei raised an eyebrow; he was now certain that he definitely did not know Zhao Zhiguo, but the other party was truly relentless in dealing with him. It seemed his earlier guess had been correct; the other party envied his medical skills and hated him even more after being defeated by his hands.</p><p>"Qiu Ran, call Director Zhang!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei's heart shook. Director Zhang was the second-in-command of Yinhai City Police Bureau. Although he was in a secondary position, he was a true power player. He had once been Sun Jianguo's student and had a very close relationship.</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo's expression remained unchanged, but he silently cheered. He was eager to see what this young man could do to flip out of the palm of Buddha Sakyamuni.</p><p>"Ximei, how do I use this phone?"</p><p>Suddenly, Zhu Tianlei turned around and asked the person next to him, Hao Xinmei. Hao Xinmei was taken aback and didn't understand why Zhu Tianlei would ask her such a question at a time when tensions were high and every second counted.</p><p>The others also looked at Zhu Tianlei in surprise, thinking that he must have been frightened out of his mind; with Party Secretary Zhang arriving, it was as if even wings couldn't help him escape.</p><p>"Or maybe you could call for me."</p>

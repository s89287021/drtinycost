						<p>Máo Fāng gripped the hem of her dress nervously, her palms slick with sweat. Despite this, she could not ease her tension. After coming to his senses, Wei Bǎoguó also stared intently at Zhu Tiānléi’s every move, trying to figure out what Zhu Tiānléi would do and why he dared to say such audacious words. Zhu Tiānléi’s palms were also drenched in sweat, but no one could tell. The acupuncture techniques of Ling Yī Xiānshù had a very special characteristic: as the spirit energy within the body filled up, the acupuncture techniques would become more flexible. Now, Zhu Tiānléi was already able to administer needles while simultaneously guiding spirit energy into the patient’s body along with the silver needles. However, this was not the most miraculous aspect; the most miraculous part was that the spirit energy now possessed a probing function. For example, in what seemed like fluid and seamless movements, Zhu Tiānléi’s spirit energy was actually assessing the patient’s condition and the position of the silver needles. If the position was correct, the spirit energy would flow smoothly; if it was off, the spirit energy would weaken significantly. Ten minutes later, Zhu Tiānléi stopped. "How is it?" Mao Fāng asked, as if she had exhausted all her strength. "Come over and check for yourself!" Zhu Tiānléi’s tone was very calm, but a flash of relief quickly passed through his eyes. Mao Fāng felt uneasy, wanting to sprint over but afraid of seeing what she did not want to see, hesitating to take a step forward. "Āfáng..." "Old Jiao!" Wei Bǎoguó was stunned as if struck by lightning.</p><p>How is this possible?</p><p>Máo Fāng collapsed beside the patient's bed, sobbing uncontrollably.</p><p>Zhū Tiānlěi stood up and glanced at the tearful Mao Fang with a faint expression before turning around and heading towards the door.</p><p>"Dean Wei, the patient's body is very weak. This is a proprietary formula I made for them. Remember to give it to the patient three times a day."</p><p>After saying that, Zhū Tiānlěi handed several 'Qīnglù Táiwán' pills he was carrying to Wèi Bǎoguó and then left in big strides without looking back.</p><p>For him, his debt of gratitude to Li Ping had been repaid. There was no point staying any longer.</p><p>Although he still couldn't be 100% sure about the patient's condition, he could guarantee the effectiveness of his Lingyi Seventeen Needles and Huizhuàn Pills.</p><p>The news of the sterile ward quickly spread. Li Ping was so happy that he accompanied Zhū Tiānlěi all the way to the parking lot, even pulling on Zhū Tiānlěi's hand and praising him with phrases like "incredible" and "great."</p><p>As soon as Li Ping returned to his department, news had already spread throughout the entire city hospital that the patient could sit up.</p><p>In the pharmacy section, Bái Sōng frowned and scolded a junior staff member who had just entered to inquire about the price of medication.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>These were the three words Bai Song had asked most frequently in his short few hours today.</p><p>Máo Fang looked at her lover with a beaming smile. In just a few hours, Lǎo Qiáo had been transferred from the sterile ward to a regular ward and even drank two sips of water, which made Mao Fang ecstatic.</p><p>However, when Lǎo Qiáo asked who treated him, Mao Fang could only stammer in response. She now regretted her attitude towards Zhū Tiānlěi, but he was already gone, and it was too late to feel sorry.</p><p>After leaving the hospital, Zhū Tiānlěi checked the time and found that it was just past noon. He then searched for a map on Baidu, drove into Yúnhǎi City's largest traditional Chinese medicine trading center—Yúnhǎi Shēnróng Market.</p><p>Although it was called the Shēnróng Market, the types of Chinese medicines being bought and sold were far more extensive than just ginseng and deer antlers. In fact, ginseng and deer antlers only accounted for a small portion, with most items being finished products or semi-processed medicines.</p><p>The market covers an area of 300,000 square meters and is divided into six zones (a-f) based on the types and methods of traditional Chinese medicine transactions. Each zone has five buildings, with each building having six floors.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei emerged from the underground parking garage, looking at the densely packed layout map, feeling a bit dazed. He had previously learned some information about the ginseng and deer antler market online, but understanding was one thing, and experiencing it firsthand was another.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei carefully examined the layout map, selecting two zones that piqued his interest, deepening the impression of the zone map in his mind, and then strode confidently towards the staircase. As soon as he stepped out of the elevator, Zhu Tianlei was hit by a strong, slightly pungent smell of traditional Chinese medicine, causing his throat to tighten.</p><p>He frowned slightly. His understanding and familiarity with traditional Chinese medicine far exceeded that of anyone who visited the ginseng and deer antler market, thanks to the influence of Ling Yi Xian Shu (a mythical medical technique). Even if he had not personally come into contact with certain herbs, he could identify them just by looking at and smelling them.</p><p>However, the smell of the herbs he was currently experiencing seemed a bit off. Zhu Tianlei came here considering that as the production scale of Tianlei Pharmaceutical continued to expand, it was likely that the traditional Chinese medicine supply from Xiaohexi Herb Field would not be sufficient. Therefore, he had to take preemptive measures.</p><p>However, after wandering around in the market for quite some time, he noticed that the quality of the herbs did not meet his expectations at all. To make good medicine, one must first ensure the quality of the raw materials, a point Zhu Tianlei was very strict about; he would rather halt production than lower the quality of his medications.</p><p>Could it be that even in such a large traditional Chinese medicine market, there were no herbs meeting his standards?</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei felt somewhat disappointed and was about to leave, an argument caught his ear.</p><p>"You give my herbs back..."</p><p>"Pah, old man, do you not fear lightning striking your tongue broad daylight? I did not take anything of yours. What evidence do you have?"</p><p>"You... You said you were going to take them to check the year, then you never brought them back! Give them back! I won't sell anymore!"</p><p>"Old man, don't you see where this place is? I've been working at Great Medicine for over a decade; who doesn't know that I, Ye Xiumei, am an honest person? Hurry up and leave; don't delay my business..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned his head and saw an old man in his sixties standing outside the door of a pharmacy next to the elevator. He was lean, hunched over with a pronounced stoop, and he was arguing with someone inside.</p><p>Through the glass wall, there was a burly woman with a rugged appearance. She had her hair tied up in a ponytail, pinched her waist, and when she spoke, her ponytail swung back and forth with the movements of the two lumps on her belly.</p><p>For some reason, the old man's appearance instantly reminded Zhu Tianlei of his own father, Zhu Qiezi. Subconsciously, he moved towards the Great Medicine pharmacy.</p><p>"You're bullying me, you're bullying an old man like me...you...you..."</p><p>The old man was very angry; it seemed like he wanted to curse them, but after stuttering for a while, he couldn't manage to say anything and his body shook with anger.</p><p>"Bullying me? Do I have the time for that? Get lost, get lost, get lost. Have you considered how much compensation you owe me for delaying my business?"</p><p>The burly woman was very smug, shooing the old man away as if he were a fly.</p><p>"Sir, what's going on here?"</p><p>Before Zhu Tianlei could reach the pharmacy door, the old man pulled his head and walked over with blurred eyes.</p>

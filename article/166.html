						<p>After graduating from university, everyone went their separate ways. Although most people stayed in Yunhai City to develop, there were also those like Qiao Kang who left Yunhai City and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>However, what he never expected was that the Qiao Kang he knew back in school, who was always buried in his books and would blush even when speaking, would enter politics and become an existence they could never reach.</p><p>"Because from the day I entered the government compound, I told myself, I, Qiao Kang, would be a good official, one who does not seek private gain or favoritism, truly serving the people and the country. But I also knew that in life, the hardest thing is social etiquette; how many upright-hearted people ultimately destroyed themselves over these two words. That's why I left Yunhai and everything I was familiar with."</p><p>Qiao Kang spoke slowly. Zhu Tianlei, who had already raised his foot to leave, stopped again when he heard this.</p><p>"These years, I have been down-to-earth, striving towards my goal in heart, though I haven't achieved any glorious political accomplishments, I have never felt remorseful, I've never taken a penny that wasn't mine, and I've never done anything against my conscience. So, Sun JianGuo, take this card back; let's pretend we've never seen each other in the past twenty years."</p><p>Standing beside the bed, Sun JianGuo's face turned extremely ugly.</p><p>"Leave!"</p><p>Sun JianGuo was about to say more when Qiao Kang closed his eyes, a clear sign for him to leave.</p><p>When Sun JianGuo arrived, he was full of confidence, thinking that he was finally going to make it. Although he was in business, he had mingled in official circles and considered himself well-versed in everything there.</p><p>Twenty million, even for someone of Qiao Kang's status, was no small amount, and what Sun JianGuo was asking for was simple: just one word from Qiao Kang.</p><p>But Qiao Kang refused, and his refusal was decisive!</p><p>Though twenty years had passed, Sun JianGuo still understood that Qiao Kang's refusal was genuine; it wasn't a strategy to retreat but a dead end to all possibilities.</p><p>"Take the card!"</p><p>Just as Sun JianGuo was about to leave, Qiao Kang, who had closed his eyes, spoke again. Sun JianGuo, holding the card, felt like he was walking on cotton.</p><p>"What are you doing here?"</p><p>Dazed and confused, Sun JianGuo pushed open the door. Just as he stepped out, he saw Zhu Tianlei standing with his arms crossed at the doorway, a fire blazing in his eyes.</p><p>"Excuse me, I am the attending physician of this ward. May I ask what brings Chairman Sun to us?"</p><p>"Are you a doctor at the City Hospital?"</p><p>Chairman Sun asked in shock.</p><p>This is impossible. When Zhao Zhiguo was transferred to the inspection department, he had investigated and found out that although Zhu Tianlei had an employment contract with the County Hospital, he lacked a medical practice certificate. Moreover, the City Hospital was far more stringent than the County Hospital; how could Zhu Tianlei be here? Most importantly, he is the attending physician of Qiao Kang.</p><p>"To be precise, I was specially invited by Mrs. Qiao."</p><p>Chairman Sun's body involuntarily swayed.</p><p>Had Qiao Kang refused him because of this Zhu Tianlei?</p><p>"Is it Tianlei?"</p><p>Qiao Kang's voice echoed from within the room.</p><p>"Mr. Chairman, excuse me, we will meet another time!"</p><p>With that, Zhu Tianlei smiled at Chairman Sun and then brushed past him to enter the ward.</p><p>"Haha, Tianlei, your medical skills are truly remarkable! I had a large bowl of congee this morning!"</p><p>"Uncle Qiao, I guarantee you can have two bowls tonight!"</p><p>"Really? Then I look forward to seeing that happen!"</p><p>...</p><p>Listening to the conversation in the room, Chairman Sun's fists clenched tightly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, Zhu Tianlei, he is bound to make Zhu Tianlei wish he were dead one day.</p><p>Watching Sun Jianguo stumble away, Zhu Tianlei sneered inwardly.</p><p>This Sun Jianguo is truly a mudskipper in the river and sand in the sea, getting into every corner. There was no need to guess which two pharmaceutical companies he mentioned.</p><p>"Hey Tianlei, did you hear what I just said?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei heard the conversation between Sun Jianguo and Qiao Jang at the door. He had always been an open and honest person, so he didn't try to avoid it.</p><p>"Yeah, I heard."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was also honest. Moreover, Qiao Jang's words made his blood boil. Qiao Jang's mind was as clear as the sky, exceptionally bright, far surpassing any officials he had met before.</p><p>"Then aren't you curious about my identity?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Qiao Jang and didn't expect him to ask such a question. However, someone who could make Sun Jianguo beg so persistently, whose wife could casually assign tasks to the city's public security system, must have quite an impressive background.</p><p>"I am curious, but only out of curiosity. I don't have as many ideas as Chairman Sun. I live and work in peace without needing to curry favor with or rely on anyone. That's all my curiosity amounts to."</p><p>Qiao Jang looked at Zhu Tianlei and admired this young man.</p><p>"I am the Provincial Secretary of Yunhai."</p><p>Qiao Jang said each word deliberately.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was startled. This identity was truly high!</p><p>Yunhai Province is different from other provinces in China. Although Yunhaicity is Yunhai's most important economic, political, and cultural center, it is not the provincial capital.</p><p>The provincial capital is located in the northwest of Yunhai Province, within a strategic deployment area, the newly developed city of Dawu Lake.</p><p>And the person who organized the construction of this city was none other than Qiao Kuang, then Secretary of Dawu Lake City, fifteen years ago. What was once a desolate wilderness covered in yellow earth had been transformed beyond recognition within ten years.</p><p>Under the attraction of various policies, countless talents flooded into Dawu Lake City. Today, Dawu Lake is gradually gaining momentum to replace Yinhai City in terms of political and economic status.</p><p>"I never thought that I, Zhu Tianlei, would have the chance to meet the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee.</p><p>"Haha, kid, you truly surprised me. So, how about it, saving the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, don't you want any form of compensation?"</p><p>Qiao Kuang liked Zhu Tianlei and couldn't resist making a teasing remark.</p><p>"To be honest, Secretary Qiao, your words earlier got my blood boiling. The greatest reward I could wish for is for you to remain a dedicated official who serves the people and the country!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke sincerely, and Qiao Kuang's expression turned serious as well.</p><p>"Good child, for that statement alone, Uncle Qiao will definitely make sure to be a good official!"</p><p>The two individuals in the ward exchanged glances and smiled at each other.</p><p>"Oh, Tianlei, there's something I've wanted to ask you."</p><p>"What is it, Uncle Qiao?"</p><p>Qiao Kuang straightened up, his expression somewhat solemn.</p><p>"Is my illness contagious?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback. Why would Qiao Kuang ask such a question?</p><p>"Uncle Qiao, to be frank, although I cured your illness, I am still uncertain about the exact cause of your condition. Why do you ask this?"</p><p>"Because before coming to Yinhai City for an inspection, I went to a village in Qingliu County for research. To avoid disturbing local officials, I went alone. At that time, someone in the village fell ill with symptoms almost identical to mine. My illness was sudden, and I never had the chance to confirm this, but I can't help but doubt."</p>

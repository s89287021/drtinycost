						<p>Kong Shengbin is a very refined person, yet he also exudes great presence. Standing on the bench of observers, no one could ignore his imposing aura; even Tang Wen could not help but be astonished.</p><p>"Meanwhile, I was also a test subject for the development of the medication to treat Deng Luolin virus infection.

Do you know that giving false testimony carries legal consequences?"</p><p>Tang Wen was already gasping for breath, but he would not give up until the very end.</p><p>If given a chance, he could have time to make arrangements and turn the situation around.</p><p>"Benefit? Vice Dean Tang, you must take responsibility for what you just said!"</p><p>Saying that, Kong Shengbin suddenly pulled out a small green notebook from his pocket.</p><p>"Attorney Lei, please hand this over to the judge. Let him see if Kong Shengbin is someone who takes benefits!"</p><p>Lei Pan was already stunned by what he had seen so far, and now, seeing the item Kong Shengbin handed over, he was even more shocked. He passed the small green notebook to the judge.</p><p>"You......You......I'm sorry, we.....we......”</p><p>Opening the small green notebook in his hand, the judge abruptly stood up, his face turning ashen.</p><p>The other jurors, glancing at the contents of the green notebook, were also horrified, their faces drained of color.</p><p>They really were courting death!</p><p>Tang Wen, standing on the defendant’s bench, felt as though he had fallen into an ice cave.</p><p>The judge's attitude indicated that Kong Shengbin was no ordinary person.

They were in the courtroom of the city court, and even if Yang Wenjie personally appeared, the judge would not have acted this way.</p><p>Kong Shengbin is a man of great refinement, yet he also possesses an imposing presence. Standing among the spectators, his aura was so commanding that no one could overlook it—not even Tang Wen, who found himself astonished despite himself.</p><p>"Simultaneously, I served as a test subject for the development of the medication designed to combat Deng Luolin virus infection. I personally witnessed every phase of its creation and experienced firsthand the efficacy of each refinement. The individual responsible for this groundbreaking work is Zhu Tianlei, the head of the isolation zone!"</p><p>Kong Shengbin’s eyes brimmed with admiration for Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"How much did you receive from Zhu Tianlei? Do you realize that giving false testimony entails serious legal consequences?"</p><p>Tang Wen was already gasping for breath, but he refused to surrender until the very end. Given an opportunity, he could devise a strategy and potentially reverse the situation.</p><p>"Benefit? Vice Dean Tang, you must take responsibility for your words!"</p><p>With that, Kong Shengbin pulled out a small green notebook from his pocket.</p><p>"Attorney Lei, please present this to the judge so he can determine if I, Kong Shengbin, am someone who accepts benefits!"</p><p>Lei Pan was already in a state of shock from witnessing the unfolding events and was even more stunned by what Kong Shengbin had produced. He handed over the small green notebook to the judge.</p><p>"You......You......I'm sorry, we.....we......”</p><p>The judge’s face turned ashen as he opened the small green notebook in his hand and stood up abruptly.</p><p>The other jurors, glancing at its contents, were similarly horrified, their faces drained of color.</p><p>They truly were courting death!</p><p>Tang Wen, standing on the defendant’s bench, felt as though he had fallen into an ice cave.</p><p>The judge's reaction indicated that Kong Shengbin was far from ordinary. They were in the courtroom of the city court, and even if Yang Wenjie himself appeared, the judge would not have reacted this way.</p><p>"Your Honor, is there anything unclear about this case?"</p><p>Kong Shengbin asked in a matter-of-fact manner, but the judge on the bench was sweating profusely.</p><p>"No, no, it's very clear. I will now announce the verdict of the trial."</p><p>The judge replied hurriedly.</p><p>"The court hereby announces that Zhu Tianlei's lawsuit against Tang Wen for pharmaceutical infringement has been investigated and tried by this court. We have determined that the plaintiff wins. The judgment will be delivered in seven days. The session is adjourned!"</p><p>Because of Kong Shengbin's presence, the entire trial procedure was completely abbreviated; trial debates, final statements by the parties involved, in-court mediation, and deliberation by the panel were all skipped.</p><p>Tang Wen collapsed into his chair with a thud. He knew what awaited him.</p><p>Wu Xiaozhong was stunned. What did this mean? The trial had ended, so did that mean his daughter died for nothing? Would his compensation be wasted?</p><p>"Huhuhu, Your Honor, my daughter can't die in vain! You can't just ignore this! I... "</p><p>Seeing Wu Xiaozhong's tantrum, the judge gave a glance, and immediately a bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stepped down from the plaintiff's bench and stood before Tang Wen.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not harbor deep resentment towards Tang Wen; he did not wish to destroy him completely. This action was merely to ensure the safety and peace of mind of his loved ones and for the sake of justice.</p><p>After all, the development of the drug was not just Zhu Tianlei's achievement; it contained the hard work of countless people.</p><p>By the time Zhu Tianlei got up and left the courtroom, the audience had yet to react.</p><p>Hao Xinmei and Mao Yu looked at each other and simultaneously clenched their fists.</p><p>This Zhu Tianlei always acts alone and follows his own path.</p><p>"Uncle Kong, thank you so much today. If not for you, I might have ended up in jail!"</p><p>After leaving the courtroom, Zhu Tianlei smiled at Kong Shengbin.</p><p>"Little Zhu, you are too modest. With your capabilities, not only this matter but even something ten times bigger could be handled by you with ease!"</p><p>Kong Shengbin winked playfully like a child after saying that.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not inquire about Kong Shengbin's identity.</p><p>He was never someone who enjoyed prying into such matters. He admired Kong Shengbin as a person, regardless of his status.</p><p>However, Lei Pan, who watched Zhu Tianlei and Kong Shengbin chatting merrily, could not hide the depth in his eyes.</p><p>"Mr. Hao, what is Zhu Tianlei's background?"</p><p>Lei Pan frequently communicated with Hao Xinmei privately, so he did not hesitate to ask her this question.</p><p>Hao Xinmei shook her head.</p><p>What kind of background? Even she was puzzled.</p><p>This Zhu Tianlei was truly a master at playing the underdog and acting like a tiger! Number One in the world!</p><p>Not long after the trial ended, Tang Wen was taken away by the prosecution.</p><p>...</p><p>Wei Baoguo sat opposite Zhu Tianlei with a solemn expression.</p><p>"President Wei, thank you this time!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Wei Baoguo and said with a faint smile.</p><p>Strangely enough, it was due to Wei Baoguo's efforts that he managed to obtain the signed testimonies of the medical staff from the city hospital without alerting Tang Wen. Wei Baoguo had played an invaluable role in this regard.</p><p>Moreover, it was Wei Baoguo who had proactively suggested it.</p><p>"Hmph, I'm not doing this for you!"</p><p>Tang Wen's fate made Wei Baoguo feel that a thorn in his heart had finally been removed to some extent. Although he did not like Zhu Tianlei, there was no fundamental conflict of interest between them.</p><p>It was different with Tang Wen. During his tenure as acting president, Tang Wen had secretly fabricated accusations against him and transferred away or demoted many of the hospital's backbone staff that he himself had cultivated. It was clear that Tang Wen wanted to take his place.</p><p>Wei Baoguo's position was not something anyone could easily take over. Weighing the two options, Wei Baoguo naturally understood this principle.</p><p>"That is President Wei's own business. My gratitude has been conveyed. Goodbye!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood up; he truly did not like this person, Wei Baoguo.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, here's something for you!"</p><p>Seeing Wei Baoguo take out a file folder from his backpack and hand it to him, Zhu Tianlei frowned.</p><p>It reminded him of the fox paying respects to the chicken! That was his first thought.</p><p>But when he saw what was inside the folder, he could not help but be taken aback.</p><p>"I, Wei Baoguo, do not want the city hospital to lose its talent. Don't think this is something I willingly did, hmpf!"</p><p>What a stubborn person!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the 'Employment Certificate from City People's Hospital' in his hand, thinking secretly to himself.</p><p>Shortly after, Zhu Tianlei saw another person.</p><p>Jiang Haitao was dressed in a suit, with a snow-white shirt underneath. His beard was neatly shaved, and he looked energetic and vibrant, a complete contrast to the man shouting about suicide on the rooftop of the isolation zone.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, I'm leaving Yunhai City!"</p><p>This was Jiang Haitao's first sentence.</p><p>"I want to reclaim all the wasted time of these years; I want to live again. Doctor Zhu, I hope when we meet again, you can be proud of me!"</p><p>This was Jiang Haitao's second sentence.</p>

						<p>"The sixteen upright hairs and nine drooping hairs, with one of the drooping hairs having a tumor the size of a fingernail......"</p><p>Old Man Yan's voice boomed like a temple bell, and Yue Xiumei's face immediately turned ugly.</p><p>"Sir, are you sure?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled faintly and asked without glancing at Yue Xiumei's expression.</p><p>"Certain, one hundred percent certain. Because after I brought this thing home, I cleaned it myself. The medicinal value of Polygonatum hairs is also very high, and a complete Polygonatum is more valuable, so I was particularly careful and meticulous when cleaning it; there's no mistake."</p><p>When Old Man Yan said these words, he seemed like a different person, radiating confidence.</p><p>"Sis, what do you say?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned his head to look at Yue Xiumei.</p><p>"This......this......I don't......there are fifteen upright hairs......"</p><p>Yue Xiumei originally wanted to say that she didn't know, but given the situation, admitting not knowing would mean admitting defeat. Moreover, she didn't believe that Old Man Yan would have so much free time to count all the Polygonatum hairs.</p><p>"Alright, now that Sir and Sis have both given their answers, for fairness, let's find a witness, shall we? Does anyone here want to come forward as a witness?"</p><p>The onlookers became eager at Zhu Tianlei's words but thought better of it upon considering Yue Xiumei's stubbornness. No one dared to step forward; they just looked at each other.</p><p>"I will!"</p><p>A rugged voice rang out, and everyone hurriedly turned their attention upwards.</p><p>This person was none other than Feng Qi, the floor manager of the ginseng and deer antler market, thirty-six years old, known for his honesty and integrity. His full beard gave him a natural sense of authority even when he didn't speak.</p><p>"Old Feng, to tell you the truth, Old Feng being the witness is just right!"</p><p>Feng Qi stepped forward, and the onlookers nodded in approval. Zhu Tianlei only glanced at this person briefly but also nodded to himself.</p><p>The face reflects the heart; sometimes a person's temperament can be discerned from their appearance and demeanor.</p><p>Yue Xiumei did not object, in fact, even if she wanted to object, she wouldn't have been able to express it. If she were to speak out against it now, her saliva could drown her.</p><p>"Alright, how should we address this brother?"</p><p>"Feng Qi."</p><p>Feng Qi was a taciturn person who rarely spoke and had a hoarse voice, but oddly enough, this made Zhu Tianlei feel more favorably toward him.</p><p>"Brother Feng, you are aware of the whole situation. Now, please count the vertical hairs on the back of this Ho Shou Wu for us."</p><p>Feng Qi did not hesitate and carefully picked up the Ho Shou Wu from behind the counter.</p><p>Although he was not in the business of selling herbs, his daily exposure to them meant that he had a good understanding of basic herbal knowledge, which could be seen from how he turned over the Ho Shou Wu.</p><p>Feng Qi understood fairness and placed the Ho Shou Wu where everyone could see it clearly.</p><p>"1, 2, 3, 4......10, 11, 12......"</p><p>Feng Qi counted each hair, and by the time he reached the twelfth hair, some people started to join in with their counting. By the fourteenth hair, everyone was counting together.</p><p>"15."</p><p>Feng Qi stopped counting and did not continue.</p><p>The expressions of the crowd varied.</p><p>"Young brother, didn't I get it right? This thing belongs to Elder Sister without a doubt!"</p><p>Ye Xiume's heart sank, and her face lit up like a bloom. She looked at Zhu Tianlei without concealing her satisfaction.</p><p>"Counting from below, there is another 3-4 centimeter long whisker beside the fourth whisker."</p><p>The old man spoke firmly, and Feng Qi quickly lowered his head to examine carefully. Indeed, he discovered the sixteenth vertical whisker that the old man mentioned.</p><p>"Sixteen."</p><p>Feng Qi spoke again, continuing the count.</p><p>Ye Xiume was immediately taken aback. She looked at the old man, who stood with his hands behind his back; his hunched posture seemed to straighten somewhat as he glanced at Ye Xiume indifferently.</p><p>"Hmph, I didn't look closely. Running a business every day, greeting customers, how could I have the time to count it!"</p><p>Ye Xiume put on an air of disdain, but anyone with sharp eyes could see that she was feeling guilty.</p><p>"On the gambling floor, there are no fathers or sons, nor is there any concept of personal relationships. Regardless of whether Miss Big Sister is usually busy, the one who got the answer right this time is Lord. Feng Brother, announce the result!"</p><p>"This round, the old man wins!"</p><p>As soon as Feng Qi's voice fell, a chorus of applause filled the air, and Ye Xiume's face turned awkwardly resentful.</p><p>"The second question: How many lumps are there at the lower end of this Chinese yam?"</p><p>Another counting problem, but not nearly as tricky as the first. The number of lumps on a Chinese yam is one of the standards for assessing its quality. Since it was an incoming Chinese yam, it must have been inspected.</p><p>So this was a free point.</p><p>"Nine."</p><p>This time, Ye Xiume answered first.</p><p>She had been in the herbal business for fifteen years and was quite familiar with Ho Shou Wu. The usual number of chunks for this year's Ho Shou Wu was nine to ten, and she had secretly counted them, anticipating that Zhu Tianlei would ask about it.</p><p>This time, she was determined to succeed.</p><p>The pink hundred-dollar bill would belong to her, Ye Xiumei!</p><p>"Ten."</p><p>The old man spoke calmly and firmly.</p><p>Feng Qi did not wait for Zhu Tianlei to speak and started counting. Everyone held their breath, waiting for the result.</p><p>"Nine."</p><p>To be cautious, Feng Qi counted three times, but the result was consistently nine. Facing this outcome, Feng Qi seemed slightly remorseful.</p><p>"Young brother, I already told you that it's ten, but you didn't believe me. See now? This old man is just a fraudster, hehe, can I take the money now?"</p><p>Ye Xiumei had fully put her heart at ease and reached out to grab the money on the counter.</p><p>"Ten."</p><p>The old man solemnly repeated his statement.</p><p>"Old man, I know you don't want to admit defeat, but I counted three times, and it is indeed nine."</p><p>The old man was a mountain doctor who often sold herbs he had collected. Due to their high quality and reasonable prices, everyone was willing to buy from him.</p><p>Feng Qi and the old man frequently smoked together when they had nothing else to do, so their relationship was quite good. That's why Feng Qi felt compelled to explain when he heard the old man insist on his opinion.</p><p>"Ten, I swear it with my head."</p><p>Seeing Old Man Yan's stubborn insistence, Feng Qi felt a headache. Although the group was not very clear about the background of this Gastrodia elata matter, they were all willing to believe Old Man Yan. However, the current situation was undeniable, and Feng Qi could not fake it in front of everyone!</p><p>"Old Man Yan, you......"</p><p>Feng Qi was about to speak again when he saw Old Man Yan rush over.</p><p>"This is number ten."</p><p>Old Man Yan pointed at the position between the two thick tubers below the Gastrodia elata and said solemnly.</p><p>Feng Qi and the others hurriedly looked over.</p>

						<p>Zhu Tianlei sorted out the ingredient list, efficacy, dosage, and other information before handing them over to Mao Yu. Mao Yu was very satisfied and immediately went to find a design company to work on packaging, VI, and more.</p><p>Everything seemed to be moving in a positive direction. Although it was hard work, Zhu Tianlei felt an unprecedented sense of fulfillment and satisfaction.</p><p>In addition to the medication for treating dysmenorrhea, Zhu Tianlei had also developed several drugs for gastritis, headaches, and promoting blood circulation. The dysmenorrhea drug was the main focus, but these other medications were needed as auxiliary drugs to enrich their product line.</p><p>That midday, after completing the formula chart of the last medication, Zhu Tianlei finally breathed a sigh of relief, stood up, and decided to stretch his limbs behind the house.</p><p>Thinking about how he hadn't heard from Hao Xinmei since their last phone call, deep nostalgia surfaced in Zhu Tianlei's heart. He couldn't help but take out his phone, not using the contact list or call history, but instead dialing Hao Xinmei’s number digit by digit, which he knew by heart.</p><p>"Hello, Beauty Heart Pharmaceutical Corporation President's Office."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned slightly; this was Hao Xinmei’s private number. Why would someone else answer?</p><p>"Are you Xiao Chen?"</p><p>"I am Secretary Chen. The president is in a meeting. You can call again in two hours."</p><p>Xiao Chen spoke into the phone while nervously glancing at the people inside the president's office, who looked aggressive.</p><p>"What are you doing? If there’s an issue, you should report it to the relevant department. I, Hao Xinmei, will definitely not shirk responsibility, but your current behavior is illegal. Please leave!"</p><p>"Leave? My brother is our family’s pillar. He died, and our whole family can't survive without him. You have driven us to our deaths, so we won’t let you off either! Rascal, break it!"</p><p>A crash!</p><p>Through the phone, Zhu Tianlei heard the loud sound of glass shattering. Xiao Chen screamed in fright, even forgetting about Zhu Tianlei on the other end.</p><p>"Hello, hello, Xiao Chen...... Hellohello......"</p><p>The call was filled with noise.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's heart was in complete disarray. Hao Xinmei must have encountered some trouble. Without giving it a second thought, Zhu Tianlei rushed out of the courtyard.</p><p>Outside the main gate, there was a black jeep. Although it was used, the car looked to be in excellent condition.</p><p>This car was newly purchased by Zhu Tianlei, and the idea came from Mao Yu. Whether it was a natural talent or not, after only two practices, Zhu Tianlei's driving skills matched those of the experienced driver Mao Yu. Therefore, even without a license, Zhu Tianlei often drove around the village.</p><p>Now, his heart was racing with urgency, and he did not care about traffic regulations anymore. He jumped into the car, started the engine, and sped towards Yunhai City like lightning.</p><p>The jeep arrived outside Meixin Pharmaceuticals' entrance after more than half an hour. Zhu Tianlei got out of the car and ran into the building.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's reputation at Meixin Pharmaceuticals was no less than Hao Xinmei's, and in some cases, even exceeded hers. He was basically everyone's nightmare, especially all the security guards'.</p><p>Of course, Zhu Tianlei had no time to deal with these matters. He quickly passed through the lobby and rushed towards the elevator entrance.</p><p>For unknown reasons, all three elevators were stuck on the 20th floor. No matter whether he pressed up or down, the elevators remained motionless as a rock.</p><p>The more this happened, the more anxious Zhu Tianlei became. He decided to take the stairs beside them, took a deep breath, and started climbing towards the 36th floor with his feet moving like the wind without stopping once.</p><p>Meixin Pharmaceuticals' building was used for commercial purposes and had higher ceilings than residential buildings. The height of the 36th floor was roughly equivalent to the 42nd or 43rd floor of a typical apartment building.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Zhu Tianlei's figure appeared outside Hao Xinmei's office door.</p><p>Xiao Chen was kneeling on the ground, sobbing uncontrollably. The spacious office was in disarray.</p><p>"Xiao Chen, where is Mr. Hao?"</p><p>Not seeing Hao Xinmei, Zhu Tianlei's heart quickly rose to his throat. He did not care about anything else and pulled Xiao Chen up from the ground.</p><p>Xiao Chen's makeup had been smeared due to her tears. Eyeshadow, eyeliner, lip gloss, foundation, and blush mixed with tears on her face, making her look extremely disheveled.</p><p>"Is it you?"</p><p>Xiao Chen had met Zhu Tianlei before and knew of the relationship between Zhu Tianlei and Mr. Hao, so the moment she saw Zhu Tianlei, all her shock and resentment burst out like a flood released from a dam.</p><p>"Waa... those people smashed up the office..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned.</p><p>"Where's your boss, Mr. Hao?"</p><p>He didn't care about the office; he only cared about his woman.</p><p>"Mr. Hao... Mr. Hao is still in the office... hasn't come out..."</p><p>Xiao Chen finished speaking, and Zhu Tianlei immediately let go of her hand and rushed into the office.</p><p>The once elegant and spacious office, which had been mocked by Zhu Tianlei for being empty, was now in shambles.</p><p>The giant marine ecosystem aquarium was shattered into pieces, several large dragonfish thrashing violently on the water-soaked floor, their tails slapping against it with a splashing sound. In the vast office, this made everything seem even more desolate and oppressive.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei searched around and finally found Hao Xinmei huddled behind the half-person-high desk.</p><p>"Xiao Mei!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's heart felt like it was being cut by a knife.</p><p>His Xiao Mei, that proud swan, now appeared emaciated and fragile, as if she could shatter with just a light touch.</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei's voice, Hao Xinmei slowly raised her head. Her exquisite face bore signs of weariness, fatigue, and confusion.</p><p>She didn't cry!</p><p>In recent years, she had forgotten that some things could still be vented through tears. </p><p>She looked at Zhu Tianlei, at the man she hadn't seen in over half a month, whose face seemed even more handsome and resolute. She wanted to speak but found her voice stuck in her throat, unable to utter a word.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei could no longer endure it and hugged Hao Xinmei tightly.</p><p>"Little Mei, don't be afraid, I'm here! Don't be afraid, sweetie!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's voice was gentle, as if a breeze could scatter his words.</p><p>Hao Xinmei listened to Zhu Tianlei's voice dazedly, feeling the warmth of his body. She cautiously extended her hand and slowly wrapped it around Zhu Tianlei's waist.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained motionless; he knew that at this moment, Hao Xinmei needed nothing but company.</p><p>After an indeterminate amount of time, Hao Xinmei lifted her head from Zhu Tianlei's embrace.</p><p>"Tianlei, I'm so tired!"</p><p>At twenty-three years old, Hao Xinmei felt as if she had lived a lifetime.</p><p>Through the years of gunfire and deceit, she had endured bravely because she wanted to make a name for herself, to become strong. Only by being strong could she control her own destiny and not be trampled upon by others.</p><p>But now, she was tired. She was a woman, still young, in what should have been the time to fully enjoy youth and indulge freely. Why did she have to live such a strenuous life?</p><p>"Little Mei, there's me! No matter what happens, I'll always be here!"</p><p>In recent years, she had forgotten that some things could still be released through tears.</p><p>She looked at Zhu Tianlei, the man she hadn't seen in over half a month. His face seemed even more handsome and resolute. She wanted to speak, but her voice got stuck in her throat, unable to escape.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei could no longer bear it and hugged Hao Xinmei tightly.</p><p>"Little Mei, don't be afraid, I'm here! Don't be afraid, sweetie!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's voice was gentle, as if a breeze could scatter his words.</p><p>Hao Xinmei listened to Zhu Tianlei's voice dazedly, feeling the warmth of his body. She cautiously extended her hand and slowly wrapped it around Zhu Tianlei's waist.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained motionless; he knew that at this moment, Hao Xinmei needed nothing but company.</p><p>After an indeterminate amount of time, Hao Xinmei lifted her head from Zhu Tianlei's embrace.</p><p>"Tianlei, I'm so tired!"</p><p>At twenty-three years old, Hao Xinmei felt as if she had lived a lifetime.</p><p>Through the years of gunfire and deceit, she had endured bravely because she wanted to make a name for herself, to become strong.

Don't be scared, sweetie!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's voice was gentle, as if a breeze could dissipate his words.</p><p>Hao Xinmei listened to Zhu Tianlei's soothing voice, feeling the warmth of his body. She cautiously extended her hand and slowly wrapped it around Zhu Tianlei's waist.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained still; he knew that at this moment, Hao Xinmei needed nothing but his presence.</p><p>After what felt like an eternity, Hao Xinmei lifted her head from Zhu Tianlei's embrace.</p><p>"Tianlei, I'm so tired!"</p><p>At twenty-three, Hao Xinmei felt as if she had lived a lifetime.</p><p>Through the years of gunfire and deceit, she had endured bravely because she wanted to make a name for herself and become strong. Only by being strong could she control her own destiny and not be trampled upon by others.</p><p>But now, she was exhausted. She was a woman, still young, in what should have been the time to fully enjoy youth and indulge freely. Why did she have to live such a strenuous life?</p><p>"Little Mei, I'm here! No matter what happens, I'll always be with you!"</p>

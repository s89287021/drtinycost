						<p>The woman looked at Zhu Tianlei, the 'hero brother' in Xiao Gangpeng's heart. Despite his young age, his face was filled with determination as she nodded her head.</p><p>"Sister, you and Xiao Gangpeng will stay at Tianlei Pharmaceuticals for now. I want Yang Zhongmin to bow and apologize to Xiao Gangpeng!"</p><p>The word "apologize" was said heavily by Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Then, without stopping, he walked straight towards the few people still lying on the ground. Terrified to their core, they all wished they could find a crack in the earth to crawl into when they saw Zhu Tianlei approaching.</p><p>"Ladies and gentlemen, fellow villagers, I, Zhu Tianlei, deeply apologize for everything that happened today. The New Year's gathering is hereby ended. Later, I will arrange for our public relations department to prepare gifts for everyone as a token of my sincerity. Now, I must go seek revenge for Xiao Gangpeng!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei bowed towards the crowd.</p><p>"Follow me to the county government building. Jianxiong, lend me a hand!"</p><p>After finishing his words, Zhu Tianlei left in big strides, his figure resolute.</p><p>In the Deputy Mayor's office of the County Government Building.</p><p>Yang Zhongmin smoked incessantly, pacing back and forth in the room, glancing at his phone every few seconds.</p><p>Xiao Yu stood at the door, hesitating for a long time before finally mustering up the courage to knock on the already open door.</p><p>"County Mayor Yang, Chairman Sun has called several times asking when you will arrive."</p><p>Xiao Yu asked cautiously, not knowing why County Mayor Yang seemed like a different person since returning from the county hospital. What was once a smiling tiger had turned into a cannon, and Xiao Yu felt that the past two or three months were longer than the previous two years.</p><p>"Hurry hurry hurry, what are you rushing for? Tell him to wait; if he keeps pestering me, forget about getting anything done!"</p><p>"Oh, understood!"</p><p>Although Xiao Yu did not understand why Yang Zhongmin was so furious, he deeply grasped one thing: speak less and do more. Do not look at or ask about things that should not be seen or known.</p><p>Yang Zhongmin watched Xiu Mingzhe's retreating figure, his frustration growing by the minute. He couldn't even smoke properly and ended up throwing the cigarette on the ground, stomping it into pieces with his foot.</p><p>It felt as if he were stepping not on a cigarette butt, but on Zhu Tianlei himself.</p><p>In recent days, Fang Yun had taken Xiu Mingzhe to virtually every renowned hospital in the country, only to receive more or less the same response: Xiu Mingzhe had completely lost function in that area. Even medical equipment showed no abnormalities.</p><p>Moreover, because John had spoken ill of him before leaving to city leaders, Yang Zhongmin had been met with nothing but adversity over these past few months. Those who once scrambled to curry favor with him now avoided him like a plague.</p><p>Think about it: from an office clerk to his current position, how much effort and hardship had he endured? Now all of it was ruined by Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>So even in dreams, Yang Zhongmin wanted nothing more than to tear Zhu Tianlei into pieces.</p><p>Finally, the opportunity had arrived. Someone willing to take a stand, someone willing to send Zhu Tianlei to hell.</p><p>Today was Zhu Tianlei's day in hell. He felt both tense and anxious, constantly checking his phone, waiting for news of victory.</p><p>But time seemed too long......</p><p>"Hello? Who are you? This is the county government compound; no unauthorized entry!"</p><p>The county government compound was temporary. The new compound was under construction in a new district of Daheli Development Zone but had yet to be completed. Thus, there was only an old guard at the gatehouse.</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei enter, Old Zhang hurried out.</p><p>For some reason, Old Zhang, who had lived most of his life, felt nervous upon seeing the young man for the first time. However, guarding was his duty, so he braced himself and came out.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't say a word, simply walking straight in.</p><p>Old Zhang tried to stop him but, as he neared Zhu Tianlei, he felt a surge of energy emanating from the younger man. His legs went weak, and he could barely move. In that instant, Zhu Tianlei had vanished at the entrance of the office building.</p><p>A van then roared up behind them.</p><p>Old Zhang was smart this time, directly hiding in the guardhouse.</p><p>As a gatekeeper, he didn’t need to risk his life for 1500 yuan a month.</p><p>"You... County Secretary Yang is not here..."</p><p>Hearing footsteps in the corridor, Xiao Yu peeked out of the door. When he saw that it was Zhu Tianlei, he shivered involuntarily.</p><p>Recalling Yang Zhongmin’s previous instructions, even though he was afraid, he followed Yang Zhongmin’s orders and said so.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei recognized Xiao Yu; although he was full of anger, he didn’t want to involve others. He only gave Xiao Yu a cold look before heading straight for the deputy county secretary’s office.</p><p>Although young, Xiao Yu was sharp-minded and clearly knew that Zhu Tianlei was no good person. He didn’t want to provoke him, so after Zhu Tianlei left, he quickly retreated into the room. After thinking for a moment, he even locked the office door from the inside.</p><p>"County Secretary Yang!"</p><p>Hearing the voice at the door, Yang Zhongmin turned around in surprise and joy.</p><p>"Did you get it done?"</p><p>However, in the next second, his body flew up with a thud and slammed against the bookshelf door beside the sofa. The large bookshelf trembled, causing the doors to open, and books scattered all over the floor.</p><p>New books such as “Letters from Zeng Guofan,” “Li Hongzhang’s Biography,” and “The Art of Intrigue” fell on Yang Zhongmin, forming a stark contrast with his chubby face.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>When he clearly saw that the person standing in front of him was Zhu Tianlei, Yang Zhongmin was so shocked that he forgot about the pain in his body.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, how could he be here?</p><p>Wasn't he supposed to be fiercely berated by the crowd, pointed at by thousands, or arrested as a murderer and taken to the police station?</p><p>But Zhu Tianlei didn't feel like listening to him anymore. He raised his hand and grabbed Yang Zhongmin, throwing him out again with great force. This time, Yang Zhongmin's head hit the corner of the sofa, causing a triangular gash from which blood gushed out.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you are truly audacious. Where is this? It's the county government office, an official state agency. You actually create such a scene here. Are you seeking more comfort in your life?"</p><p>After a brief shock, Yang Zhongmin suddenly became excited.</p><p>Great! This was a perfect opportunity. Zhu Tianlei had dared to cause trouble at the county government office. This was an unforgivable crime. If he didn't bring down Zhu Tianlei this time, it would be heaven's justice!</p><p>Now, let the senior proofreader take over to review and correct this draft.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, how could he be here?</p><p>Shouldn't he have been viciously condemned by the crowd, vilified by everyone, or arrested as a murderer and taken to the police station?</p><p>But Zhu Tianlei was in no mood to listen. He raised his hand, grabbed Yang Zhongmin, and threw him out forcefully once more. This time, Yang Zhongmin's head hit the corner of the sofa, causing a triangular gash from which blood spurted.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you are truly audacious. This is the county government office, an official state agency. You actually created such a scene here. Are you seeking more comfort in your life?"</p><p>After a brief shock, Yang Zhongmin suddenly became excited.</p><p>Great! This was a perfect opportunity. Zhu Tianlei had dared to cause trouble at the county government office. This crime was unforgivable. If he didn't bring down Zhu Tianlei this time, it would be heaven's justice!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained silent. All he could see in front of him were Little Gangbing's faces—smiling, happy, crying, pouting—and those pale, bloodless like paper money...</p><p>Now, let the copywriter take over to refine and enhance this draft.</p><p>How could Zhu Tianlei be here?</p><p>Shouldn't he have been viciously condemned by the crowd, vilified by everyone, or arrested as a murderer and taken to the police station?</p><p>But Zhu Tianlei was in no mood to listen.

Zhu Tianlei had dared to cause trouble at the county government office—an unforgivable crime.

						<p>"You are suffering from solanine poisoning."</p><p>What? Poisoning?</p><p>Upon hearing the word 'poisoning,' everyone's eyes widened. They had been eating meals at the cafeteria and getting water from the water room every day, so they couldn't understand how they could be poisoned.</p><p>"Tianlei, we are all rough guys and don't know what solanine is. Please explain to us what exactly is happening!"</p><p>"Solanine is......"</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was about to speak, he saw Liuzi, who had been unresponsive until then, suddenly collapse to the ground, foaming at the mouth.</p><p>"Liuzi, Liuzi......"</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>Liuzi was in his mid-20s and had been one of the first batch to join. Although this boy wasn't particularly astute, he was very honest and always volunteered for tasks. Given Liuzi's background, everyone felt quite sympathetic towards him.</p><p>Seeing Liuzi foaming at the mouth and unconscious now naturally made everyone panicky.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took his pulse.</p><p>"He is also poisoned. Step aside, I will treat him with acupuncture."</p><p>Everyone had witnessed the miraculous effects of Baiqing Wan and thus had no doubt about Zhu Tianlei's medical skills. They quickly moved to either side.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned Liuzi over and then used a silver needle.</p><p>"Miraculous! Liuzi is not convulsing anymore."</p><p>Ruan Liang exclaimed in amazement.</p><p>"Tianlei, am I going to die?"</p><p>After a moment, Liuzi opened his eyes, and the first thing he said made Zhu Tianlei's nose turn sour.</p><p>"What does Liuzi say, what nonsense about dying or not, you're fine!"</p><p>Ruan Liang also felt uneasy in his heart and tried to comfort him.</p><p>"Once dead, I won't have to starve anymore......"</p><p>Liuzi's words made the entire 309 silent.</p><p>"Liuzi's spleen and stomach have been severely damaged due to frequent starvation followed by binge eating. No matter how much he eats, he won't feel full. Similarly, although he has been poisoned like everyone else, his reaction time is much slower, making it the same principle. His digestive system is worse than that of a seventy-year-old."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei slowly stated his diagnosis.</p><p>Yan Dada silent for a moment before suddenly punching the wall.</p><p>"Damn bitch, she deserves to be killed!"</p><p>Liuzi stared with wide eyes at the ceiling, lost in thought.</p><p>"Come on, come on, let's go work!"</p><p>At 2 PM, with a slam, the iron door opened, and the supervisor responsible for this area poked his head out and shouted.</p><p>"I quit!"</p><p>Yan Dada mumbled.</p><p>"Yes, we quit. We are collectively suffering from food poisoning and can't get up!"</p><p>"Are you guys planning to rebel? Do you not want any scores for this quarter’s evaluation?"</p><p>"Bullshit scores, my life almost cost me everything. Let the devil judge those scores!"</p><p>The affable Yan Dada, who had been in front of Zhu Tianlei and everyone else, disappeared; now emerged was the intimidating presence of a gang boss.</p><p>"Well then, it seems you all have been enjoying smooth sailing lately. Ruan Liang, with your performance, do you really think the detention center will provide you with proof for your appeal? Dream on."</p><p>Ruan Liang's face turned pale.</p><p>He had committed accidental harm and there was a wide range of sentencing possibilities; one of the criteria that could influence sentencing was the testimony from the detention center.</p><p>However, looking at his gang members sprawled around in disarray, Ruan Liang clenched his teeth.</p><p>"Hmph, whether you go to court or not is your business. Anyway, I’m calling it quits today and I’ll file a complaint against these corrupt police officers for serving us poisonous food!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had assumed that Ruan Liang, as his name suggested, was a spineless coward who would cave under pressure. He hadn’t expected Ruan Liang to display such valor in critical moments.</p><p>"Alright, alright, it seems you all are truly itching for a fight. Wait, you’ll regret this soon enough!"</p><p>The bailiff, infuriated, saw stars and slammed the door shut with a bang before quickly retreating.</p><p>"Tianlei, if not for you, our lives would have been forfeit. These bastards don’t even consider us human beings!"</p><p>After venting their frustration, Yan Dada’s intimidating demeanor began to subside.</p><p>In reality, everyone knew that they were just meat on the chopping block, waiting to be slaughtered.</p><p>"Don’t worry; they’ll pay for it."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said coolly.</p><p>He didn't care what wrong these people had done, but they were locked up here and would face legal judgment later. Even if it meant a death sentence, that was the price they should pay. However, before then, they were still human beings and deserved fair treatment.</p><p>Especially......</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at Liuzi again. The foolish boy had been staring at the ceiling ever since he woke up.</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>The iron door opened once more.</p><p>Seven or eight guards brandishing batons charged in.</p><p>"I'll give you one last chance, will you leave?"</p><p>It was the guard who had come and gone before who spoke this time.</p><p>"We're not leaving! If you have the guts, kill me!"</p><p>Yan Datou was someone who wasn't intimidated even with a knife at his throat. Even facing such blatant threats, he showed no fear.</p><p>"Right, if you have the guts, kill us all. In any case, we'll die sooner or later; it's better to go early and be reborn."</p><p>"Alright, this is your doing. Attack!"</p><p>At the leading guard's command, several of them immediately swung their batons towards Yan Datou and the others.</p><p>Suddenly, a black shadow darted by. Before the guards could react, the batons slipped out of their hands and clattered to the ground.</p><p>When they focused again, they saw Zhu Tianlei standing before them.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei gripped a baton, staring coldly at the crowd.</p><p>"Is it you?"</p><p>The lead bailiff glanced at Zhu Tianlei, and surprise flashed across his eyes.</p><p>"It's me."</p><p>The other party recognizing him was no surprise to Zhu Tianlei. After all, appearing here out of nowhere meant someone must have tipped them off beforehand.</p><p>"I'm telling you, you'd better not get involved in this matter. They are all death row inmates and serious criminals; they will die sooner or later anyway."</p><p>"This is my business, and whether they live or die isn't up to you; it's the law that decides."</p><p>"You... don't think you're so great, do you? To be honest with you, if you could end up here, you could also be eliminated silently. Do you believe me?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at him and suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p>"I don't believe you!"</p><p>Saying this, Zhu Tianlei suddenly picked up the baton. The bailiff was scared and immediately took two steps back, but Zhu Tianlei did not attack him. Instead, he slowly bent the baton and then folded it in half until...</p><p>With a snap, the baton snapped into two pieces.</p><p>Yan Datou swallowed hard.</p><p>Who on earth is this Zhu Tianlei!</p><p>"How about it, still want to fight?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei threw the broken baton on the ground and asked softly.</p><p>"You...... do you know that damaging a police baton is illegal......"</p><p>"I only know that abusing suspects with private punishment is breaking the law."</p><p>"Alright, alright, alright, you have guts. But remember, from now on, don't think you'll have an easy life!"</p><p>"Remember your own words; don't cry and beg me to let you out later!"</p><p>"Haha, what a joke. I'm a guard, and you're a prisoner. It's you who has to ask me for favors, not the other way around. Hahaha, that's wishful thinking, pure fantasy!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at this person meaningfully.</p>

						<p>"You are Jiang Xing, I have remembered!"</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>Jiang Xing had been a prison guard for three years and had handled hundreds of inmates, but none were as impressive as Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained silent and leaned against the bed, closing his eyes.</p><p>"Hmph, we're riding the donkey to watch the opera; we'll see!"</p><p>Feeling offended by being completely ignored by Zhu Tianlei, Jiang Xing was also quite fearful of him. Thus, he bluffed to save some face before leading several prison guards out in a grand manner.</p><p>Yan Datou and the others were thoroughly impressed with Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Tianlei, it's a pity you didn't go out and make your name; with your skills and courage, apart from Black Eagle Gang's Old Master Ge, there's no one who can match you."</p><p>Upon hearing of Big Eagle Ge, Zhu Tianlei curled the corners of his mouth.</p><p>Big Eagle Ge probably wouldn't dare to provoke him either!</p><p>"However, Tianlei, you offended that Jiang Xing brat just now. Things will be tough for you from now on. Don't underestimate him; though he's just a prison guard, his background is far from mediocre and he's particularly malicious with many cunning schemes. You... sigh..."</p><p>Yan Datou was genuinely worried about Zhu Tianlei, as everyone knew that Zhu Tianlei had been doing it all to stand up for them.</p><p>"Don't worry, I said before, I'll make him beg me to get out of here!"</p><p>Yan Datou didn't speak but inwardly doubted it. If Zhu Tianlei really had such abilities, he wouldn't be inside.</p><p>However, just after three o'clock in the afternoon, the iron gate was abruptly flung open again.</p><p>Jiang Xing entered with two people.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei propped his feet up on the table, listening to Ruan Li recounting his glorious days as a gangster in Beicheng. When Xing Jiang walked in, he didn't even flick an eyelid.</p><p>However, Yan Datou immediately became vigilant and instinctively moved in front of Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>To say that Xing Jiang was a petty person who held grudges was an understatement.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at Xing Jiang but ignored him.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, you see, there was a misunderstanding earlier. I didn't understand the situation properly. Please don't hold it against me, Doctor Zhu!" Yan Datou's body trembled, and goosebumps covered his skin.</p><p>Heavens, is Xing Jiang possessed by a devil?!</p><p>"What do you want?"</p><p>"Cough cough, I came to pick up Doctor Zhu."</p><p>Xing Jiang plastered a smile on his face, but it looked incredibly forced. The faces of the two accompanying bailiffs also seemed somewhat embarrassed.</p><p>"Pick up? Why?"</p><p>"Eh......"</p><p>Xing Jiang was choked and couldn't speak. However, thinking about the phone call he had just received, he gritted his teeth and pressed forward.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, I know my actions were inappropriate before, it was my mistake. I admit to it. If you're not comfortable, feel free to curse me or hit me to vent your anger. After all, this is a detention center; it's better to get out early!"</p><p>Xing Jiang was even more arrogant before, and now he regrets it immensely.</p><p>Truly, his bloodline had run dry for eight generations; he had to put this devil into the prison under his jurisdiction.</p><p>"I remember someone not long ago saying that I am a prisoner, and where would prisoners be if not in a detention center?"</p><p>Yan Dabao almost couldn't help laughing as he heard Zhu Tianlei's words.</p><p>The others also felt very satisfied and gave Zhu Tianlei an imaginary round of applause in their hearts.</p><p>"It was my nonsense, nonsense..."</p><p>Xing Jiang nearly cried.</p><p>"I think this place is fine; except for the toxic food, everything else is good enough..."</p><p>"Doctor Zhu..."</p><p>Xing Jiang was about to speak again when his phone rang. He picked up the call, but he didn't know what was said on the other end. Only to see Xing Jiang's face turn increasingly pale, and as soon as he hung up, Xing Jiang suddenly knelt in front of Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, please, please come with me right away. It was my fault for being shortsighted earlier; I overestimated myself. I deserve..."</p><p>Having finished speaking, Xing Jiang slapped himself hard on the face, leaving a red handprint almost immediately.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood up and grabbed Xing Jiang's wrist. Xing Jiang shuddered in fear.</p><p>"Get up, the state has you wear this police uniform for serving people, not for kneeling!"</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei exerted some force, and Xing Jiang stood up.</p><p>"Xing Jiang, remember, prisoners are also human beings. Whenever you think of harming them again, keep my words in mind."</p><p>"Yes, yes, yes!"</p><p>Seeing that Zhu Tianlei did not touch him, Xing Jiang heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>"Big Brother Yan, I'm leaving now. We'll meet again!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei bowed to Yan Datou, who had developed some camaraderie with him despite spending only a few hours together.</p><p>Yan Datou nodded. Although he knew Zhu Tianlei's words were polite, he still felt somewhat excited. Zhu Tianlei's arrival had brought an unusual atmosphere to Block 309.</p><p>Before leaving, Zhu Tianlei took one last look at Liuzi, who was still sitting there motionless, and then strode out.</p><p>Xing Jiang, feeling relieved, quickly followed him.</p><p>"This way..."</p><p>Xing Jiang led Zhu Tianlei towards the exit. At the gatehouse, he removed Zhu Tianlei's custody-specific vest and pushed open the heavy iron door.</p><p>A black Hongqi sedan was parked outside.</p><p>"Xing Jiang, see you later!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not even inquire about who was in the car before opening the door and getting in.</p><p>Xing Jiang patted his chest.</p><p>See you later?</p><p>Better if we never see each other again, not even passing by.</p><p>"Is it you?"</p><p>The person sitting in the car was none other than Mao Fang.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, I'm sorry. It was my mistake to accuse you earlier. I just didn't expect them to be so bold and audacious, even going as far as secretly disobeying orders and imprisoning Doctor Zhu. But don't worry, Doctor Zhu, I will absolutely not let this slide."</p><p>Although it was just one sentence, Zhu Tianlei understood clearly. It turned out that his summons by the police was ordered by Mao Fang, but someone had intervened midway, disregarding Mao Fang's instructions and having him imprisoned.</p><p>"Tell me, what happened to the patient?"</p><p>Mao Fang was taken aback and then felt somewhat embarrassed; she hadn't expected Zhu Tianlei to be so straightforward.</p><p>"To be frank, after Doctor Zhu gave Old Joe an acupuncture treatment yesterday, he recovered very well. In the evening, he even had a bowl of congee. However, in the early hours of the morning, he suddenly turned pale and foamed at the mouth, necessitating another emergency room visit..."</p><p>Thinking back to what happened that morning, Mao Fang still felt shaken.</p><p>"So Director Mao thinks it was me who tampered with something?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at Mao Fang, speaking without any hint of subtlety. Fortunately, Mao Fang had a good temperament and didn't get angry again because of this.</p><p>"I was also too hasty at the time, but I only arranged for them to summon Doctor Zhu to the police station; I absolutely did not instruct them to imprison you."</p><p>When Mao Fang heard that Zhu Tianlei wasn't at the police station but in custody, she almost exploded with anger.</p><p>Fortunately, her reaction was quick, and she arrived on the scene promptly. Otherwise, she would have felt guilty towards Zhu Tianlei, and Old Joe would have been disgraced as well.</p><p>Her husband's honor meant more to her than her own life; she couldn't afford any mistakes.</p><p>"So Director Mao, are you here because you've figured something out or to ask me to treat the patient?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pressed further.</p>

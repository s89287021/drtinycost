						<p>Hagama Gou.</p><p>Because of the warm and humid climate, it became a paradise for various toads. Half of the villagers living in Hagama Gou made their living by catching and selling toads.</p><p>In August, it was the best season for catching toads.</p><p>Inside a small cave north of Hagama Gou, faint rustling sounds could be heard.</p><p>"Sister-in-law, it's pitch-black here; I don't think there are any toads!"</p><p>The speaker was Zhu Tianlei, the only son of Zhu Zeqizi in Hagama Gou. He was twenty-two years old.</p><p>"Don't you believe me? When have I ever told a lie?"</p><p>The woman speaking this time was named Zhang Yuntao, but in Hagama Gou, everyone called her Aunt Zhang Yuntao, the widow.</p><p>"Tianlei, it feels like something bit me. Can you take a look at me!"</p><p>In the cave, Aunt Zhang grabbed Zhu Tianlei's large hand and placed it on her chest. On such a hot day, she was wearing only a floral blouse without any undergarment. When Zhu Tianlei's hand touched the two lumps of flesh on Aunt Zhang's chest, his mind went blank.</p><p>"Tianlei, this tickling sensation is right here... go a little deeper... mmm... yes, that's it..."</p><p>Aunt Zhang pulled Zhu Tianlei's hand and inserted it through her collar. Her throat kept emitting sounds that made Zhu Tianlei feel like he was losing control.</p><p>"Sister-in-law, I......I......"</p><p>"Shh, don't call me sister-in-law, call me Yuntao......."</p><p>Aunt Zhang's body curled up on Zhu Tianlei's like a snake. The faint fragrance of her mixed with sweat made Zhu Tianlei, who had never experienced such sensations before, lose all control. He hugged Aunt Zhang tightly and lifted her blouse with his hands.</p><p>In the dimly lit cave, the two white lumps on Aunt Zhang's chest instantly ignited the fire within Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Tiānlěi, my sister-in-law can't help it either. Don't blame her!"</p><p>Just as Zhū Tiānlěi was about to lower his head to conquer Chén Gūfù's two snow-white globes, he heard her words and found them strange.</p><p>Strange?</p><p>What did she mean by that?</p><p>"Sister-in-law, what are you d......."</p><p>Before the word could come out of his mouth, Zhū Tiānlěi felt a pain on the back of his head and collapsed onto Chén Gūfù's body.</p><p>Zhāng Yúntáo quickly threw the bloody stone to the side, looking tense and fearful. However, her actions were swift as she used both hands to push Zhū Tiānlěi off her body to the ground and then cautiously reached out towards Zhū Tiānlěi's nose.</p><p>No breath!</p><p>Zhāng Yúntáo took a deep breath and rushed out of the cave without looking back.</p><p>She didn't notice that the stone, carelessly thrown aside, emitted a faint fluorescence. The fresh blood seemed to be summoned by some force, quickly seeping into the stone. The light shot like an arrow, instantly vanishing into Zhū Tiānlěi's body.</p><p>The seemingly lifeless Zhū Tiānlěi slowly exhaled a white aura from his chest. The aura gradually became ethereal, like a cloud, enveloping Zhū Tiānlěi completely.</p><p>"I, Purple-hair Medical Immortal, have waited for hundreds of years and finally got someone! 'Spiritual Medicine Immortal Techniques' has an heir! Kid, practice well, don't bring shame to your old man!"</p><p>In a dreamlike state, an elderly man in a tannish robe appeared before Zhū Tiānlěi. He had white hair and the face of a child, waved at him, and a beam of golden light flashed into Zhū Tiānlěi's body like lightning.</p><p>After a long while, Zhū Tiānlěi, lying on the ground, slowly opened his eyes.</p><p>"Chén Gūfù, daring to ambush me!"</p><p>Zhū Tiānlěi sat up. After a brief fit of anger, his mind was gradually filled with confusion.</p><p>He had no beef with Ms. Chen; on the contrary, their relationship was quite amiable. It was precisely because of this that when Ms. Chen told him there was a toad lair in the gourd cave, he followed her over.</p><p>He carefully recalled Ms. Chen's actions before and after, clearly indicating that she had been scheming all along.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood up, subconsciously rubbing the back of his head, and cursed Ms. Chen again in his heart. They say women have the most vicious hearts; it turned out to be true that she was not messing with him.</p><p>"Whoa?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei suddenly froze, eyes wide in disbelief.</p><p>His scalp was smooth and unblemished; there wasn't even a bump, let alone a bloody hole.</p><p>This defied logic. And at the moment he lost consciousness, he was certain he felt blood spurting out.</p><p>Could it be...</p><p>Zhu Tianlei suddenly remembered that dream-like scene just now. Could it have really happened?</p><p>He closed his eyes, and sure enough, a multitude of unfamiliar images immediately flooded his mind, chaotic and jumbled like scattered flowers in the air. However, these images gradually converged, slowly transforming into a book, with the words "Spiritual Medicine Divine Techniques" boldly inscribed on its pages.</p><p>The Spiritual Medicine Divine Techniques seemed to sense Zhu Tianlei's consciousness and automatically activated...</p><p>The Spiritual Medicine Divine Techniques used celestial essence energy as a guide, unblocking meridians, expelling evil, benefiting the body, combining medicine and martial arts, complementing each other.</p><p>...</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was somewhat bewildered, but the wound on the back of his head that healed automatically proved that everything was real.</p><p>"Hahaha, I'm going to get rich, haha!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was overjoyed, raising both hands and shouting loudly.</p><p>"Quack quack quack......"</p><p>A chorus of frogs croaked in response, as if in harmony with Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was in a good mood, considering himself fortunate. A smile played on his lips, and he noticed that his vision seemed to have suddenly become much stronger. What had been a pitch-black cave now appeared bright as day to him.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei straightened his clothes and walked out confidently.</p><p>The two men's eyes widened instantly. Chen Guafu was twenty-six or twenty-seven, in the prime of her youth. She always dressed up well and put on airs; no matter whether the village men were elderly bachelors, young unmarried boys, or married men like Li Fugui and Zhang Haisan, they all lusted after her.</p><p>"Brother Li, Brother Zhang, someone......someone got killed......"</p><p>Chen Guafu had already planned what to say. Her nervousness and fear were genuine; she was truly frightened, especially recalling the feeling of Zhu Tianlei falling onto her body. Her heart raced with fear.</p><p>"What? Say it again!"</p><p>Hearing Chen Guafu's words, all the men's lecherous thoughts vanished. Li Fugui propped himself up on his hoe and stood abruptly, his face tinged with purple.</p><p>"I saw......Zhu Tianlei......"</p><p>Chen Guafu was breathless. Although she had rehearsed countless times in her mind, practice was different from real life.</p><p>"Hurry up and tell us what happened!"</p><p>Li Fugui was the village's most capable person, even more so than the village chief. Virtually everything depended on him. Hearing this news only made him excited to the point that he could barely form words.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei killed Hu Dainiu!</p>

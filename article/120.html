						<p>The mayor? The deputy mayor? The city's leadership team?</p><p>These were figures as distant and unattainable as gods, now suddenly appearing before them. Could the young Zhu be a reincarnated god?</p><p>"Everyone, this way!"</p><p>Mao Yu's heart was racing with shock. Zhu Tianlei had never told her that he knew these people, let alone that they would be so familiar to him.</p><p>But she was still Mao Yu. Despite her surprise, she quickly regained composure.</p><p> Yao Gang and several village cadres had already taken their positions, but the sudden turn of events left them at a loss for what to do.</p><p>Officialdom is hierarchical; one rank can overshadow another, let alone several ranks!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei calmed himself.</p><p>"Tianlei, should we have the city's leaders do the ribbon-cutting?"</p><p>Mao Yu whispered to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Yes, Tianlei, let's go down; Mayor Yang and Mayor Wu can do the honors!"</p><p>Yao Gang also joined in. He wasn't one to let overconfidence get ahead of himself when a big boss was around; they were mere clerks with no right to push themselves forward.</p><p>"No need, we'll proceed as planned. I will explain it to Mayor Yang and the others afterward."</p><p>Since Zhu Tianlei put it that way, Mao Yu and Yao Gang did not press further. However, during the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Yao Gang felt his hands shaking.</p><p>The opening ceremony proceeded smoothly. In the end, Yang Wenjie stood up and insisted on saying a few words. Mao Yu was more than happy for this; it would greatly benefit Tianlei Pharmaceutical's future development.</p><p>As Mayor Yang Wenjie finished speaking, thunderous applause and cheers resounded around him.</p><p>Although this honor was bestowed upon Zhu Tianlei, all the villagers felt proud as if it were a reflection on their community—Hama Gou—and every village within the Greater Qing Mountain region.</p><p>After Mayor Yang Wenjie and his entourage left under the eyes of everyone present, Zhu Tianlei noticed that his father and mother were sitting in a corner, staring intently at him.</p><p>"Dad, Mom, what's going on with you two?"</p><p>Zhu Quezi snapped back to reality. Looking at his son's handsome face, he couldn't help but wonder: Is this really my child? The one I've watched grow up, who has caused me so much trouble except for urinating and getting into mischief?</p><p>Hou Suqin was similar to Zhu Quezi; since Mayor Yang Wenjie and his group appeared, her mind had been clouded throughout the entire ceremony.</p><p>"Tianlei, Mom must be dreaming, right?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but laugh. Of course, he knew exactly how his parents were feeling.</p><p>"Dad, Mom, this is all real. Your son is no longer that unruly young punk."</p><p>Seeing this scene, several women also felt their eyes welling up with emotion.</p><p>The next day, Tianlei Pharmaceutical officially commenced operations. Tu Feng and Han Lin both chose to work at Tianlei Pharmaceutical; Han Lin remained in his field as the Human Resources Manager, while Tu Feng took on the role of Head of the Planning Department.</p><p>True to his professional background in human resources, Han Lin did not disappoint in terms of expertise and execution. A week before the grand opening, he had managed to recruit all staff members and prepare everything from corporate structure to job descriptions and compensation packages.</p><p>Tu Feng's work capabilities were already strong, and coupled with his gratitude for Zhu Tianlei saving his life, he worked tirelessly. In just a few days, he led three employees in the Planning Department to complete the initial drafts of the company website, app, and brand manual.</p><p>In the factory, machinery roared to life.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had never mentioned the herbal fields near Xiaohexi to anyone except his womenfolk. However, relying solely on sneaking up into the mountains every day to gather raw materials was inefficient and would eventually be discovered.</p><p>But this matter, he indeed did not want too many people to know. However, who should handle this matter troubled Zhu Tianlei immensely.</p><p>Until, he remembered Yao Jianxiong, who is now also an employee at Tianlei Pharmaceutical. Although this young man was young, he was very intelligent and diligent in his work. Mao Yu had praised Yao Jianxiong on more than one occasion.</p><p>This child is worthy of trust.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei told Yao Jianxiong about the matter, Yao Jianxiong appeared somewhat nervous at first, but quickly recovered his composure, pounding his chest to assure Zhu Tianlei that he would definitely get the job done. Of course, what "getting the job done" meant was only known to Zhu Tianlei and Yao Jianxiong.</p><p>"Tianlei, quick look, this is our first batch of 'Beauty Pills.'"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was flipping through a map of Yunhai City pharmacies on his computer when Mao Yu walked in with a box in hand.</p><p>The box was overturned, and boxes labeled with the words "Beauty Pill" scattered across the desktop.</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei had seen this packaging countless times, he was still overcome with excitement at that moment.</p><p>"Tianlei, we have repeatedly tested the efficacy of Beauty Pills. I believe once they are launched, they will definitely cause a sensation. The first shot from Tianlei Pharmaceutical will be very successful."</p><p>Mao Yu was visibly excited.</p><p>However, Zhu Tianlei's gaze gradually dimmed.</p><p>"Tianlei, what's wrong? Has something happened?"</p><p>"The few pharmacies we had previously contacted all refused to act as agents for our Beauty Pills."</p><p>"Why would they do that? Didn't we already reach a cooperation agreement with them?"</p><p>Mao Yu found it hard to believe, as Zhu Tianlei had just mentioned this matter to her yesterday.</p><p>"In the morning, when I called to confirm, they only changed their minds then. Because we wanted to test the market first and see how the sales went, Mao Yu did not launch a large-scale promotional campaign; instead, he chose just a few pharmacies in the county for trial sales. Therefore, no cooperation agreements were signed. However, we didn't expect such a situation to arise in the end. 'Tianlei, have these pharmacies all refused?' 'Yes, I know what you're suspecting. To be honest, I feel the same way; this is too suspicious. If it was just one or two pharmacies, it could be understood, but for them all to renege together, there must definitely be a problem. No matter how much I asked, none of the pharmacy managers would explain the reason.' Mao Yu's expression also turned grim. The joy and excitement from earlier were instantly dampened, eventually fading away completely. 'Tianlei, don't panic yet; let's think of another way. There's always a way out. At worst, we can delay the launch for a few more days.'"</p>

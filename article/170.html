						<p>These cotton swabs seemed to have eyes, dodging important organs and targeting the weakest and most painful spots on their bodies with pinpoint accuracy. Unbeknownst to them, several teenagers were driven out of the room.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei moved his foot slightly, and shadows flickered as he shut the ward door like a whirlwind, locking it with a snap.</p><p>"Rest assured, I will cure your father. He needs proper rest now, so go back home. Otherwise, your father won't be able to recover in peace!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke through the door in a low voice.</p><p>"Open the door! If you don’t open it, I’ll smash it down!"</p><p>It was still the voice of the first teenager.</p><p>"You don’t have the strength for that. Go back home now! Zhu Tianlei keeps his word!"</p><p>"Are you Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>The teenager’s voice clearly showed surprise.</p><p>"Yes, my name is Zhu Tianlei!"</p><p>"Alright, we’re leaving then!"</p><p>Following this, a series of stomping footsteps echoed as the several teenagers indeed left.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was quite puzzled; did they recognize him?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned around to look at Li Yong coldly.</p><p>Li Yong lowered his head in guilt.</p><p>"Brother Li, what’s going on here?"</p><p>Li Yong told him that Wei Baoguo took this matter very seriously and had arranged everything as he suggested. However, several teenagers walked in arrogantly, which only proved that there was no one guarding the place at all.</p><p>"Tiand Lei, I......"</p><p>He felt ashamed, not only because he had lied and concealed the truth but also due to Wei Baoguo's attitude.</p><p>"Did Wei Baoguo not agree? He thought I was exaggerating, didn't he?"</p><p>Li Yong fell silent.</p><p>What Zhu Tiandlei said was correct; Wei Baoguo did indeed think that Zhu Tiandlei was overstating the case.</p><p>"What a Wei Baoguo!"</p><p>Zhu Tiandlei's face darkened.</p><p>There was personal animosity between Wei Baoguo and him, and even if Wei Baoguo wanted to take revenge for his own sake or anything else, Zhu Tiandlei did not care. However, at this moment, lives were at stake, and it might very well be a large-scale outbreak of an infectious disease. Wei Baoguo simply ignored the situation, and such a person was someone Zhu Tiandlei despised.</p><p>"Mayor Yang, I am Zhu Tiandlei......"</p><p>Zhu Tiandlei called Mayor Yang Wenjie's phone.</p><p>An hour later, Yang Wenjie appeared at the city hospital.</p><p>Fifteen minutes after that, Ren Congzhou, the director of Yundai City Health Bureau, hastily got out of his car and quickly arrived at the president's office.</p><p>Wei Baoguo sat on a chair, looking at Mayor Yang Wenjie who had entered in silence since he walked in. It seemed like there was a fire ant on his buttocks; he wanted to ask something but dared not open his mouth.</p><p>"Mayor Yang, I am here!"</p><p>Ren Congzhou, around fifty years old, had very poor health due to frequent irregular meals and too many social gatherings. However, when Mayor Yang ordered him to immediately come to the city hospital over the phone, he did not waste a minute, even skipping the elevator and climbing thirteen floors of stairs in one go, now drenched in sweat and panting heavily.</p><p>"Director Ren."</p><p>Seeing Ren Congzhou come in, Wei Baoguo's heart couldn't help but skip a beat.</p><p>"Old Wei, what have you done?"</p><p>Ren Congzhou and Wei Baoguo graduated from the same university, though not in the same year. They were still friendly as alumni.</p><p>"I...... I don't know either......"</p><p>Seeing Ren Congzhou come in, Wei Baoguo's heart lightened somewhat.</p><p>He was also very wronged; Mayor Yang had been frowning since he arrived and didn't react to anything he said.</p><p>"Mayor Yang, what mistake has President Wei made? Tell me, and I will surely punish him severely!"</p><p>Ren Congzhou was slightly afraid of Yang Wenjie. Although Yang Wenjie was younger than him, he was very decisive in his actions. In just a few years, he had managed the leadership team of Yunhai City 'properly,' and Ren Congzhou was no exception.</p><p>"Hmph, what mistake? This is the excellent president you nurtured yourself, arrogant, stubborn, and doesn't value human life!"</p><p>The moment Yang Wenjie finished speaking, Wei Baoguo jumped to his feet in fright.</p><p>Although Wei Baoguo was afraid, he knew that Yang Wenjie was a fair person who always handled official matters impartially and could listen to others' opinions, so he dared to defend himself.</p><p>"Yes, Mayor Yang, President Wei has worked diligently these years, and the city hospital's evaluation indicators are all top-notch. Look...... is there perhaps some misunderstanding?"</p><p>Ren Congzhou hurriedly spoke on Wei Baoguo's behalf.</p><p>"Misunderstanding? Ask him if he was aware but didn't report it. Do you know how dangerous the spread of an epidemic can be? Don't you remember that nns incident?"</p><p>Wei Baoguo opened his eyes wide. How did Yang Wenjie know about this?</p><p>"Mayor, what kind of infectious disease is it?"</p><p>Ren Congzhou was taken aback. Yang Wenjie clearly came prepared; could it be that Wei Baoguo had done something behind his back that couldn't be seen by others?</p><p>"Hmph, let him explain himself!"</p><p>Yang Wenjie snorted coldly. He had heard Zhu Tianlei mention the infectious disease case; although it was a suspected case, the probability was over 95%. He knew of Zhu Tianlei's medical skills and trusted his integrity.</p><p>He had given Zhu Tianlei his phone number several months ago. Zhu Tianlei had experienced many things, but the young man never called him before today. Today, he made the call to treat a patient, which made Yang Wenjie admire him even more.</p><p>"I... Mayor Yang, Director Ren, the city hospital admitted three emergency patients with similar symptoms, but that doesn't necessarily mean they have an infectious disease; it could just be a coincidence, not impossible..."</p><p>"Coincidence? As the director of a hospital and a doctor, shouldn't you have already mentioned this? I think your tenure as director is coming to an end!"</p><p>Yang Wenjie abruptly stood up, his gaze icy cold. When someone in a high position gets angry, their aura can be terrifying.</p><p>"Old Wei, what exactly happened? Is it really an infectious disease?"</p><p>Ren Congzhou had risen through the ranks from being a regular doctor and understood the severity of this situation. If it was indeed an infectious disease, Wei Baoguo would face serious consequences.</p><p>"It's not confirmed yet; we're just suspicious..."</p><p>Wei Baoguo still didn't understand who leaked the information to Yang Wenjie. There shouldn't be anyone in their hospital connected to him!</p><p>"Wei Baoguo, from now on, you are suspended without pay. Go, bring Vice Director Tang here!"</p><p>Ren Congzhou knew that Yang Wenjie was genuinely angry and didn't dare to delay. At this moment, supporting Wei Baoguo would only bring trouble.</p><p>Tang Wen was summoned by Ren Congzhou to the director's office.</p>

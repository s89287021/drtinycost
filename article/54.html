						<p>"Bang bang bang!"</p><p>The sound suddenly became urgent but seemed fainter than before.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei lifted his foot and slowly approached the pool of blood, which looked fresh under the moonlight, exuding a mesmerizingly eerie beauty.</p><p>Perhaps...</p><p>Zhu Tianlei squatted down. Beneath the massive production line, a pair of dark eyes filled with fear and despair met Zhu Tianlei's gaze.</p><p>It was a teenager, about seventeen or eighteen years old, with gentle and well-mannered features. His hair was wet and stuck to his head; blood was glaring on his forehead, and his mouth was wrapped in bandages.</p><p>"Did you send me the text message?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei bent down, intending to crawl under the machinery to pull the teenager out, but the boy suddenly shook his head wildly.</p><p>"Are you one of Gu Laohuo's people?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned around and saw a middle-aged man in his forties standing under the moonlight.</p><p>He was bald, with a scar running from his forehead down to his mouth, giving him a sinister look as he grinned maliciously.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>"I am who I am? Hahaha, what a great question. But since you're one of Gu Laohuo's people, it's perfect; I won't have to make another trip. Tell Gu Laohuo to gather three million within twenty-four hours, or his precious grandson's life is no longer my responsibility!"</p><p>Lu Kang folded his arms and looked down condescendingly.</p><p>"Why should I pass on your message? What do you have in return for me?"</p><p>Lu Kang did not expect the young man before him to have no fear of him at all and even dared to talk to him like this. Was he fearless or just stupid?</p><p>"Boy, do you know who you are talking to?"</p><p>Lu Kang's voice involuntarily rose. Today's youth were truly bold and arrogant, ignorant of their place in the world. When Lu Kang was making his way on the streets, this little brat was still inside his mother's womb!</p><p>"I only know that I won't pass along your message, and furthermore, I'm going to take him away!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke calmly but with determination.</p><p>"Haha, strange things happen every year, and this year is particularly abundant. Boy, do you know what you're saying?"</p><p>"I'm not a fool; of course, I know what I'm saying."</p><p>Lu Kang found it hilarious, like how a lion king ruling over the grassland would find it amusing to be threatened by a rabbit it had stepped on, with the rabbit claiming it would eat the lion if it didn't let go.</p><p>"Very well, boy, you want to take this little brat away, do you? Go ahead and try. If you can get this kid out of here, I, Lu Kang, will kneel down for you!"</p><p>"Do you mean what you say?"</p><p>"One word is as binding as a contract, I, Lu Kang, keep my promises!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded and said nothing more, diving back under the machinery to untie the ropes on the teenager's body and also pull off the tape covering his mouth.</p><p>"Come out, it's over now!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled faintly.</p><p>This boy was very smart; clever children are always endearing.</p><p>"Brother, go away, you are no match for him at all!"</p><p>Ge Yang was not Lu Kang; of course, he knew that Zhu Tianlei was never a man under his grandfather's command. It was merely that in his panic, he had entered a random phone number.</p><p>However, he hadn't expected the other party to actually come, which was completely beyond his expectations.</p><p>But now, he suddenly regretted it. The person who could come to save him must be a righteous and upright man. Lu Kang was very capable but also ruthless, and he didn't want to watch this kind-hearted person who came to his rescue get into trouble right before his eyes.</p><p>"Kid, do you not believe me or yourself?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's tone remained as calm as ever, but it now carried a hint of mockery. Ge Yang's face turned slightly red.</p><p>Yes, at this point, it was unlikely that Zhu Tianlei could leave!</p><p>"Come on, come out first and then we'll talk!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei reached out his hand to pull Ge Yang from beneath the machinery. Once Ge Yang stood up, Zhu Tianlei noticed that the boy was very short and weak-looking, but his eyes were unusually bright.</p><p>"Are you ready?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Lu Kang and asked with a smile.</p><p>Lu Kang's gaze shifted. This brat was truly arrogant; today, he would make this brat understand what it meant to have people beyond people.</p><p>"Haha, don't cry out for mercy from Grandpa me later!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei fell silent, holding the boy's slender and flexible hand as his body suddenly leaned forward. Lu Kang extended his hand not at Zhu Tianlei but at Ge Yang who was beside him.</p><p>The corner of Zhu Tianlei's mouth curled up slightly as he reached out with one hand and slapped Lu Kang on the wrist. Lu Kang winced in pain but did not stop; instead, he quickened his approach.</p><p>"Kid, your big brother is sending you out!"</p><p>Before Ge Yang could react, Zhu Tianlei suddenly spun around. Dodging Lu Kang's attack, he tripped Lu Kang's ankle with one foot and then forcefully pulled Ge Yang in the opposite direction. Pushing him lightly, Ge Yang lost his balance and stumbled a few steps before reaching the factory gate.</p><p>"You......"</p><p>Lu Kang was taken aback as Zhu Tianlei's actions were too swift. He hadn't even managed to comprehend Zhu Tianlei's moves when the latter had already sent Ge Yang out.</p><p>"I'm going too!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, and a small lock hold grabbed Lu Kang's shoulder. Then he retracted his foot. Lu Kang attempted to use the same tactic on Zhu Tianlei, stretching out his leg to stop him. However, it seemed that Zhu Tianlei had been prepared for this move. Before Lu Kang could touch his ankle, Zhu Tianlei executed a reverse golden hook kick, leaping into the air and wrapping both feet around a nearby mechanical crossbar. With both hands exerting force, Lu Kang felt half of his body go numb.</p><p>In just over ten seconds, when Lu Kang turned back to look, Zhu Tianlei was already securely standing beside Ge Yang.</p><p>Ge Yang's mouth hung open in utter shock.</p><p>He had watched his grandfather's men perform martial arts since he was young; they were all skilled in both punches and kicks. However, compared to this younger brother, none of them could hold a candle to him.</p><p>Lu Kang's expression became even uglier.</p><p>Having mixed for thirty years, from an apprentice little brother to the second-in-command of a gang, he had never encountered such a formidable opponent before.</p><p>Lu Kang clenched his fists in hatred, feeling both unwilling and humiliated. He moved his foot, ready to attack.</p><p>"No need to kneel; I, Zhu Tianlei, don't fear shortening my life—I'll take this person away!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei saw Ge Yang's mouth agape, staring at him like a monster, which he found amusing.</p><p>"Alright, let's go!"</p><p>Ge Yang turned around dazedly and was dragged forward by Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Want to leave?"</p><p>Behind them, Lu Kang's voice was low and sinister.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned around and saw Lu Kang staring at him, a black pistol in his hand, the barrel gleaming ominously with a hint of death.</p><p>Ge Yang's face instantly paled.</p><p>"This is the first time I've seen a real gun, but this one seems to be of rather poor quality."</p><p>Unlike Ge Yang, Zhu Tianlei spoke with an unusually calm tone, even bordering on casual.</p>

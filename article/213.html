						<p>Zhu Tianlei gave the man a cold glance before opening the car door and getting out.</p><p>"Asshole, pay up!"</p><p>Actually, the man wasn't ugly at all; on the contrary, his fair complexion and striking features were quite appealing. However, a person spouting foul language was repulsive to look at.</p><p>"Pay up?"</p><p>"You fucking crashed my car, do you think it's free of charge?"</p><p>Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, the man's eyes immediately widened in anger.</p><p>"Is this parking spot yours?"</p><p>"Spare me your bullshit and pay up quickly. Fifty thousand yuan, or I'll make sure you regret it."</p><p>The man never spoke without cursing; he always used foul language whenever he opened his mouth.</p><p>"Fifty thousand yuan? Are you sure about that?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the scratches on the Porsche. Due to his quick reaction and the thick layer of vinyl advertising for a company stuck on the back of the van, the damage to the Porsche wasn't too severe.</p><p>"You fucking poor guy, do you know what kind of car this is? A Porsche. You can't even trade twenty or thirty of those old vans for one like mine. Fifty thousand yuan from you is the least I could do."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but laugh.</p><p>"What are you laughing at?"</p><p>The man was in the middle of his act and became furious upon seeing Zhu Tianlei's laughter.</p><p>"I didn't know your car was so expensive. As you can see, I'm just driving an old van; there's no way I could have that much money on me. How about you wait here for a while while I go find a friend to help out?"</p><p>"Impossible, you're dreaming. If you leave, can you come back?"</p><p>"What if I left my van here as collateral...?"</p><p>"Eww, with that old van, it's only good enough to sell to a scrap collector. Stop wasting time and call someone to send you money."</p><p>The man looked at Zhu Tianlei disdainfully and said impatiently.</p><p>"Sir, to be honest, we are from the countryside. My parents are farmers who don't even know how to use a phone. Even if I call them, they wouldn't have any money. It would be better if you took me to the bank yourself!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei lowered his posture, looking extremely frightened and fearful of the man.</p><p>"Alright then, since your attitude is good, I'll take you this one time."</p><p>Thinking about getting 50,000 yuan without doing anything that morning, the man was in a good mood.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei got into his car nervously. Before the man could sit in the passenger seat, Zhu Tianlei got out with a miserable look on his face.</p><p>"Sir, my car is pretty old and won't start. How about we take your car instead?"</p><p>"Hmph, an old car is no good, trash. Fine, today I'll let you experience what it's like to drive a nice car."</p><p>The man walked directly to his Porsche, which started up immediately. As the car pulled out of the parking space, Zhu Tianlei sneered and got back into the van.</p><p>"Hey, get in the car... damn it!"</p><p>As the man was lowering the window to let Zhu Tianlei in, he saw Zhu Tianlei climb back into his van. In a flash, the van started up and charged towards the Porsche.</p><p>The man's eyes blazed with anger, but he did not obstruct Zhu Tianlei's actions. The van, like a ship revved up to full power, hit the Porsche harder each time.</p><p>No car could withstand such close-range collisions. The front of the Porsche was completely ruined, the windshield shattered, and the side mirrors fell off. Essentially, the Porsche had become half a wreck at that point.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned off the engine and walked out, half of his body leaning against the side of the van. He coldly watched as the man, frustrated and enraged, squeezed himself out of the deformed car door.</p><p>"Dog bastard, you're asking for death!"</p><p>The moment he got out of the car, the man lunged at Zhu Tianlei, directly aiming for his head.</p><p>But just as his hand was about to touch Zhu Tianlei's forehead, it was grabbed by someone. He struggled but couldn't break free; before he could reach again with his other hand, it too was seized.</p><p>"F*ck off, let me go, I'll kill you."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression gradually darkened, a stark contrast to the cowardly person he had appeared as earlier.</p><p>"What I hate most are people like you who are arrogant and domineering. You want money, don't you? Take it!"</p><p>Trapped by Zhu Tianlei's grip on his wrists, the man was so furious that his eyeballs nearly popped out.</p><p>"F*ck off, do you know who I am?"</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>"I...... if you have guts, let go of me, and I'll show you who I am."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei obediently released his hands, but the man couldn't hold himself up and fell to the ground with a thud, landing hard on his buttocks.</p><p>"Alright, alright, I'll let you see......"</p><p>The man pointed at Zhu Tianlei and quickly pulled out his phone from his pocket.</p><p>"Hey, Sister Hong, my car was smashed, and I got beaten up. Come quick, if you're not here soon, they'll kill me......"</p><p>The man sobbed into the phone, looking nothing like a tough guy but more like a spoiled child of five or six years old. However, after hanging up, the ferocious expression returned to his face.</p><p>"The little dog paralyzed, wait a minute and kneel down to lick my feet for me."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the man coldly without saying anything. Since the incident had not yet occurred, he was curious to see just who this Sister Hong was; did she dare to cause trouble outside the police station?</p><p>Ten minutes later, a middle-aged woman rushed over from the other side of the road, followed by four or five men, all relatively young and with an aggressive demeanor.</p><p>"Sister Hong, sis, my brother is about to be beaten to death, and there's also my car. Did you see it... Sister Hong, you have to help your brother take revenge..."</p><p>Upon seeing the middle-aged woman, the man immediately pounced on her, his actions seeming awkward.</p><p>The middle-aged woman reached out, patting the man's shoulder and even pinching his face, looking like a mother with her son.</p><p>After calming down the man, the middle-aged woman raised her head to look at Zhu Tianlei. Her slightly swollen face, due to her obese figure, had eyes that exuded an inappropriate seductiveness for her age.</p><p>"Was it you who beat Xiao Peng?"</p><p>Her plump body and middle-aged appearance were contrasted by a voice so sweet that it made Zhu Tianlei shudder.</p><p>"Sis, could you please speak nicely? It's really scary."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was not exaggerating; he truly felt as though his hair stood on end.</p><p>"What does the little brat have to say? Is Sister Hong someone you can talk to like that?"</p><p>It seemed that the middle-aged woman's arrival had emboldened the man.</p><p>"Haha, Xiao Peng, let him speak. I find it quite interesting."</p><p>The middle-aged woman laughed instead of getting angry, but her face, heavily powdered and with bright red lips, was revolting to look at.</p><p>"Sister Hong..."</p><p>The man stretched out his moan for a long time, as if he were... being spoiled.</p><p>"Alright, alright, Sister Hong knows you're suffering."</p>

						<p>A small, dark-skinned law enforcement officer walked out from the raw material warehouse, holding a gray object in his hand.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, do you recognize this?"</p><p>Mu Kun remained expressionless as he pointed to the object held by his subordinate and asked.</p><p>"Of course I do. It's opium poppy shells; I bet everyone here recognizes it."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei maintained his composure, speaking casually and calmly.</p><p>However, a trace of cruelty flickered in Mu Kun's eyes.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you should know that opium is a prohibited drug and cannot be used as an additive or auxiliary ingredient in food or medicine. On this point alone, Tienlei Pharmaceutical should be ordered to cease production."</p><p>Since the discovery of the opium poppy shells, the surrounding dealers had been whispering among themselves. After hearing Mu Kun's words, their murmurs grew louder.</p><p>"Inspector Mu, we discovered a drug containing prohibited substances in the inventory."</p><p>Another staff member walked out from the warehouse, holding a stack of medicine boxes, about seventeen or eighteen in total.</p><p>This discovery was like a boulder thrown into a lake, instantly causing a tumultuous wave.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, as the corporate legal representative, how do you explain this?"</p><p>Mu Kun glanced at Zhu Tianlei and was pleased with the expression on his face. Hmph, did he really think that his rise to power in his youth gave him license to look down on everyone?</p><p>"What kind of explanation does Inspector Mu want?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not answer Mu Kun but instead retorted with a question.</p><p>"Seize the raw material warehouse and the warehouse, order the company to cease production for rectification. Recall all products currently available on the market. Production or sales must not resume until the investigation is complete. Remediation and compensation for any harm caused must be carried out according to relevant regulations."</p><p>Mu Kun said clearly and understandably, so even a fool could understand. Among the hundred or so distributors present, more than half had already given up on cooperating with Tianlei Pharmaceutical, while those who had signed cooperation agreements were deeply regretful.</p><p>"Making medicine is like being a person; one must have integrity. The motto of my Tianlei Pharmaceutical is that we can earn less money, but we cannot lose the integrity in making medicine. Moreover, some things are not what they seem. If you trust me, Zhu Tianlei, I guarantee that Tianlei Pharmaceutical will give everyone a bright future. If you do not think Tianlei Pharmaceutical is trustworthy, including those who signed cooperation agreements earlier, you can contact our staff to apply for the invalidation of the agreement. Not only will I, Zhu Tianlei, not demand any compensation, but I will also reimburse all expenses incurred by participants as promised."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words were heartfelt yet sharp like a knife.</p><p>Upon finishing his statement, the crowd erupted once more.</p><p>"Those who have made their decision can go out now to process the cancellation of agreements. However, from now on, any medicine produced by my Tianlei Pharmaceutical will no longer be associated with you in any way."</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei did not look at anyone's reactions. As they say, blood relations are thicker than water, and it is the same for business; if one cannot trust his enterprise or withstand even a slight blow or test, such partners were not what Zhu Tianlei desired.</p><p>Soon, most of the crowd dispersed, leaving fewer than twenty people behind.</p><p>Mu Kun looked at Zhu Tianlei with an icy smile, thinking that he was still young and acted impulsively without considering consequences. Did he really think he was in a gathering hall like Liangshan heroes? In this society, who cared about integrity, especially businessmen who only cared for one thing: money, or more precisely, profit.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, we will now seal the warehouse and pharmacy according to regulations. Please cooperate."</p><p>"Cooperation is naturally guaranteed, but I have a question. Would it be possible to consult with Chief Mu?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's attitude remained calm and composed, though in Mu Kun's eyes, it appeared forced. Now that evidence was undeniable, Tianlei Pharmaceutical was like Sun Wukong in the palm of the Buddha's hand; no matter what, they could not escape their fate of being suppressed.</p><p>"You may ask."</p><p>At this point, Mu Kun did not mind making Zhu Tianlei's end clearer.</p><p>"I would like to ask Chief Mu, did you already know that Tianlei Pharmaceutical had prohibited substances such as opium? Did you know which batch of products contained opium?"</p><p>The moment Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, the crowd stirred again. The question seemed simple but revealed a deeper issue upon reflection.</p><p>Mu Kun was taken aback; he had not expected Zhu Tianlei to ask such a question.</p><p>"Of course not."</p><p>Mu Kun denied it without a second thought. What joke was this? Would he admit to such a thing?</p><p>"Since that's the case, I'll invite everyone to take a tour of Tianlei Pharmaceutical's warehouse and raw material storage!"</p><p>Mu Kun was taken aback again. What did Zhu Tianlei mean by this—was he stalling for time?</p><p>However, he had thoroughly reviewed every detail, leaving no trace behind. Mu Kun, as the former chief of the Security Inspection Department for thirteen years, was not one to be fooled; he had dealt with countless small-time thugs and knew all their tricks.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not say a word more, and together with Mao Yu who arrived shortly after, they fully opened the warehouse door that had previously been slightly ajar. Inside were cardboard boxes stacked up one on top of another, reaching a height of more than a person, totaling around one hundred twenty.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stepped inside and looked at Mu Kun with a faint smile.</p><p>With a rustling sound, he swept the cardboard box next to him to the ground. As the box fell, its contents spilled out—a pile of scrap paper.</p><p>Following the same method, Zhu Tianlei kicked over all the remaining cardboard boxes, revealing that each one contained nothing but scrap paper.</p><p>At this sight, everyone was stunned and gaping open-mouthed, with Mu Kun being the most surprised of all.</p><p>"This......"</p><p>What was going on? Why was the warehouse empty?</p><p>"Chief Mu, due to issues with the factory's equipment, we have been shut down for the past three days. All our inventory has already been sent to distributors. These cardboard boxes are all empty. I want to know where this person found their medication?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei raised his eyebrows slightly, glancing at the person still holding the medicine box with a smile that was neither fully approving nor disapproving.</p><p>"Or perhaps Chief Mu thinks I deliberately placed these problematic medications in a prominent location, waiting for Chief Mu to inspect them?"</p><p>Mu Kun's face turned as dark as the bottom of a pot.</p><p>"And besides, seeing Director Mu and this comrade's shocked expressions, could it be that after a thorough search, they actually found all these boxes to be empty?"</p><p>The law enforcement officer holding the medicine box had sweat beads pouring down his forehead.</p><p>"Or perhaps Director Mu and this comrade already knew where these drugs containing prohibited substances were located beforehand?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei fired off three consecutive questions, thoroughly turning Mu Kun's face a dark shade.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, what do you mean by this? Are you suspecting me of framing you? I, Mu Kun, have only met you once; what reason could I possibly have to frame you?"</p><p>"Don't get angry, Director Mu. I didn't intend to accuse you at all. I was just expressing my doubts and seeking your guidance."</p><p>Compared to Mu Kun's rage, Zhu Tianlei remained calm as a cucumber, a description fitting his composure.</p><p>Everyone present was no fool; they had already grasped the gist of what happened, though no one had explicitly pointed it out yet.</p>

						<p>Hao Xinmei was holding a half-grown puppy in her arms, with its gray fluffy fur nestled comfortably against her. The pup looked lifeless.</p><p>"Th... This is your son?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei asked in shock.</p><p>Is this woman crazy? Taking a dog as her son out of the blue.</p><p>"Yes, he's called Hua Rong. He's been by my side for five years and we've lived together. Usually, he's full of energy, but about a month ago, he suddenly fell ill. He hasn't eaten or drunk anything for three days now... I'm afraid he might die!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei looked at the puppy called Hua Rong in her arms, tears welling up in her phoenix eyes.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face contorted with confusion. He wondered how Xiao Li Guang Hua Rong would feel if he knew his name was being used by a dog.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, please save Hua Rong! He's my only family member in this world!"</p><p>Seeing the Ice Queen Hao Xinmei crying, her delicate appearance tugging at his heartstrings, Zhu Tianlei's playful mood dissipated immediately.</p><p>"Well... don't cry. Let me see what's wrong with him."</p><p>In truth, Zhu Tianlei was also uncertain. The Spirit Doctor had profound medical skills and a thorough understanding of pharmacology and medicine, but he couldn't recall any information about treating animals.</p><p>Well, if he can't cure it, he won't harm it either?</p><p>What if he stumbles upon the right treatment by chance!</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, Hao Xinmei immediately stopped crying and carefully placed Hua Rong in Zhu Tianlei's hands.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned. He had never particularly liked these furry creatures since childhood, but fortunately, this Hua Rong was very obedient, or rather, very weak. In Zhu Tianlei's hands, he lay as still as a rag doll.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hesitated for a moment and then placed his hand on Hua Rong's belly.</p><p>Refusing to eat, eight or nine times out of ten, it is due to an issue with the internal organs.</p><p>Sure enough, as soon as Zhu Tianlei's hand touched Hua Rong's abdomen, he felt a coldness spreading from his fingers. This coldness was the disease, and using spiritual energy to locate the source of illness was one of the most miraculous diagnostic methods in spirit medicine apart from pulse diagnosis.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei focused and calmed his mind, slowly rubbing along Hua Rong's abdomen inwardly. A hard object, resembling a stone, appeared in Hua Rong's stomach.</p><p>"How is it? Can it be treated?"</p><p>Hao Xinmei looked at Zhu Tianlei with an extremely cautious expression, as if she was afraid of hearing any bad news.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt somewhat bitter. In this person's eyes, he was clearly not even as good as a dog. Those who had previously been bragging and shouting at him now gave ample affection to this dog, full of 'soft and tender love.'</p><p>"It should be treatable, but I need to prepare some medicine first, and also... "</p><p>"And what?"</p><p>"If my diagnosis is correct, Hua Rong has something growing in its stomach. It seems that Hua Rong may have contracted fur ball disease, which is why it can't eat anything. This illness is quite complicated to treat!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Hao Xinmei's slender and graceful legs and suddenly had a rather 'lustful' idea.</p><p>"How much money do you need? Just say it!"</p><p>"You women talk about nothing but money all the time. If money could cure it, would you have come to look for me in Toad Ditch out of your own free will?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was indeed somewhat angry. This woman had repeatedly trampled on his dignity as a man, truly believing that money could work miracles!</p><p>Hao Xinmei did not expect Zhu Tianlei to suddenly turn on her. She had just casually asked a question; didn't treating an illness require payment?</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, did I say anything wrong?"</p><p>"You...... Forget it, curing her will take about three days. You can leave Hua Rong here with me and come to pick her up after three days. If you're not comfortable with that, feel free to do as you please!"</p><p>"I...... I'll stay with Hua Rong!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei hesitated for a moment but finally made up her mind to stay with Hua Rong.</p><p>"Whatever you want!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei muttered something and then went into the house.</p><p>He quickly moved to the door, peering through the crack to see Hao Xinmei's stunning face. Zhu Tianlei's lips slowly curled upwards, and his eyes squinted in a smile.</p><p>"Haha, three days, so many things can happen in three days!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei excitedly made a 'yes' gesture at the door.</p><p>"Tianlei, what are you doing?"</p><p>Haoxinlei was startled by her father's voice and awkwardly pulled back his hand.</p><p>"Cough cough, nothing much. It's hot outside, I just wanted to cool down behind the door!"</p><p>Zhu Tuanzi glanced at his son and then looked outside at the gloomy weather. The wind rustled the apricot tree leaves in the courtyard.</p><p>Hot?</p><p>When he turned his gaze back to Hao Xinmei standing in the courtyard, Zhu Tuanzi's heart instantly sank. Could it be that his son had fallen for her?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was still lost in his excited daydreaming and didn't notice his father's thoughts.</p><p>Hou Suqin returned quickly. As soon as she entered, before even putting down the basket of vegetables, she was urgently pulled into the house by her husband. After a brief exchange, she walked out to call Hao Xinmei to the courtyard.</p><p>"Are you a girl from the city?"</p><p>"Auntie, I come from Yunhai City."</p><p>Hao Xinhui held Hua Rong and said calmly to Hou Suqin, who was clearly looking her up and down.</p><p>"Oh, I just heard from Leizi's father that you came to see Leizi for a check-up?"</p><p>"Yes, it's for my son!"</p><p>Hao Xinhui naturally pointed to Hua Rong in her arms, which made Hou Suqin's expression change dramatically, becoming quite strange.</p><p>"Oh oh, girl, here's the thing: our rural areas are different from cities. There are many housewives who love to gossip. My son Leizi isn't married yet. If something bad is spread around, it might make it hard for him to find a wife in the future. You see..."</p><p>Hao Xinhui's face immediately turned red. Anyone with common sense could understand what Hou Suqin was hinting at—she was essentially telling Hao Xinhui to leave!</p><p>Though Zhu Tianlei wasn't married, Hao Xinhui was still an innocent young maiden. She hadn't said anything yet, and this is what the other woman said.</p><p>Seeing the tears welling up in Hao Xinhui's eyes, Hou Suqin felt a bit of remorse, but thinking that if she didn't stop her son's thoughts quickly, it might become even more troublesome later on, she decided to be the "bad guy."</p><p>"Auntie, you can rest assured. I'll stay in my car and won't affect Doctor Zhu's reputation at all. As soon as Hua Rong is better, I'll leave!"</p><p>Hao Xinhui gritted her teeth. For Hua Rong, she was willing to endure this!</p><p>This...</p><p>Hou Suqin had already felt quite sorry for Hao Xinhui, but now that the other woman had said this, it would be a bit too much if she insisted on more.</p><p>Alright then!</p><p>As long as they didn't live in the same courtyard!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was stirring up medicine in the room; the furball disease he had learned about from TV. Before this, he wouldn't have been able to treat it, but as soon as he returned home, a method for treating the condition came to mind. Although it was a treatment for humans, it bore some similarity to curing an animal's furball disease. Most importantly, the method was very simple.</p><p>Because he was focused on mixing the medicine, he was unaware of everything happening outside the house and had no idea that Hao Xinmei had already been keeping score of his debts in her mind.</p><p>Two hours later, Zhu Tianlei wiped the sweat from his forehead, looked at the ball-shaped pills scattered on the counter, grinned, and then realized he was still wearing his clothes covered in mud.</p><p>He changed into clean clothes, picked up the pills, and walked out of the house with a triumphant look on his face.</p><p>"Eh? Where is everyone?"</p>

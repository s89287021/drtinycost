						<p>A middle-aged woman pinched the man's face again and then turned her head to look at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Little brother, Xiao Peng is my person. You offended him, which means you don't take me seriously. Now, tell me how you plan to resolve this matter."</p><p>"What great ideas do you have, Big Sister? Share them with us."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shrugged his shoulders and asked sarcastically.</p><p>"Xiao Peng, what do you say?"</p><p>"Hmph, I want him to kneel down, lick my toes clean, and kowtow to me until I'm satisfied."</p><p>"Xiao Peng really has some creativity, hahaha..."</p><p>The middle-aged woman let out a series of eerie laughs in the middle of the night.</p><p>"You brat, did you hear that? Kneel down and kowtow to Xiao Peng. If you do that, Big Sister Hong will forgive you."</p><p>"Hahahaha, Big Sister Hong, don't you think you should consider your own position before saying something like that?"</p><p>"Oh? Consider my position? Haha, little brother, you're really adorable. Do I need to consider my words, Big Sister Bao Hong?"</p><p>Big Sister Hong seemed to have heard something funny, and the two mounds on her chest heaved with laughter.</p><p>"Alright alright, little brother, stop messing around and kowtow quickly. I still have things to do."</p><p>"Does Big Sister Hong think I'm joking? Fine then, if Big Sister Hong thinks she can make me kneel down, go ahead. Of course, before that, Big Sister Hong should consider the consequences."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei kept shrugging his shoulders and smiling mischievously, but Bao Hong's heart sank suddenly.</p><p>"Big Sister Hong, stop wasting time with him. This brat is very vicious; look at how he pinched my wrist..."</p><p>A man reached out, waving his wrist in front of Hong's eyes. Baohong's face finally turned serious.</p><p>"Last chance, will you kneel or not?"</p><p>"No matter how many times you ask, Hong, my answer remains the same: if you have what it takes, come on."</p><p>Such arrogance!</p><p>Baohong raised her hand, and several men behind her moved forward, looking like they were enforcers of some sort.</p><p>"Get at him! Remember, don't ruin your looks; Hong values this face a lot!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spat inwardly before turning to look at the group rushing towards him.</p><p>Not bad, they seem to have some training.</p><p>"Just what I needed to loosen up."</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei spoke, Baohong broke into laughter.</p><p>The enforcers she employed were sourced from various channels and possessed top-notch skills throughout the Cloud Sea City. After all, not everyone could afford a monthly wage of twenty thousand yuan.</p><p>A shadow of cruelty flashed across the eyes of the man standing beside Hong.</p><p>"Don't worry, Xiao Peng, Hong will definitely make them pay for this."</p><p>After speaking, she casually patted the man's pocket.</p><p>However, before her hand completely left his pocket, Zhu Tianlei had already knocked down her enforcers with three punches and two kicks.</p><p>When he looked at Zhu Tianlei again, he was still leaning against the car door, smirking at Baohong.</p><p>"The muscles hadn't warmed up yet, and the people brought by Miss Hong were truly subpar."</p><p>Bao Hong was first shocked, then furiously enraged.</p><p>"A bunch of good-for-nothings, can't even take on a little kid. What am I feeding you for?"</p><p>It's no wonder Bao Hong was angry; the cost of maintaining these bouncers accounted for 1/4 of her nightclub's expenses, which was not an insignificant amount.</p><p>But now, these bouncers who had been hired for hundreds of thousands of yuan were being knocked down without even landing a single blow against the opponents. Anyone would find this hard to swallow.</p><p>The bouncers, reprimanded by Miss Hong, felt ashamed and glanced at each other before rising together and lunging at Zhu Tianlei once more.</p><p>Their salaries in Yunhai City could be considered high-end income, much higher than that of ordinary corporate white-collar workers. Besides, this industry thrived on youth; they had to seize their prime years to earn enough for retirement, and Bao Hong's nightclub was their best choice.</p><p>Facing the bouncers who lunged at him again, Zhu Tianlei did not even move his hands; he simply lifted off the ground by balancing on one toe, spinning around, and swiftly kicked several people in succession.</p><p>A gust of wind swept through, scattering leaves.</p><p>In an instant, these individuals were once more knocked to the ground.</p><p>"Brat, you've got some talent."</p><p>Although Bao Hong was angry, she still genuinely admired Zhu Tianlei's abilities from the bottom of her heart.</p><p>"But you attacked my men today. If I don't let this slide, they'll probably make me a laughingstock in the industry."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei tugged at his lips; what nonsense logic was this.</p><p>"Miss Hong, I think it would be best if you asked your little lapdog who is overstepping their bounds—me or him using his position for leverage?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Bao Hong, sensing her aura of martial arts prowess. Usually, women like her were not narrow-minded; by clarifying things upfront, he hoped to avoid unnecessary complications. If she was reasonable, he wouldn't want to prolong the matter; if she insisted, Zhu Tianlei wasn't afraid.</p><p>"Xiaopeng, what did he mean by that?"</p><p>Sure enough, upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, Bao Hong's gaze shifted to Xiaopeng.</p><p>"Hong Sister, don't listen to this little brat. Nobody knows who I am except you, Hong Sister, right? I always avoid even my neighbors' pet dogs. How could I deliberately provoke him as he said?"</p><p>Xiaopeng was truly a talent. Since Bao Hong's appearance, this boy had stopped lying and his arrogant and shameless demeanor had been completely subdued, turning into a lovable lapdog that only enjoyed being petted by its owner.</p><p>"Are you telling the truth?"</p><p>"Hong Sister, would you believe me instead of this brat?"</p><p>Seeing Xiaopeng's face fall, eyes full of tears like Lin Daiyu's, Zhu Tianlei felt goosebumps all over.</p><p>"You really missed out on an Oscar."</p><p>Facing Zhu Tianlei's provocation, Xiaopeng refused to respond, only pitifully looking at Bao Hong.</p><p>"Alright, Hong Sister, I see you've been blinded by this brat's charms. That's all I have to say. Believe it or not is up to you. If you're still unconvinced, feel free to come again. I still have about seven or eight minutes before the police station opens."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at his watch; indeed, according to the time, the police station would open in another seven or eight minutes.</p><p>"Stinky brat, you're capable. How about this? I won't pursue what happened today. Here's my business card. If you're interested, come find me at this place. I'll give you a salary of 50,000 yuan per month."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback and instinctively took the business card from Bao Hong's hand.</p><p>Hua Sheng Nightclub?</p><p>"To be a prostitute?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't mean to ask that, but the words clearly served as another trigger for Xiaopeng's excitement.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the business card in his hand and then at Xiao Peng, who kept cooing and acting cute.</p><p>"Are you a prostitute?"</p><p>Xiao Peng's face turned red with anger at Zhu Tianlei's words. He wanted to say something, but saw Bao Hong frown.</p><p>"Don't talk anymore, come back with me, all of you, get back!"</p><p>Xiao Peng felt bitter resentment in his heart and glared hatefully at Zhu Tianlei, but still followed Bao Hong away.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pursed his lips, unsure whether Xiao Peng's resentful glance was due to him having hit his car or because he feared losing his job to him.</p>

						<p>Yang Dong was taken aback, not expecting the situation to suddenly turn this way. However, looking at Zhu Tianlei's stern face with a hint of confidence, a glimmer of hope rose in his heart.</p><p>"Hmm, what if you can't save her?"</p><p>"I'll risk my life!"</p><p>The three words fell like thunderclaps, causing Ma Lanlan's tense heart to almost shatter into pieces. Did Zhu Tianlei even know what he was saying!</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>"Bureau Director Yang, I just offended you!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't blame Yang Dong; if it were him, his mood wouldn't be much better.</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei squat down beside Yang Xiaoxue again, this time Yang Dong didn't stop him.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei once more placed his hand on Yang Xiaoxue's wrist, the point of contact feeling icy cold.</p><p>He pressed on Yang Xiaoxue's Yangchi acupoint with one hand and traced her waist to the upper part before finally landing on the Lianquan acupoint. Everyone, especially Yang Dong, held their breaths so tightly that they didn't dare blink.</p><p>"Lanlan, do you have silver needles?"</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei infused his spiritual energy into Yang Xiaoxue's acupoints, he asked Ma Lanlan.</p><p>He had forgotten the silver needles at home due to leaving in a hurry.</p><p>"No...... wait, I'll go get them right now!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan seemed to receive an imperial decree and rushed towards the clinic as if every second could cost Zhu Tianlei his life.</p><p>The spiritual energy flowed into Yang Xiaoxue's body like a gentle spring. Although she was still unconscious, she vaguely felt her body becoming warmer, and the pain of nearing death slowly fading away.</p><p>"Tiandei, here it is!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan moved incredibly fast; what usually took seven to eight minutes became just three minutes for her return trip.</p><p>Zhu Tiandei looked at Ma Lanlan gratefully and accepted the silver needle she offered.</p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p>With most of the spiritual energy used up, Zhu Tiandei endured the weakness caused by excessive use of spiritual energy and secretly slipped the purple heart grass pill he had made from crushed material into Yang Xiaoxue's mouth last night. He then inserted the silver needle into her body in a 'seven up, nine down, three shallow one deep' pattern.</p><p>Time ticked by slowly.</p><p>Some were anxious, some were desperate, and others were excited.</p><p>Zhu Tiandei silently gazed at Yang Xiaoxue's face, as beautiful as that of an immortal maiden, counting the time silently in his heart. He believed in himself and trusted that Yang Xiaoxue was a girl with good fortune; someone willing to teach in rural areas would surely be favored by heaven.</p><p>"Humph, such arrogance! A few massages and needle pricks can save her life? What a joke!"</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo was certain that Zhu Tiandei had lost!</p><p>"Ugh!"</p><p>At this moment, Yang Xiaoxue, who had been lying motionless on the ground, suddenly twitched and quickly sat up, vomiting uncontrollably onto the floor. The vomit contained clearly visible fragments of undigested apricot mushrooms.</p><p>"Hurry, give her as much water as possible!"</p><p>Zhu Tiandei felt delighted, while Yang Dong was shocked into inaction for a moment before his eyes filled with tears at the age of fifty-something.</p><p>Upon hearing Zhu Tiandei's words, everyone sprang to action, some fetching buckets of water, others looking for cups, and still others giving her water. Zhu Tiandei, on the other hand, became an idle observer.</p><p>Li Yong stared in disbelief at the scene before him. Having practiced medicine for nearly fifteen years, he had never seen such miraculous medical skills; perhaps he would call it magic. This young man was simply a medical prodigy.</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo looked like an idiot, staring blankly at the bustling crowd. Yang Xiaoxue was alive again. Although she had not fully regained consciousness yet, he knew that it was only a matter of time before she woke up.</p><p>He had lost, and lost thoroughly!</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo suddenly felt he lacked the courage to stay any longer and turned around, fleeing out of the room like a madman.</p><p>"Dad, wuwu, I thought I would never see you again!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue quickly regained consciousness and threw herself into her father's arms, sobbing uncontrollably. She had truly believed she was going to die!</p><p>"Stupid girl, isn't everything okay now? Stop crying or your eyes will get swollen and you won't be pretty anymore!"</p><p>Yang Dong coaxed his precious daughter like he would a child. The joy of getting her back was even more thrilling than riding a roller coaster.</p><p>The more this was the case, the more complicated his gaze became when looking at Zhu Tianlei. Thinking about his previous actions made Yang Dong extremely ashamed and guilty.</p><p>"Xiaoxue, quickly thank your savior; without him, we might never have seen each other again!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue followed her father's finger direction and saw Zhu Tianlei standing in the middle of the room. Sunlight filtered through the window, casting a glow on his figure. For a moment, Yang Xiaoxue felt that Zhu Tianlei resembled the mighty white prince from her dreams.</p><p>She completely forgot about her disdain and coldness towards him from the previous day.</p><p>"Thank you, I don't even know your name!"</p><p>Yang Dong also realized that someone had saved his daughter, yet he didn't even know their name; it was truly inexcusable.</p><p>"He's called Zhu Tianlei. He is our village's miracle doctor."</p><p>After having a brush with 'death', Yao Gang's back was drenched in sweat. Now that the storm had passed, mentioning Zhu Tianlei made him brim with pride from within.</p><p>Li Yong stared in disbelief at the scene before him.

Now that the storm had passed, mentioning Zhu Tianlei made him brim with pride from within.</p><p>Li Yong stared in disbelief at the scene before him.

This young man was truly a medical prodigy.</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo looked like an idiot, staring blankly at the bustling crowd. Yang Xiaoxue was alive again. Although she had not fully regained consciousness yet, he knew that it was only a matter of time before she woke up.</p><p>He had lost, and lost thoroughly!</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo suddenly felt he lacked the courage to stay any longer and turned around, fleeing out of the room like a madman.</p><p>"Dad, wuwu, I thought I would never see you again!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue quickly regained consciousness and threw herself into her father's arms, sobbing uncontrollably.

Stop crying or your eyes will get swollen and you won't be pretty anymore!"</p><p>Yang Dong coaxed his precious daughter like he would a child. The joy of getting her back was even more thrilling than riding a roller coaster.</p><p>The more this was the case, the more complicated his gaze became when looking at Zhu Tianlei.

He is our village's miracle doctor."</p><p>After having a brush with 'death', Yao Gang's back was drenched in sweat. Now that the storm had passed, mentioning Zhu Tianlei made him brim with pride from within.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei not only managed to retain his position as the village chief but also indirectly made Party Secretary Yang owe him a personal favor. Zhu Tianlei was truly like Yao Gang's lucky star, and the fortune of Hama Gou Village!</p><p>In the face of Yang Xiaoxue's gratitude and Yao Gang's praise, Zhu Tianlei remained calm. The more composed he appeared, the better impression Yang Dong formed of him.</p><p>"Tianlei, I apologize for my earlier attitude; don't take it to heart. Look at how skilled you are in medicine; perhaps I could get someone to recommend you for a job at the city hospital!"</p><p>Yang Dong spoke sincerely, partly to make amends for his previous rashness and partly because such talent was wasted in this small mountain village.</p><p>"Yes, little brother, your medical skills are truly remarkable. Party Secretary Yang is right; you should go work at the city hospital. I guarantee you will become an outstanding doctor!"</p><p>Seeing Party Secretary Yang and this doctor in white desperately trying to convince Zhu Tianlei to go to the city hospital, Yao Gang felt a bit uneasy. This lucky star was clearly theirs from Hama Gou Village; why should they have to dig him up for the city!</p><p>But while he could think that way, he couldn't say it aloud. To be fair, he knew very well that working as a doctor in the city would be like climbing to heaven in one step; no fool would refuse such an opportunity!</p>

						<p>Zhu Tianlei chuckled to himself, both were his women, and the thought made him incredibly proud. "Xinmei, this is Ma Lanlan, whom I mentioned to you before." "Lanlan, hello!" Hao Xinmei stretched out her hand, and Ma Lanlan hesitated for a moment before forcing a smile and shaking hands with Hao Xinmei. "I've been hearing Tianlei talk about you non-stop, saying how beautiful and intelligent you are. I finally met you today, and it's true as he said." Ma Lanlan glanced at Zhu Tianlei out of the corner of her eye, seeing him leaning casually with a smug smile on his face, which only made her feel more sour inside. How close were their relationships for him to talk about these things to each other? At least, he hadn't mentioned Hao Xinmei to her before. "He's just lying! You guys chat, I still have something to do, so I'm going out first!" Ma Lanlan chuckled nervously, almost fleeing the scene. "She doesn't seem very happy about it!" After all, as a woman, Hao Xinmei immediately picked up on this, sensing that the other person didn't seem too welcoming towards her. But why? "Don't worry about it, she's just got that kind of personality. Oh right, Xinmei, come take a look!" Zhu Tianlei could guess what Ma Lanlan was thinking, but at the moment, he had more important things to attend to; he would deal with her later. Hao Xinmei didn't ask further questions since Zhu Tianlei had already given her a brief overview over the phone. She took the bottle from Zhu Tianlei's hand and started examining it carefully. "Tianlei, I've never seen these insects before, but I've already contacted Professor Li at the Parasitology Research Institute as well as the Director of the Disease Control Center. I'll take these things back with me now, and as soon as I get more information, I'll let you know!" Hao Xinmei was swift in her actions; the moment she received Zhu Tianlei's call, she contacted both individuals.</p><p>"Xiao Mei, you are truly wonderful!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't expect Hao Xinmei to act so quickly. His heart was filled with excitement and emotion as he stretched out his hands towards Hao Xinmei.</p><p>"Just stop it, I'm leaving now! Wait for my message!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei seemed to have anticipated Zhu Tianlei's move. Before his hands could reach her, she leaped away.</p><p>"Xiao Mei, thank you for your hard work!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't feel disappointed by Hao Xinmei's evasion. The fact that she had rushed over without hesitation after receiving his call spoke volumes.</p><p>"Hmm!"</p><p>Watching Hao Xinmei rush away and drive off in her car, Zhu Tianlei couldn't quite pinpoint his emotions. This outcome was crucial to him.</p><p>Until dusk, Ma Lanlan hadn't returned to the clinic. Initially, Zhu Tianlei didn't think much of it, assuming she was just being a bit sullen and would soon return. However, after such a long time, he began to feel anxious.</p><p>After some thought, he decided to close the clinic and leisurely stroll down the alley towards the village entrance.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei visited all the places Ma Lanlan usually liked to go, but found no one. Calling her on her phone only resulted in it being switched off.</p><p>Only then did Zhu Tianlei start feeling truly worried.</p><p>It was already quite dark. Although they were in a village, she was still just a young girl and very beautiful, which made him feel uneasy.</p><p>After some more thought, Zhu Tianlei turned around and headed towards Ma Lanlan's home.</p><p>Ma Lanlan's home was in the opposite direction from the clinic because her father was a carpenter in the village with excellent skills. People not only from Hama Gou but also from surrounding villages would come to him for carpentry work.</p><p>Thus, Ma Lanlan's living conditions were quite good.</p><p>The courtyard was spacious, with a five-story mansion in front and back. The walls were covered with snow-white ceramic tiles, and the windows were bright and clean. Even Hu Daniu's house could not compare to it.</p><p>Having lived in the village for twenty years, Zhu Tianlei visited Ma Lanlan's home for the first time. Although he knew that Ma Lanlan's parents were unaware of his relationship with Lanlan, he still felt somewhat nervous, almost like a new son-in-law visiting.</p><p>"Tianlei, come into the yard quickly!"</p><p>The door was opened by Ma Lanlan's father, who resembled his mother in appearance and personality—round-faced and fair-skinned, charming and gentle.</p><p>"Uncle, I came to see Lanlan!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled, trying to appear steady. In the past, he had not cared what others thought of him; he lived as he pleased, content so long as he was happy. But now, he feared that any mistake might lead Ma Lanlan's parents to disapprove of him.</p><p>"Oh, come in quickly. I don't know what happened to this girl, Lanlan. She locked herself in her room ever since she came back and even skipped dinner."</p><p>Ma Chuanlin sighed with a look of concern on his face.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei initially felt relieved, but then his heart sank as he realized that the girl must be truly angry this time!</p><p>"Uncle, I'll go see what's wrong!"</p><p>"It's fine. Try to talk her down; you two are young and your words carry more weight than ours."</p><p>Ma Chuanlin had a simple nature and did not suspect anything untoward about the young man in front of him, even going so far as to offer him an opportunity.</p><p>"Alright, Uncle, I'll take care of it!"</p><p>Guided by Ma Chuanlin, Zhu Tianlei stood outside Ma Lanlan's door.</p><p>"Lanlan, it's me. Open the door!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei knocked on the door, trying to make his tone sound sincere and gentle.</p><p>However, after waiting for a while, there was no movement inside the house at all.</p><p>Could she be sleeping?</p><p>No, it's only not yet 7 o'clock; how could she possibly go to bed so early.</p><p>"Lanlan, open the door, okay? We should talk face to face. Look, you made me stand in the courtyard; it's really inconvenient!"</p><p>Having confirmed that Ma Lanlan was definitely not sleeping, Zhu Tianlei continued knocking on the door, but after about ten minutes of continuous knocking, there was still no response from inside.</p><p>"Lanlan, since you won't open the door, I'll go back first. When you want to talk to me, just let me know and I'll come!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sighed helplessly; his voice clearly carried through the door into the room.</p><p>"Screech!"</p><p>"Haha, I knew you wouldn't let me go!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei swiftly pulled Ma Lanlan inside the house, quickly slammed the door shut, and then immediately hugged her tightly.</p><p>"Lanlan, let go of me!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan was furious and tried desperately to break free from Zhu Tianlei's grasp.</p><p>"Hey Lanlan, keep it down! The old man is right outside!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei knew exactly what Ma Lanlan's weak spot was; indeed, after he said this, her movements gradually calmed down, though her expression remained ugly.</p><p>"Let me go!"</p><p>"I won't let go, you are my wife's daughter, I can hold you whenever I want!"</p><p>Oh oh oh, Zhu Tianlei rolled his eyes internally; this girl sure has a strong sense of jealousy.</p><p>"You are my wife's daughter, and if I say so, it's true!"</p>

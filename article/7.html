						<p>Ma Lanlan sat at the clinic desk, her eyes gazing out the window, where an imposing figure inexplicably appeared before her. This figure used to pass by her every day, but she had never desired its presence as much as she did now.</p><p>Hou Suqin chased after Tan Daquan's house, only to find that the child had already been born. She didn't see the miraculous scene of her son being revived, but from Tan Daquan's tearful and persistent embrace of his newborn, she faintly made a guess.</p><p>"Mom, what are you thinking about?"</p><p>Hou Suqin felt dazed, having just come out of Tan's courtyard, and immediately stared at her precious son. When Zhu Tianlei turned around, he saw his mother's thoughtful expression.</p><p>"Lei Zi, was that Tan family wife really the one who delivered your son?"</p><p>Hou Suqin pondered for a moment before asking.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hadn't expected his mother to be contemplating this matter all along; he secretly found it amusing and walked over to put an arm around Hou Suqin's shoulder.</p><p>"Mom, I'm not a midwife, so how could I deliver a baby? I just helped Aunt Guilan give some injections to give her the strength to give birth."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei wasn't lying, but he didn't mention the severity of the situation.</p><p>"How do you know how to give injections? I've never seen you do any sewing before!"</p><p>Puh!</p><p>Hearing his mother's innocent words and her serious, earnest expression, Zhu Tianlei felt extremely pleased!</p><p>"Haha, Mom, don't overthink it. Anyway, you and Dad will just have to look forward to enjoying life in the future!"</p><p>Although Hou Suqin didn't fully understand her son's answer, she was still elated with joy, her eyes welling up at his words.</p><p>Now, it was time for the flag-raising and morning exercises. On the playground, students from various grades stood together; even if there were six grades altogether, there were no more than a couple of dozen children. But bathed in the morning light, each child looked as fresh and delicate as a bud.</p><p>Suddenly, a graceful figure wearing a white sleeveless blouse appeared within Zhu Tianlei's line of sight.</p><p>A fairy!</p><p>That was Zhu Tianlei's first reaction. The fairy walked out from beside the teachers' office on the playground, her eyebrows perfectly arched like Mount Emei, her skin as fair as snow, and her black hair cascading down her shoulders. Underneath the white blouse, her breasts seemed to protrude prominently like haystacks in a paddy field.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt as though he had been enchanted; no matter how hard he tried, he could not move forward.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue, who had just come out of the office, took a deep breath. It truly was a rural area—both the air and sunlight exuded an original simplicity and naturalness. Just breathing in that atmosphere made one feel warm inside.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was not bad-looking; he had thick eyebrows and big eyes that always seemed to carry a hint of a smile. Standing at 180 cm, he had broad shoulders and a narrow waist with well-defined muscles. In the city, he would undoubtedly be one of those who could make a living off their looks.</p><p>But who was Yang Xiaoxue? The daughter of the Education Bureau chief in Yunhai City; what kind of men hadn't she seen? She only glanced at Zhu Tianlei before turning her hips provocatively and entering the classroom.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt somewhat disappointed, tinged with faint self-doubt. His good mood had been darkened by this slightly provocative interlude. Hou Suqin was walking ahead; not seeing her son staring absentmindedly at a girl or indulging in fantasies, she only noticed his face turn from elated to solemn suddenly, which made her puzzled.</p><p>"Leizi, do you have something you're hiding from me and your mom?"</p><p>After breakfast, Zhu Quezi and Hou Suqin, for the first time ever, did not head out to work. Instead, after some deliberation, they went straight into the western room.</p><p>Zhu Quezi had already heard Auntie Fatty mention the incident that happened in Huludong yesterday, how Hu Dainiu had died but was brought back to life by his son's swift actions, how his son was said to be a reincarnation of Hua Tuo.</p><p>This should have been good news, but Zhu Quezi was one of those single-minded people who had always wanted to live honestly and till the earth all their lives. Such unexpected good fortune made him feel uneasy, so he needed to clarify things.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei leaned against the stack of quilts at the head of the bed, blinked his eyes, and knew he had to give his parents a reasonable explanation.</p><p>But what is reasonable, does it make sense for Zi Hui Yixian to consider himself the successor?</p><p>"Cough cough, Dad, Mom! Son is not filial enough!"</p><p>When Zhu Quezi heard Zhu Tianlei's words, his heart skipped a beat; it seemed there really was something serious. Zhu Tianlei had always been rebellious but never gave in, and this matter probably wasn't small.</p><p>"Tell me what's wrong. Regardless of what happens, I and your mom will take the blame for you!"</p><p>Zhu Quezi deliberately acted relaxed, while Zhu Tianlei felt both sour and warm inside. He paused before speaking again.</p><p>"Dad, do you remember that year when you hurt your leg, and I got lost in Black Tiger Forest and didn't come home all day and night?"</p><p>Zhu Quezi and Hou Suqin exchanged glances, nodding together. That time, the couple nearly went mad, searching the entire Black Tiger Forest upside down before finally finding their son, who had fallen asleep hungry in a ditch. How could they forget such an incident?</p><p>"Actually, I went to Black Tiger Forest on purpose that time. I heard there was a highly skilled doctor there, so I wanted to ask him to help treat your leg."</p><p>Hearing his son say this, Zhu Quezi's eyes welled up with tears. It turned out his son had done it for him; back then, he had been furious and even severely beaten his son.</p><p>"Was there really a doctor in Black Tiger Forest?"</p><p>It took Zhu Quezi a while to react, asking in shock.</p><p>"Yes, I found that doctor and begged him for a long time. Eventually, after my relentless pleading, he agreed to take me as an apprentice and has been teaching me medicine ever since. However, there was one condition: I couldn't let anyone know I had medical skills until he gave his permission."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked very innocent, secretly clapping himself on the back for his acting like a TV drama.</p><p>"Really, there was a doctor! So does that doctor now allow you to use your medical skills?"</p><p>Zhu Quezi really believed him, given that Zhu Tianlei frequently visited Black Tiger Forest; he spent about half of each month in the forest. He hadn't realized it before but now understood.</p><p>"Yes, that doctor said he was getting old and wanted to travel around. He won't return, and he asked me to use my medical skills to benefit the people of Hamaogou Village."</p><p>That Purple Embrace Medical Immortal ascending to heaven and becoming a deity must not be able to return! I’m not lying about this!</p>

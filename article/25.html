						<p>Hao Xinmei's office was located on the top floor, with only a secretary room, a tea break room, and a relaxation area; everything else was her workspace.</p><p>The enormous floor-to-ceiling glass windows offered a panoramic view of Cloudsea City.</p><p>Inside the office, aside from a massive boss desk, a set of black leather sofas, and an equally huge marine ecosystem aquarium, there was nothing else, making it indeed quite empty.</p><p>"I rarely stay in my office."</p><p>Hao Xinmei spoke little, of course, except when discussing Hua Rong.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's eyes darted around before coming up with this idea. He had figured out that to build a relationship with Hao Xinmei, he needed to be proactive—bold and shameless—and not rely on her initiative; otherwise, the attempt might fizzle out before it even started.</p><p>"Whatever you want!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hadn't expected Hao Xinmei to be so agreeable. The momentary disappointment instantly dissipated as he shifted his position slightly to face Hao Xinmei with a grin.</p><p>"Little Mei, Hua Rong's illness has been cured, and his health is excellent—he eats heartily. See..."</p><p>Hao Xinmei raised her head and gave Zhu Tianlei a cold glance, but he was unfazed. Flirting without some spirit of 'not fearing hardship or danger' couldn't succeed.</p><p>"I'll treat you to dinner!"</p><p>"Eating dinner~"!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's voice stretched out.</p><p>"Don't you want to go?"</p><p>"Yes, how could I not? Being able to have dinner with you, Little Mei, is something I've been eagerly looking forward to!"</p><p>"Little Li, come to my office for a moment, and bring me what you were given yesterday!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei pressed the phone on her desk, and soon enough, a young man wearing a silver-gray summer suit walked in.</p><p>The man was 1.8 meters tall with broad shoulders, narrow waist, slightly curled short hair, fair skin, clear eyes, and a faint smile on his face.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt uncomfortable. Why did a woman have a male secretary around her, and why did she need to be so handsome?</p><p>"Hao Manager, here is what you wanted."</p><p>Little Li seemed to ignore Zhu Tianlei's presence and walked straight to Hao Xinmei after entering the room, placing a small box on Hao Xinmei's desk.</p><p>"Little Li, take Hua Rong back home for me. The dog food is still in the cabinet above the kitchen counter. Don't forget to give him a bowl of clean water."</p><p>"Hao Manager, is Hua Rong's illness cured?"</p><p>Little Li sounded very happy, which made Zhu Tianlei feel even more uncomfortable. What kind of relationship did they have? He knew Hao Xinmei's home and where she kept the dog food.</p><p>"It's not your dog, so why are you so happy?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't hold it in any longer and said sarcastically. Little Li turned around upon hearing this and only then realized that Zhu Tianlei was sitting on the sofa, looking puzzled.</p><p>"Little Li, go ahead!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei ignored Zhu Tianlei and handed Hua Rong directly to Little Li. Seeing Hua Rong snuggling into Little Li's arms made Zhu Tianlei even more heartbroken.</p><p>"You little bastard, you really are a traitor. You're not this close with me who saved your life! Just wait until I get my hands on your mom; be careful I don't starve you!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't dare to say these things to Hao Xinmei and instead cursed Hua Rong inwardly for his ingratitude. Little Hua Rong suddenly sneezed in Little Li's arms, looking at Zhu Tianlei innocently.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei? Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was still lost in his imagination of a beautiful future life with Hao Xinhui, completely unaware of when Xiao Li had left or when Hao Xinhui had arrived before him.</p><p>"Cough cough... Xiaomei, who was that guy just now?"</p><p>"My administrative assistant."</p><p>Hao Xinhui replied and directly handed the box in her hand to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"What's this?"</p><p>"It's a phone!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei opened the box and found the phone to be palm-sized with an arc-shaped screen, black and mirror-polished.</p><p>maters Porsche.</p><p>He had seen this model of phone on TV before; at that time, he had fantasized about buying one in every color once he was rich, using a red one during the day and a black one at night.</p><p>"My phone number is already programmed into it. Let's go eat!"</p><p>When Hao Xinhui said these words, her face turned slightly red, and her tone was a bit unnatural. This faint awkwardness made all the displeasure Zhu Tianlei had felt upon seeing his administrative assistant disappear instantly.</p><p>It seems Hao Xinhui does have some feelings for me!</p><p>Hao Xinhui walked ahead, feeling the intense gaze from behind like flames, causing her heart to race and the sound of her high heels on the ground growing more frequent.</p><p>Outside, a black Audi Q8 was parked at the door. A young man in a white suit approached and opened the car door.</p><p>"General Hao, the restaurant is already reserved!"</p><p>"Alright, get in the car!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei turned back to greet Zhu Tianlei before bending down and entering the vehicle, with the door closing behind her.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stared at the male driver, who was even more handsome than that Li, feeling a shadow loom over him. Would he even have a chance? Why did a woman need to hire male employees?</p><p>Even after arriving at the restaurant, Zhu Tianlei's sour taste hadn't dissipated. Fortunately, the white-suited driver didn't follow him in; otherwise, Zhu Tianlei wasn't sure if he could have eaten his meal.</p><p>The dishes had already been ordered beforehand, and as soon as they sat down, the food began to be served.</p><p>"This......this......"</p><p>Looking at the dishes on the table, Zhu Tianlei almost dropped his eyes. What was this? Hao Xinmei didn't seem like a stingy person; how could there not be a single piece of meat on the entire table?</p><p>"Sir, your meal is ready. Enjoy!"</p><p>The waitress smiled sweetly, her lips curling upwards and her eyes sparkling like two little stars. Zhu Tianlei gritted his teeth and decided to put up with it for the sake of her appearance.</p><p>"Meyi, you......"</p><p>"Don't talk while eating!"</p><p>Eh!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's enthusiasm was immediately doused, and he nearly clenched his teeth as he finished his meal.</p><p>"Madam, your total is one thousand eight hundred and sixty yuan!"</p><p>"What? How much?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei thought he had misheard. What did he eat—a pile of spinach leaves—and it cost him eighteen hundred yuan? Wasn't this a black hole restaurant?</p><p>"Sir, the dishes you just enjoyed are our store's newly introduced organic vegetables, which are free from harmful substances and entirely natural. They were personally cooked by a Michelin-star chef, with only five servings available each day."</p><p>The waiter provided detailed answers, but Rui Tianlei could not help but feel a touch of disdain in his eyes.</p><p>Watching Hao Xin calmly hand over the card, Rui Tianlei felt his heart ache. How wasteful! Organic vegetables? Even if they were gilded with gold, they would still be just vegetables!</p><p>Thinking about how one meal of greens had consumed the entire harvest from two acres of land for a year, Rui Tianlei found it hard to describe his feelings.</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from the door of the private room.</p><p>"Country bumpkin is country bumpkin, and that fact will never change no matter where you go!"</p>

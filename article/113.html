						<p>Zhu Tianlei did not ask a single question; he simply coddled the little woman in his arms as if she were a child.</p><p>Another half an hour or so passed, and Hao Xinmei extricated herself from Zhu Tianlei's embrace. Although she still looked weary, there was a renewed determination in her eyes.</p><p>"Tianlei, I'm fine now, I worried you!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei was indeed Hao Xinmei; no matter how much setbacks and blows she endured, she quickly regained her footing after a brief rest.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei reached out gently, tucking the stray strands of hair by Hao Xinmei's face behind her ear. The pain in his heart washed over him like waves, hard to conceal as it was still evident in his eyes and mind.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei straightened his expression.</p><p>"Nothing, I can handle it."</p><p>Hao Xinmei blurted out unconsciously.</p><p>"Alright, I won't push you."</p><p>Hao Xinmei was surprised; she did not expect Zhu Tianlei to be so accommodating.</p><p>"But there is one thing you must promise me."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"You should go home now and rest properly. We can talk about anything after you've had some rest."</p><p>"No need, I'm fine, I... alright, I'll go home!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei tried to refuse again but saw Zhu Tianlei's stern face and lost her nerve. Looking at her disheveled clothes, she felt it was indeed necessary to go home for a wash and change of clothes.</p><p>"Xiao Chen, call the driver for Mr. Hao and ask her to take him home!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei covered his mouth and shouted at Xiao Chen who was still sobbing outside. Xiao Chen looked blank for a moment, then glanced at Hao Xinmei before obediently walking over to the office phone.</p><p>"I thought you would take me home."</p><p>Hao Xinmei's tone was faint, tinged with a hint of disappointment.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei knew exactly how she felt, but he had more pressing matters to attend to.</p><p>"Xiao Mei, even if I stay, I can't do much for you. Why don't you leave me here to clean up the office?"</p><p>"That's okay!"</p><p>The driver soon parked the car at the entrance of the building. Zhu Tianlei saw Hao Xinmei off to the ground floor and watched her get into the car, maintaining a warm smile and speaking gently throughout.</p><p>However, once the car disappeared from sight, Zhu Tianlei's smile vanished instantly.</p><p>The security guards noticed Zhu Tianlei return with a stern expression on his face, causing each of them to shiver in fear as he approached.</p><p>This time, they were unusually well-behaved, not even daring to glance at him. Could it be that sharing the same air as him was also forbidden?</p><p>"You, come over!"</p><p>The security guard called Pan An was singled out. His name was legendary for its beauty, but his appearance was far from appealing.</p><p>Pan An had escaped the previous incident mainly due to good fortune. When Zhu Tianlei arrived, Pan An had a stomach ache so severe that he couldn't get out of bed, inadvertently avoiding trouble.</p><p>However, being called out by Zhu Tianlei now gave him an eerie feeling as if he could not escape his fate.</p><p>"I ask you, who has visited Meixin Pharmaceutical previously?"</p><p>Pan An heard Zhu Tianlei's question instead of immediately reacting with force, and he regained some calmness in his heart.</p><p>"Our Meixin Pharmaceutical is a business-oriented company. Many people come and go every day, at least tens if not hundreds. The boss asked me this, and I really don't know how to answer it properly!"</p><p>Pan An didn't know Zhu Tianlei's name and dared not use the word "you," so after some thought, he used the vague term "the boss."</p><p>"Suspicious."</p><p>"Suspicious?"</p><p>Pan An repeated the word, not understanding what Zhu Tianlei meant by it. However, he dared not ask further and could only think to himself while carefully observing Zhu Tianlei's facial expression.</p><p>"Oh, I remember now. About two hours ago, there were seven or eight people who looked very fierce and didn't seem like they came for business. We stopped them to inquire, but they said they had made an appointment with Mr. Hao. We called Secretary Chen to verify it, and it was indeed confirmed that Mr. Hao had made the appointment, so we didn't stop them anymore. Apart from these few people, there were no other suspicious individuals!"</p><p>Pan An spoke in detail. Seeing no change in Zhu Tianlei's expression, Pan An secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>"Alright, I understand!"</p><p>After finishing his question, Zhu Tianlei left briskly and reentered the lobby.</p><p>Pan An patted his chest, damn it, he felt like he had just stepped into hell!</p><p>"Little Chen, what exactly happened?"</p><p>Back in the office, Zhu Tianlei summoned Little Chen.</p><p>Little Chen tugged at her dress hem, stammering for a long time without saying a single word.</p><p>"Little Chen, although you haven't been with the company for long, you should know what kind of person Mr. Hao is and what kind of enterprise Meixin Pharmaceutical is. Do you want to leave such an enterprise?"</p><p>Little Chen suddenly looked up.</p><p>However, the young man before her knew that if he wanted to make her leave, it would be as easy as turning over his hand. But Mr. Hao had specifically instructed not to let him know about this!</p><p>Xiao Chen found herself in a dilemma, hesitating and almost on the verge of tears.</p><p>"I think you can guess my relationship with Mr. Hao. I don't have any other intentions; I just don't want to see her bullied. I'm sure you feel the same way too!"</p><p>Xiao Chen blinked her eyes. Yes, Mr. Hao was such a kind person; why should she endure this? Although this man didn't seem extraordinary at first glance, Xiao Chen knew that anyone who could be with Mr. Hao must have been quite remarkable.</p><p>"Alright, I'll say it!"</p><p>Finally, Xiao Chen made up her mind.</p><p>"The deputy head of our company's planning department, Chen Guangming, suddenly fainted in the office a few days ago. Mr. Hao personally arranged for someone to take him to the hospital, covering all medical expenses and ensuring he rested."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback; this plot seemed familiar!</p><p>"However, we didn't expect that yesterday, Chen Guangming suddenly filed a complaint against the company and Mr. Hao with the Labor Bureau. This in itself wouldn't be a problem, but Chen Guangming's elder brother and younger brother were not good people. They first started harassing Mr. Hao by phone and even intercepted his car on the road."</p><p>Xiao Chen spoke while fuming.</p><p>"These people are nothing but scoundrels, demanding that Mr. Hao compensate Chen Guangming with one million yuan in a lump sum. Of course, Mr. Hao wouldn't agree to this. As a result, they contacted the city television station and newspapers, threatening to expose Meixin Pharmaceutical, revealing the true face of the company's capitalists to all of Yunhai City."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei listened intently, unaware that the veins in his hand were bulging.</p><p>"You know that even if those people were spreading malicious rumors, exposure would still have a significant impact on the company. Mr. Hao couldn't agree to this. Unbelievably, these people found the company this morning without saying much and started smashing things. Afterward, they threatened Mr. Hao, giving him one more day to think."</p><p>"Where is Chen Guangming now?"</p><p>"He's at the city hospital. Hey... where are you going?"</p>

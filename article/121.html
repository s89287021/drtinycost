						<p>“Knock knock knock!”</p><p>At that moment, a sudden knocking sound rang out.</p><p>The person who entered was Zhao Jing, a newly hired marketing department clerk, specifically responsible for receiving orders. However, since production had just started, there were no orders yet, so Zhu Tianlei and Mao Yu both found it somewhat strange when they saw Zhao Jing in front of them.</p><p>"Mr. Zhu, Mr. Mao, we have an order!"</p><p>What?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei and Mao Yu quickly exchanged glances, seeing disbelief in each other's eyes.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei almost immediately snatched the order from Zhao Jing's hands.</p><p>"Three hundred thousand......"</p><p>The order clearly stated that the five Chinese medicines of Tianlei Pharmaceutical were each pre-ordered for fifty thousand yuan by the other party.</p><p>"Do you know which company or pharmacy placed the order?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, as if remembering something, urgently asked Zhao Jing.</p><p>"It was ordered by someone named Zhang Ye, and the advance payment has already been transferred to our company account. I just verified it with the accountant."</p><p>Advance payment transferred? </p><p>Zhu Tianlei and Mao Yu exchanged glances again, finally breaking into smiles.</p><p>No matter who this Zhang Ye was, they were grateful to him, no, to his ancestors for eight generations.</p><p>Because of this order, the entire Tianlei Pharmaceutical Company was immersed in excitement and joy. Everyone was full of energy, wishing that an hour could be split into two.</p><p>A week later, the first order's medication was processed on time and in quantity, and the remaining payment was deposited into their account within ten minutes of confirming the order.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei and Mao Yu watched as the cargo truck slowly drove out of the factory compound, both heaving a sigh of relief.</p><p>What they didn't expect was that just one week later, this person named Zhang Ye placed another order, primarily for Beauty Pill. He even preordered 3,000 boxes of the Beauty Pill alone. Zhu Tianlei wanted to meet this Zhang Ye, but the other party claimed to be too busy and kept declining invitations, so Zhu Tianlei didn't insist.</p><p>This Zhang Ye was very reliable, as he paid the full amount for the second order directly.</p><p>However, the more dependable he seemed, the more suspicious Zhu Tianlei became.</p><p>Tianlei Pharmaceutical's financial policy was to produce only after receiving 60% of the advance payment and ship the goods after collecting the remaining 40%. Yet, this party paid the full amount upfront—how could anyone afford such an expenditure!</p><p>Therefore, shortly after the cargo truck left the factory, Zhu Tianlei followed it in his jeep.</p><p>The truck sped out of Hamagou and headed towards Yunhai City.</p><p>Once inside the city limits, the truck slowed down. Zhu Tianlei didn't dare follow too closely, but fortunately, the truck stopped soon after entering a warehouse area.</p><p>Zhang Ye got out of the car, and someone immediately took over for him—a person whom Zhu Tianlei recognized.</p><p>Half an hour later:</p><p>"Little Mei, you really went to great lengths!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei got out of his jeep and slowly approached the warehouse door, addressing a slender figure.</p><p>Hao Xinhui was startled and turned around to see Zhu Tianlei standing behind her.</p><p>She pursed her lips, thinking she had done such a perfect job, forgetting how perceptive Zhu Tianlei was!</p><p>"Tianlei......"</p><p>Hao Xinmei was afraid that Zhu Tianlei would overthink things, so she came up with this plan. She didn't expect it to be uncovered in the end, leaving her feeling a bit guilty.</p><p>"Little Mei, I know you meant well, but if the company's development has to rely on your help, then what's the point of me running the company? It would be better if I just came to work for you directly!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei naturally understood Hao Xinmei's intentions. Although he was clearly unhappy inside, his tone remained very gentle.</p><p>"Tianlei, I know it wasn't right to keep this from you, but there's something I hope you understand: I am also a businessman. While I do want to help you, I won't blindly support you. The reason why I quickly placed another order after the first one was completed is that the sales of these medications have been extremely good, and I've made quite a bit of money!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei explained with a chuckle.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned, clearly disbelieving.</p><p>"Come, let me show you!"</p><p>Meixin Pharmaceutical is an agent for pharmaceutical products, so it has not only affiliated pharmacies but also several direct-operated stores. At this moment, Hao Xinmei brought Zhu Tianlei to one of Meixin Pharmaceutical's direct-operated stores.</p><p>"Hello, I'd like to buy two boxes of Beauty Pill."</p><p>Hao Xinmei smiled at the pharmacist and said.</p><p>"Customer, I'm sorry, but Beauty Pill has been very popular lately. We've run out for the past two days, and the inventory from headquarters hasn't arrived yet. Why don't you leave your phone number? I'll call you once the stock is back in."</p><p>The Meixin Pharmaceutical staff member was clearly well-trained, with impeccable service attitude and sales skills.</p><p>"No need, I'll come back in a couple of days!"</p><p>After leaving the pharmacy, Hao Xinmei looked at Zhu Tianlei with a smile and then led him to another nearby pharmacy.</p><p>"Beauty Pill, sis, to be honest, once the stock arrives, we staff members will keep most of it for ourselves. The effectiveness is truly remarkable. Hehe, sis, you don't have to go anywhere else; I'm sure no one can resist waiting for Meixin Pharmaceutical's next batch of stock!"</p><p>When they left the pharmacy, Hao Xinmei looked at Zhu Tianlei with a smug expression.</p><p>"How about it?"</p><p>"What how about it?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pretended to be dumbfounded.</p><p>"Haha, look at your silly face. Tianlei, I want to tell you that the popularity of Beauty Elixir has completely exceeded my expectations. Recently, the calls for ordering Beauty Elixir have been almost overwhelming."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hadn't expected Beauty Elixir to be so popular either and felt a bit smug for a moment.</p><p>"Tianlei, now I need to take advantage of my advantageous position and use some connections."</p><p>"What kind of connections?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback.</p><p>"Hahaha, I want to become the exclusive agent for Beauty Elixir. Do you agree or not?"</p><p>Hao Xinmei tilted her head back, looking cute in every way.</p><p>A spark of anger surged within Zhu Tianlei; he wished he could immediately punish this little woman on the spot.</p><p>"Hmph, wishful thinking. Right now, there are people lining up to become agents. If you want to be an agent, you better make me satisfied!"</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>On Hao Xinmei's double bed, two figures were entangled together.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, let go of me!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei felt as if her bones were being tormented until they would fall apart, but Zhu Tianlei's strength was astonishing. His hands roamed all over her body.</p><p>"Hehe, Xiaomei, look, your body is more honest than you are."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's lips landed on the snowy peaks, his fingers lightly brushing over the red plum blossoms atop the peaks, allowing them to bloom slowly from their buds.</p><p>The other hand traveled across the plains, gradually sliding down into the lush stream area. His fingers transformed into little boats, dispersing the water grass to both sides as he explored and delved in freedom.</p><p>"Zhu Tian......Tianlei.......I don't want......"</p>

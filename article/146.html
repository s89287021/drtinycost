						<p>"Qin Zhuang, it's my fault. If you're angry at anyone, it should be me. Vent all your anger on me and let Xiu xiu go....."</p><p>"Pah, Kangzi, I didn't give you a chance? It was you who refused to see reason. For the sake of a woman, you even disowned your own big brother! You liked her, right? Now that I've ruined her, we can still be brothers!"</p><p>A hint of madness appeared in Qin Zhuang's eyes.</p><p>Lu Kang's body trembled violently as he desperately tried to rush forward, only to be grabbed by Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Let me go, I want to save Xiu xiu......"</p><p>"With you standing there so unstable, do you really think you can save someone?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's cold voice was like a bucket of cold water, snapping Lu Kang back to reality. However, he absolutely could not watch his woman being destroyed.</p><p>He had followed Qin Zhuang for more than ten years and knew the other man to be ruthless and merciless. He could die, but Xiu xiu couldn't.</p><p>"Plop!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was stunned.</p><p>Looking at Lu Kang kneeling on all fours in front of him.</p><p>On that day, when they first met, Lu Kang had said that if he lost, he would kneel down for Qin Zhuang. Little did he think that those words would come true a few months later.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, please, please save Xiu xiu. All the blame is on me. As long as you can save her, I Lu Kang will be willing to serve you like an ox or horse to repay your great kindness....."</p><p>A man in his thirties, tears streaming down his face, sobbing bitterly.</p><p>"Kangzi, you really shame your father with this. Kneeling for this little whore—since that's the case, we can't keep this woman anymore!"</p><p>Qin Zhuang was holding Zheng Xiu xiu, so he couldn't do anything about it himself.</p><p>"Huaizi, do this little wench for me!"</p><p>This Huaizi was none other than the Oily Man.</p><p>The Oily Man had always hidden in the crowd to minimize his presence. Seriously, at this moment, he didn't want anything more than to save his life, let alone achieve glory.</p><p>But hiding proved futile.</p><p>Inside, the Oily Man cursed Qin Zhang and Zhu Tianlei several times. If he had come forward then, wouldn't he have ended up right in Zhu Tianlei's hands? What good would that be?</p><p>But if he didn't go, he couldn't stay in Black Eagle Society either. He knew very well what Qin Zhang was capable of—stripping him naked would be considered light punishment.</p><p>"Ahh, ahhh, my stomach hurts so much... it feels like I'm dying..."</p><p>Even a fool could see through this act, but the Oily Man played his role with great intensity.</p><p>"Damnit, Liang'er, help me......"</p><p>"Ahhh, ahhh, what did I eat wrong? I'm going to die from the pain..."</p><p>Qin Zhang watched as his usual subordinates, who were usually so arrogant and wanted to inflate their egos like balloons, now clutched their stomachs and moaned like women in labor. This sight made him see red.</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but sneer.</p><p>A bunch of cowards who bullied the weak and lacked courage—no wonder they were just one character off from Black Eagle Gang but their reputation was millions of miles apart.</p><p>"Hmph, I can kill that brat, and I can also kill you..."</p><p>Qin Zhang's face turned dark as he hooked up a fallen saber with his toes.</p><p>"Overreaching!"</p><p>Just as the machete landed in Qin Zhuang's hands, Zhu Tianlei lunged forward like a bolt of lightning. Qin Zhuang's body was immediately sent flying, and the machete slipped from his grasp, its cold gleam slicing through the air like an icy blade.</p><p>Having brushed with death, Zheng Xiuxiu's legs gave way, and she collapsed to the ground.</p><p>"Was that baby girl killed by you?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not ignore Qin Zhuang's words.</p><p>"Humph, a bastard. Alive or dead, it's all a burden. Better off dead!"</p><p>Qin Zhuang's gaze was cold, cold beyond measure.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's eyes were even colder than Qin Zhuang's, but this chill was not one of cruelty; rather, it was the icy intent to freeze everything in its tracks.</p><p>"I think the world would be better off without people like you."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was furious.</p><p>That tiny infant, so small and fragile like a budding flower, should have been pitied even when held in one's palm. Yet, someone had actually coldly dealt it such a fatal blow.</p><p>The baby's body bore numerous bruises, and the purplish face kept flashing through Zhu Tianlei's mind. He stomped on Qin Zhuang's severed arm with full force.</p><p>With all his strength.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's full strength could split trees with his palm and shatter stones with his fist. This single kick completely crushed Qin Zhuang's arm.</p><p>"Ahhh!"</p><p>Qin Zhuang's anguished scream echoed through the room.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei kicked a second time.</p><p>This kick landed on Qin Zhuang's chest, breaking three ribs at once.</p><p>Another kick hit Qin Zhuang's head.</p><p>The position was identical to that of the baby girl.</p><p>But just as everyone thought Qin Zhuang would surely die, Zhu Tianlei stopped his actions.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, let him go!"</p><p>These words were spoken by Lu Kang.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned; he didn't want to let him go. This wasn't a person but an animal.</p><p>"He is the father of the child......"</p><p>What?</p><p>The moment Lu Kang finished speaking, all the wailing in the room abruptly stopped.</p><p>That baby girl was Qin Zhuang's child?</p><p>Qin Zhuang had been killed by his own daughter?</p><p>Zheng Xiuxiu had been crying continuously. Upon hearing Lu Kang's words, she didn't refute but almost confirmed it.</p><p>"It's impossible, it's impossible, you're lying, you must be lying, how could that little brat possibly be my...... my daughter......"</p><p>Impossible, that child was the offspring conceived by Zheng Xiuxiu and Lu Kang behind his back, how could it be his child? Impossible, they must have been trying to make him suffer, so they lied.</p><p>"I and XiuXiu have remained innocent up to this point. Our mutual affection is genuine, but we have never done anything that would harm you. However, XiuXiu did not want her child to grow up in such an environment or have a heartless father, so she asked me to take her away and find a place where no one knew us, to start a new life..."</p><p>Lu Kang spoke while Zheng XiuXiu cried beside him.</p><p>"That is why I kidnapped Ge Yang, hoping to extort money from Ge Tianhang, which would allow me to take XiuXiu and the child away. Little did I know that Zhu Tianlei stumbled upon us, causing this plan to be delayed. Furthermore, XiuXiu's pregnancy was unstable, forcing us to change our plans."</p><p>Qin Zhang stared at Lu Kang like he was an idiot.</p><p>"On the day of XiuXiu's delivery, you suddenly attacked and tried to strangle her. That is why XiuXiu had no choice but to stab you with a knife and flee with the child. I went looking for them without your knowledge and discovered that XiuXiu and the child had inadvertently been rescued by Zhu Tianlei again. Thus, we pretended not to have found them and secretly arranged for the mother and daughter to stay in a small house."</p><p>A scene appeared before Qin Zhang's eyes as he led his men to find Zheng XiuXiu and her daughter, seeing that pretty baby with features identical to Zheng XiuXiu. He captured both of them.</p><p>But every time he saw that child, he felt insulted, for the child was the best evidence that Qin Zhang had been cheated on.</p><p>So that night, he reached out his hand.</p>

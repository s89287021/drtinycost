						<p>"Thank you for saving my daughter, but I won't tell you anything. After I rest a bit, I'll take her away!"</p><p>The woman said that and leaned against the trash can by the roadside, closing her eyes as if she had lost all vitality.</p><p>Hao Xinmei was somewhat afraid, while Zhu Tianlei shook his head at Hao Xinmei.</p><p>This woman wasn't lying; the blood on her body wasn't hers. What could have happened to make so much blood be on her? Could it be...?</p><p>"I'm leaving!"</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei formed a certain conjecture in his mind, the woman suddenly opened her eyes, wobbled to her feet, and directly reached into Hao Xinmei's arms to snatch the child away. The tiny baby who had been safely cradled by Hao Xinmei was suddenly taken away, causing it to cry out in fear.</p><p>But the woman seemed oblivious, hugging the child tightly and rushing away!</p><p>Her figure and speed made it completely unimaginable that this person could be connected to the woman who had just collapsed next to the trash can, almost without a sound.</p><p>"What an odd person!"</p><p>This was Hao Xinmei's first time holding a baby. The tiny, soft body suddenly triggered her maternal instincts as a woman, making her feel very uncomfortable seeing the child being taken away.</p><p>"Haha, you're so attached! We'll just have our own in the future!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't take it to heart; it was better if she left to avoid unnecessary trouble.</p><p>"Pah, who would want to have a child with you!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei blushed from Zhu Tianlei's words but found herself inexplicably imagining that kind of life.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei chuckled twice and didn't feel like teasing anymore. It was already very late, and he wondered if Yao Gang was still at the hotel or if Min Shengjun knew about Li Xu's car accident.</p><p>"Now, please do me a favor, Ms. Hao, and take your husband back to the hotel!"</p><p>"Thank you for saving my daughter, but I won't tell you anything. After I rest a bit, I'll take her away!"</p><p>The woman spoke and leaned against the trash can by the roadside, closing her eyes as if she had lost all vitality.</p><p>Hao Xinmei felt somewhat afraid, while Zhu Tianlei shook his head at Hao Xinmei.</p><p>This woman wasn't lying; the blood on her was not hers.

After I rest a bit, I'll take her away!"</p><p>The woman spoke and leaned against the trash can by the roadside, closing her eyes as if she had lost all vitality.</p><p>Hao Xinmei felt a shiver of fear run through her, while Zhu Tianlei shook his head at Hao Xinmei in silent agreement.</p><p>This woman wasn't lying; the blood on her was not hers. What could have caused such a profusion of blood to cover her? Could it be...?</p><p>"I'm leaving!"</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei formed a conjecture in his mind, the woman suddenly opened her eyes and wobbled to her feet. She reached into Hao Xinmei's arms and snatched the child away with a swift motion. The tiny baby, who had been safely cradled by Hao Xinmei, was suddenly taken from her, causing it to cry out in fear.</p><p>But the woman seemed oblivious to the commotion, hugging the child tightly and rushing away!</p><p>Her figure and speed were so incongruent with the almost lifeless woman who had just collapsed next to the trash can that one could hardly believe they were the same person.</p><p>"What an odd person!"</p><p>This was Hao Xinmei's first time holding a baby. The tiny, soft body suddenly awakened her maternal instincts as a woman, making her feel very uncomfortable seeing the child taken away.</p><p>"Haha, you're so attached! We'll just have our own in the future!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't take it to heart; if she left, it would save them unnecessary trouble.</p><p>"Pah, who would want to have a child with you!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei blushed at Zhu Tianlei's words but found herself inexplicably imagining that kind of life.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei chuckled twice and didn't feel like teasing anymore. It was already very late, and he wondered if Yao Gang was still at the hotel or if Min Shengjun knew about Li Xu's car accident.</p><p>"Now, please do me a favor, Ms. Hao, and take your husband back to the hotel!"</p><p>"Pah! Pah! Pah!"</p><p>Facing Zhu Tianlei's roguish behavior, Hao Xinmei felt both embarrassed and annoyed.</p><p>"Stinky brat, I ask you, did you see a stinky woman?"</p><p>Before Zhu Tianlei could get in the car, four men suddenly rushed over from the opposite side of the road. Judging by their appearance and attire, they didn't seem to be good guys. Especially the one speaking, who was broad-shouldered with dark, shiny skin, and wore a thick gold chain around his neck.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not want any conflict with these men; he could see at a glance that they were asking about the woman he had just seen.</p><p>"I didn't see her!"</p><p>"Move!"</p><p>This man did not linger and immediately led the other three away. However, at that moment, he stepped on a pool of blood on the ground.</p><p>The man's face darkened instantly, and following his gaze, which lingered for a moment on the car door, he naturally noticed the bloody handprint.</p><p>"Stinky brat, you dare to fool me?"</p><p>"I am not fooling you; I told the truth!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained calm.</p><p>"Pah! Do you think I'm blind? What's this? This is blood from that woman. Tell me where you hid her!"</p><p>The man with the gold chain looked menacing, his mouth revealing two dazzling golden teeth that complemented his necklace perfectly.</p><p>"I said I didn't see her, so I didn't see her. I am now preparing to go home; get out of my way!"</p><p>"F*ck off! You still dare to act tough in front of me? Go find out who Ye Wu is. If you know what's good for you, hand over the woman, and I'll spare your life!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's gaze coldly scanned over Yue Wu.</p><p>"Yue Wu? I've only heard of Yue Yunpeng. Who is Yue Wu, I have no idea!"</p><p>"You bastard, refusing to drink the toast and choosing the penalty drink instead! You three, give me a hand and smash this car. Even if you have to take it apart piece by piece, find that person for me!"</p><p>Yue Wu laughed cruelly; he was already certain that the person was in the car.</p><p>"Smash the car? Are you sure?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood still as moonlight fell on him, casting a somewhat blurry outline around his figure.</p><p>"Haha, scared now? Listen up, in Yunhai City, no one dares to go against me!"</p><p>Yue Wu thought Zhu Tianlei was afraid and felt a surge of satisfaction in his heart.</p><p>"I'm just afraid you'll regret it!"</p><p>"You... still standing there? Smash the car for me. I want to see what skills you have to pull off such arrogance!"</p><p>The three men, upon receiving orders, one picked up a stone from the roadside and headed straight toward the car.</p><p>"Three."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei suddenly counted.</p><p>Jin Lianzi froze in shock, then burst into a wild laugh.</p><p>"Two."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke slowly, deliberately pausing after each number.</p><p>"One."</p><p>In the middle of the three, the first person raised a brick, but before he could throw it, he felt his wrist go numb. The brick slipped directly from his hand and fell right onto his feet.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Before this man's scream subsided, the other two people only saw a flash of darkness. When they came to their senses, they all felt a pain in their shoulders, and the bricks they were holding simultaneously dropped to the ground.</p><p>All this happened too fast!</p><p>A dark shadow flickered across Jin Lianzi's face.</p><p>"Waste of space! Useless scoundrels, get out of my way!"</p><p>Jin Lianzi bellowed, then glared fiercely at Zhu Tianlei before charging towards him with his massive body.</p><p>"F*ck!"</p><p>Jin Lianzi charged at nothing, and when he looked for Zhu Tianlei again, the latter had somehow moved to the periphery. After cursing, Jin Lianzi lunged at him once more, but it ended in failure just as before. This repeated several times until Jin Lianzi was panting from exhaustion, having not even touched Zhu Tianlei's sleeve.</p><p>"You three are fools! Attack me!"</p><p>Failing on his own, Jin Lianzi called out for the three to attack together.</p><p>Hao Xinhui sat in the car. Although she was still nervous, she was no longer afraid, knowing of Zhu Tianlei's prowess—these four people were not a match for him at all.</p><p>Sure enough, even before Hao Xinhui's thoughts had settled, outside the window, Jin Lianzi and his three companions fell to the ground like lifeless dogs, while Zhu Tianlei stood calmly in the middle with his arms behind his back, his sleeves fluttering slightly without any dirt on him.</p><p>"You... you brat, if you have guts, don't move!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Jin Lianzi with a faint smile, saying nothing. This only added to the panic of the others. Jin Lianzi waved his hand, and one of them—a small man with a sharp face—quickly scrambled up from the ground and dashed away.</p><p>"Got guts, don't leave!"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei's body move slightly, Jin Chain said hatefully.</p><p>"Do you think I can keep you here if you want to go? Hmm?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei found it amusing; did this Jin Chain really believe that he would care about such talk about having guts or not? Only his own woman knew whether Zhu Tianlei had guts or not.</p><p>"Hmph, do you know who my Ye Wu works for?"</p><p>When Jin Chain said this, his tone was filled with pride and arrogance.</p><p>However, before Ye Wu could finish boasting, they heard a rush of footsteps approaching.</p>

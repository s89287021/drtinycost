						<p>"Zhu Tianlei, what are you really up to?"</p><p>Yang Zhongmin was pushed into the passenger seat by Zhu Tianlei. Halfway through the journey, Zhu remained silent, which made Yang Zhongmin unable to contain himself anymore.</p><p>He was truly terrified!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had dared to abduct him from the county government office—what other daring or impossible things could he not do?</p><p>"Die."</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, that child wasn't killed on my orders. Although I, Yang Zhongmin, want revenge, I'm not so despicable as to harm a little kid. They acted on their own and it has nothing to do with me!"</p><p>"Didn’t you approve of this?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned his head.</p><p>"I...I..."</p><p>Yang Zhongmin hesitated for a moment, then suddenly moved his hand, opening the car door, clearly intending to jump out.</p><p>The jeep was moving at high speed, and as soon as the door opened, wind rushed in.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, even if I die, I will drag you down with me!"</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei saw the car door open, Yang Zhongmin grabbed his arm. The car then emitted a shrill screeching sound as it veered off towards the nearby mountain road.</p><p>"Go to hell, Zhu Tianlei!"</p><p>Yang Zhongmin finished speaking and was about to jump out of the car. Zhu Tianlei had one foot firmly pressing on the brake pedal while grabbing Yang Zhongmin's collar with his hand.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, let me go, let me go......"</p><p>Yang Zhongmin did not really want to die. He had not yet enjoyed his villa, luxury car, and savings in the bank account; how could he afford to die?</p><p>The reason he chose to jump out of the car was that before entering the political arena, he had once been a coach at an equestrian club where he had mastered horse riding skills. He believed that jumping out of the car would help him escape successfully.</p><p>However, his clothes were firmly grabbed by Zhu Tianlei, and the car was wildly crashing on the slightly steep road at an exaggerated speed. He could even smell the scent of death.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Yang Zhongmin with cold eyes but was equally terrified. He had not expected Yang Zhongmin to resort to desperate measures.</p><p>Despite his foot pressing firmly on the brake, the car showed no signs of stopping as if the brakes had failed.</p><p>Was Zhu Tianlei not afraid of death?</p><p>Of course, he was afraid. His parents, his beautiful wife, Tianlei Pharmaceutical, and all those unfulfilled wishes, including his promise to personally take Yang Zhongmin to apologize to Xiao Gang for him.</p><p>However, the car seemed like a raging monster, with sparks flying from the tires on the bumpy road. Yang Zhongmin's desperate struggle made the car shake even more violently.</p><p>"Ah, cliff!"</p><p>Yang Zhongmin suddenly screamed in panic. In front of the car was Hama Gou's famous 'death junction'—Dead End Cliff.</p><p>Yang Zhongmin was deputy county magistrate of Daye County and had previously worked at the traffic police station, making him very familiar with this death junction. He knew that below Dead End Cliff lay a deep valley over 200 meters deep. Not only would it be impossible for the car and people to fall down, but even birds trying to fly up from there would find it extremely difficult.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, Zhu Tianlei...... aren't you so awesome? Think of something fast!"</p><p>Yang Zhongmin's tears fell uncontrollably. In that moment, he suddenly placed his hope for survival on Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"There's no way out; let's die together!"</p><p>The car, carrying Yang Zhongmin's piercing screams as it pierced through the clouds, tumbled and plunged towards the cliff of doom.</p><p>The minivan trailing behind screeched to a halt. Yao Jianxiong ran down from the vehicle with a deathly pale face, frantically crawling to the spot where the Jeep had crashed.</p><p>In the misty fog, vision was blurred, except for the earth-shattering boom.</p><p>The birds in the forest were startled by the blast, fluttering wildly and panicking.</p><p>A few people who got out of their cars afterward stood behind Yao Jianxiong, their expressions varied.</p><p>"Heaven has eyes."</p><p>Among them, a man who had initially attacked Zhu Tianlei at Tien Lei Pharmaceutical sneered and spat out four words.</p><p>Yao Jianxiong turned around, his eyeballs bloodshot.</p><p>"Say it again!"</p><p>"I say that Zhu Tianlei got what he deserved. He died well and died quickly!"</p><p>The man was cold-blooded; not only in his words but also in his icy-cold gaze.</p><p>"You're looking for death!"</p><p>Yao Jianxiong, a genteel young man who never swore, lost all composure at this moment.</p><p>Looking out at the misty valley and thinking of the person who had once promoted him from an ordinary young man to the head of the materials department, now buried in the valley, his heart was pierced with unbearable pain.</p><p>He lunged towards the man.</p><p>Without any martial arts moves, he just wanted this disrespectful man to die.</p><p>Accompany Zhu Tianlei in his burial.</p><p>Although Yao Jianxiong is young and strong, he seems like a gold canary kept deep in the harem, lacking experience.</p><p>The two of them were entangled on the Cliff of Decapitation.</p><p>Chen Fanglin, standing beside the van, glanced at the Cliff of Decapitation with his puffy eyes, then at the two people fiercely fighting on the ground, before quietly leaving along a small path nearby.</p><p>The others exchanged glances but made no move.</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei had fallen off the cliff, he had already successfully sown seeds of fear in their hearts.</p><p>Even if he wasn't there, their fear did not dissipate.</p><p>A few minutes later, Yao Jianxiong slapped the man's face with a loud crack.</p><p>The fight was over.</p><p>"Alright, we're even now."</p><p>The man suddenly released Yao Jianxiong and said something inexplicable before standing up.</p><p>His eyes fixed on the Cliff of Decapitation, a strange emotion flickered across his gaze.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>This man moved like the wind, not giving Yao Jianxiong any time to react.</p><p>Yao Jianxiong knew that he could not stop these people.</p><p>Moreover, Zhu Tianlei is no longer here. What is the point of him blocking these people?</p><p>Yao Jianxiong, who will be twenty years old soon, stood at the edge of the cliff, facing the howling mountain wind, and for the first time in his life felt utterly lost.</p><p>However, before he could spread this feeling of confusion, he heard a horn blaring from nearby.</p><p>"Little brother, can you please move your car?"</p><p>The mountain road was very narrow. Two sedans trying to pass side by side required a degree of skill and bravery that not many people possessed.</p><p>Now, Yao Jianxiong's van was blocking the middle of the road, preventing any other vehicles from passing through.</p><p>Yao Jianxiong turned his head and saw a man in his thirties sticking his head out of the window of a black sedan.</p><p>His mind was a jumbled mess.</p><p>In this moment, he did not want to move; he just wanted to stand by the cliff's edge.</p><p>In reality, he harbored some hope.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, with his exceptional abilities and almost mythical presence, might still be alive.</p><p>Perhaps in the next second, he would climb up from the bottom of the cliff as before, pat him on the shoulder, and smile saying, 'Jianxiong, do your best!'</p>

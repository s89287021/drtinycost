						<p>The mother of Xiao Gangpeng had woken up, and within a day or so, the woman in her thirties looked as haggard as an old lady in her fifties.</p><p>Fortunately, her mood was much more stable than before. Upon seeing Zhu Tianlei, she nodded slightly, her gaze sweeping over Zhou Qiang and his group. Although she hated them, she did not make any out-of-control moves again.</p><p>"Mayor Yang, these are all the masterminds and accomplices involved in this matter. As I said earlier, Yang Zhongmin must pay a price, and so do these people."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke these words softly to Yang Wenjie's ear.</p><p>"Tianlei, I understand how you feel; I am also furious. But there are laws for the country and rules for the family. Besides, Yang Zhongmin is after all an official in the county. Perhaps you could... "</p><p>Yang Wenjie's voice was also low. To be honest, if it were not for political implications and internal regulations of the organization, Yang Wenjie would have wished to annihilate Yang Zhongmin completely. However, he had his own difficulties!</p><p>"Mayor Yang, I do not want to put you in a difficult position. I can hand these people over to Zhang Gu for handling, but... "</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's tone suddenly changed.</p><p>"I want them to kneel before Xiao Gangpeng and admit their mistakes with prostrations. Otherwise, I will never rest until they do!"</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei's voice was not loud, only Yang Wenjie could hear it. For some reason, including Yang Zhongmin in a group standing about seven or eight meters away all shuddered at once.</p><p>"W-Well... yes, they deserve this."</p><p>Yang Wenjie was about to say more but swallowed his words. He merely shook his head and sighed before patting Zhu Tianlei's shoulder twice, then walked over to Zhang Gu's side and whispered something into his ear.</p><p>Zhang Gu glanced at Zhu Tianlei out of the corner of his eye with a rather curious look in his eyes.</p><p>After instructing Zhang Gu, Yang Wenjie also had Deng Chang call out to Teng Kai. The few of them squeezed through the crowd and left.</p><p>Zhang Gu hesitated for a moment before leading over ten police officers out of the auditorium as well.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's eyes were slightly moistened. Of course, he knew why Yang Wenjie acted this way.</p><p>"Director Zhang...... Director Zhang, don't go......"</p><p>But he truly overestimated himself and underestimated others.</p><p>Seeing Zhang Gu leave, Yang Zhongmin knew that he was abandoned, no one cared about his life or death.</p><p>Pairs of eyes glared fiercely, as if they wished to peel his skin off and pull out his tendons, while Zhu Tianlei also had a gloomy expression and moved step by step closer.</p><p>"Sister, stand over here."</p><p>Although she was weak, Xiao Gangbeng's mother still walked over with the support of Yang Xiaoxue and Ma Lanlan when she heard Zhu Tianlei's words.</p><p>"Evil begets evil, good has a good ending. Today, I, Zhu Tianlei, will let everyone present experience these eight characters."</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei squatted down and gently adjusted Xiao Gangbeng's suspenders, then carefully put on the slightly slipping baby shoes, his movements gentle as flowing water.</p><p>"Kneel down!"</p><p>His voice was like an ice spike piercing through one's heart.</p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p>Yang Zhongmin thought that Zhu Tianlei would probably threaten him with silver needles or sharp blades, or perhaps even give him a good beating, but he never expected that Zhu Tianlei would ask him to kneel down.</p><p>"I said for you to kneel down and apologize to Xiao Gangbeng!"</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you are too arrogant. I, as the deputy county magistrate of Dahu County, you actually make me kneel in front of so many people to an infant corpse?"</p><p>"Do I ask you to kneel or not?"</p><p>Yang Zhongmin hadn't spoken yet, except for Zhou Qiang, the other gang members plopped down in a row, kneeling before Zhu Tianlei even had a chance to speak. Their heads hit the ground with a thud, and they started banging their foreheads on it relentlessly, seemingly determined not to stop until they bled.</p><p>"I, Yang Zhongmin, kneel only to heaven, earth, and ancestors; I will never kneel to anyone else."</p><p>"Very well!"</p><p>The moment he said "well," Zhu Tianlei lunged behind Yang Zhongmin. Before Yang could turn around, his knees ached sharply, and Zhu Tianlei kicked him in the calf, forcing Yang to kneel respectfully before Xiao Gang Bounced's corpse.</p><p>Facing Zhou Qiang, Zhu Tianlei didn't even acknowledge him with a greeting; he simply kicked him down, making Zhou kneel stiffly on the ground.</p><p>Zhou tried to stand up but was struck on his shoulder by someone, rendering him powerless.</p><p>"Bow your heads."</p><p>Although both Yang Zhongmin and Zhou Qiang were kneeling out of necessity, they kept their necks straight, refusing to bow.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei curled his lips into a sneer as he flicked his wrist. Silver needles pierced their skulls almost simultaneously, causing intense pain that felt like being immersed in hot oil. The agony was unbearable.</p><p>"I'll bow... I'll bow..."</p><p>Yang Zhongmin's last vestiges of pride and resistance crumbled away. Like the other gang members, he started banging his head on Xiao Gang Bounced's corpse.</p><p>"You don't have to bow, but Tang Qingshuan won't survive in prison if you don't. Do you believe me?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's voice sounded like it came from hell.</p><p>Tang Qingshuan was Zhou Qiang's weak spot.</p><p>The last stubborn one finally lowered his head, his forehead touching the ground as continuous thuds of bowing echoed around.</p><p>Nine people, ranging from a county chief to street thugs, knelt before a five-year-old child's corpse, begging for mercy.</p><p>The just verdict brought great satisfaction, and in the hall, people who hadn't even had time to eat from morning till night roared with joy like a landslide.</p><p>Xiao Gangbang's mother burst into tears at that moment. She broke free from Yang Xiaoxue and Zhang Yuntao and fell to her knees before Zhu Tianlei with a thud.</p><p>No one saw that Xiao Gangbang, whose eyes had been slightly open, slowly closed them.</p><p>Outside the company on a small road, Yang Wenjie and Deng Chang sat in the car, listening to the cheers coming from the hall, their faces showing different emotions.</p><p>Half an hour later, Zhang Gu led his men, handcuffing Yang Zhongmin and several others, out of Tianlei Pharmaceutical's grand hall.</p><p>As he passed by Zhu Tianlei, Zhang Gu thought for a moment but didn't say anything.</p><p>He wasn't as arrogant and stubborn as his teacher Sun Jianguo. After today, he had thoroughly realized that he was not Zhu Tianlei's match. If he wanted to stay safely in his current position, then he shouldn't provoke the other side.</p><p>"Big sister, if you don't mind, you can bury Xiao Gangbang on the small mountain behind Tianlei Pharmaceutical. Xiao Gangbang loved climbing mountains. Although it's not very high, it overlooks Big Green Mountain. I think Xiao Gangbang would have liked it there."</p><p>Xiao Gangbang's mother nodded almost without thinking.</p><p>"He used to tell me every day after he came out of the quarantine zone how kind the big brothers in the quarantine zone were to him and said that when he grew up, he wanted to be like them. Now he doesn't have that chance anymore, but being able to see you every day, I think he would have been happy."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's eyes welled up with tears, several women also had tearful eyes, and most of the people around them wiped their tears and cried out loud.</p><p>That night, Tianlei Pharmaceutical did not sleep.</p><p>That night, the villagers in Hama Gou felt a deep sorrow.</p><p>The sudden loss of a young life seemed to cast a shadow over the small village that was already approaching New Year's Eve.</p>

						<p>Zhu Tianlei's voice fell, and several people all simultaneously widened their eyes.</p><p>"Did you peddle fake medicine?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shook his head.</p><p>"Did you accept bribes from patients?"</p><p>......</p><p>"I understand, you got into trouble for messing with the doctor-patient relationship......"</p><p>......</p><p>Several people surrounded Zhu Tianlei, making wild guesses, but no matter what they guessed, it seemed unreasonable that a doctor, who hadn't committed murder or arson, would end up in 309.</p><p>"Don't guess anymore, I'll put it simply: I won't be staying long!"</p><p>After saying this, Zhu Tianlei leaned against the headboard of the bed.</p><p>Soon, the two people working outside were also brought back. The quick-talking Ruan Liang hurriedly introduced Zhu Tianlei to them and didn't forget to add numerous embellishments to the description of Zhu Tianlei's duel with Yan Datou.</p><p>Yan Datou was not annoyed at all; he kept smiling as he watched the group talk. Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but take another look at Yan Datou in admiration.</p><p>"Big brother is impressive, my name is Pang Bo, and this is my brother Pang Liang."</p><p>It turned out to be a pair of brothers.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei wasn't much of a talker, and although he didn't look down on these people, he felt that they were not on the same wavelength as him. Less interaction might be for the better, so in response to their enthusiasm, he only gave brief answers.</p><p>Soon, it was time for lunch.</p><p>Because all the inmates in Cell 309 were repeat offenders, they had a separate cafeteria, which was an independent room with four or five tables inside. Zhu Tianlei glanced at the food on his plate: shredded potatoes, stir-fried Chinese cabbage, and a dish of braised chicken thighs with eggplant. "Damn, today's meal is pretty good!" Ruan Liang was always talkative; basically, he didn't stop talking for most of the morning. Zhu Tianlei raised his chopsticks, thought for a moment, but ultimately put them down. It wasn't that he had a picky palate; it was just that he had no appetite. "Tianlei, aren't you eating?" "I'm not hungry. If you're not disgusted by it, go ahead and eat it!" Liu Zi was very sturdy. He had already finished his food and was licking his lips, staring at Zhu Tianlei the whole time. As the mealtime was coming to an end and Zhu Tianlei still hadn't touched his food, Liu Zi couldn't help but ask, "Isn't that bad..." Although Liu Zi said this, he automatically grabbed Zhu Tianlei's plate and quickly finished everything on it in three bites. "Burp!" Liu Zi was satisfied with his meal, patting his stomach and laughing like a child. Zhu Tianlei found it strange; Liu Zi didn't seem to have all his wits about him, but his heart wasn't bad. Would someone like this really kill people? "Are you curious why Liu Zi is here?" Yan Datou noticed the look on Zhu Tianlei's face.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>"Sigh, why not? Just for a steamed bun."</p><p>Yan Datou sighed, his eyes full of pity.</p><p>"Just for a steamed bun?"</p><p>"Indeed. Liu Zi's mother passed away when he was young. When he turned six or seven, his father found him a stepmother. At first, the stepmother treated Liu Zi okay—she provided food and drink—but as time went on, her true nature revealed itself. When Liu Zi's father was around, she fed him, but if he left home, Liu Zi had to go hungry."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei knew what Yan Datou was talking about; Liu Xing from the same village was that stepmother. However, Liu Xing's father protected his child. Once, he noticed red marks on Liu Xing's arm where someone had pinched him, and after finding out it was his own second wife who did it, he chased her away and raised Liu Xing himself, never taking another wife.</p><p>"Didn't Liu Zi's father know?"</p><p>"He was an alcoholic; he was drunk for most of the day. That year, when Liu Zi turned nineteen, his father died of liver cancer, and that stepmother kicked him out. With nowhere to go, Liu Zi had to scavenge and beg for food from place to place. Who would have thought two ruthless street thugs would notice him? They saw that he wasn't fully mentally capable and used food as bait, getting him to steal for them."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned, imagining the scene vividly.</p><p>"That night, those two street thugs told Liu Zi they would give him all the white steamed buns he wanted if he stole a safe from someone's house. Unfortunately, right after he entered the door, he found a woman on the floor in the living room, covered in blood. He tried to help her, but as soon as he turned her over, the police came in. Liu Zi..."</p><p>Thinking about how ravenously Liu Zi ate and his innocent, childlike smile while eating made Zhu Tianlei feel uneasy.</p><p>But this world was such that right and wrong were not always clear-cut.</p><p>According to regulations, there was one hour for lunch break. Zhu Tianlei lay on the hard wooden bed, thinking about Liu Zi's plight, feeling sympathetic.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Suddenly, Ren Liang, who was lying beside Zhu Tianlei, groaned and rushed to the bathroom quickly.</p><p>Before Zhu Tianlei could react, the others also started clutching their stomachs and moaning. Yan Datou began to speak but suddenly bent over, vomiting a large amount of sour food—what they had eaten for lunch.</p><p>Half an hour had passed, and the bathroom door had never been closed. The room was filled with a strange, nauseating smell.</p><p>The only ones who showed no reaction were Zhu Tianlei and Liuzi.</p><p>When Yan Datou, exhausted from diarrhea, lay on the bed moaning, Zhu Tianlei placed his hand on Yan Datou's wrist.</p><p>Food poisoning.</p><p>He then took the pulses of Ran Liang and a few others, and the results were the same: food poisoning.</p><p>But why didn't Liuzi react, even though he ate more than anyone else?</p><p>"Brother Yan, have you guys experienced this before?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pulled out several Baiqing pills from his pocket and made everyone take them. Fortunately, the bailiffs hadn't searched him when they brought him in; otherwise, these people might have suffered for a much longer time.</p><p>After taking the Baiqing pills, the condition of the group strangely improved, and their admiration for Zhu Tianlei became even more genuine.</p><p>"We have experienced it before. Guys, our stomachs are relatively strong. Before coming here, we ate fresh seafood every day without getting sick, but since we came in, eating vegetables has also caused diarrhea. I reckon it's because our stomachs got used to being spoiled by big fish and meat!"</p><p>Although Yan Datou's stomach didn't hurt as much anymore, he still spoke with a weak voice.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned.</p><p>Yan Datou was optimistic, but the facts were absolutely not so simple.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei jumped off the bed and walked to the trash can beside the door, squatting down.</p><p>"Hey, Brother Tianlei, what are you doing?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei using his fingers to dig through their vomit, Yan Datou screamed in surprise.</p><p>"Indeed so!" Zhu Tianlei sneered. Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, several people were at a loss, unable to comprehend the meaning of his statement. Indeed so, indeed what?</p>

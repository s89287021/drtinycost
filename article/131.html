						<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, please follow me to the materials warehouse."</p><p>This time, Zhu Tianlei's words were like an imperial decree. Although these people did not speak up, their interest had already peaked; they all wanted to see what new tricks Zhu Tianlei would pull out.</p><p>At this moment, Mu Kun did not have a position to refuse; refusing meant admitting Zhu Tianlei's conjecture that he was framing him.</p><p>The materials warehouse was about the same size as the storage room. As soon as one entered, a strong scent of medicine greeted them. Inside were three rows of medicine racks, each rack holding one transparent vacuum box after another. The medicinal herbs inside the boxes were clearly visible.</p><p>A wild lingzhi as large as a basin caught everyone's attention. For those who dealt with medicines all year round, this lingzhi was enough to make people exclaim at the miracle.</p><p>However, at present, their focus on how events would develop had surpassed their curiosity and excitement about this thousand-year-old lingzhi. Everyone was eagerly waiting for Zhu Tianlei's next move.</p><p>"Comrade, may I ask where did you find the opium poppy shells in your hand?"</p><p>The small-enforcement officer was already quite bewildered; this was an unexpected situation, and Inspector Mu had not mentioned it before. What should he do?</p><p>He instinctively glanced at Mu Kun, whose gaze was like a knife, ruthless but showing no intention of indicating what he should do.</p><p>"What, has Comrade forgotten where he found them?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pressed hard, leaving the other person no time to breathe or think. Under everyone's watchful eyes, the officer's back was soaked with sweat; he gritted his teeth and randomly pointed to a place.</p><p>"Oh, it's right here. Which of you is in the business of traditional Chinese medicine? Please lend me a hand!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the onlookers and asked. Soon, a man in his fifties stepped forward, short but sharp-witted, clearly an astute person.</p><p>"Mr. Zhu, I started my career dealing with medicinal herbs."</p><p>"Great, then you should have a very sensitive nose for medicines, right?"</p><p>"Absolutely. Without a good nose, one can't do the business of medicinal herbs. We distinguish the age and purity of the herbs based on their smell."</p><p>The old man was very proud and couldn't help but advertise himself. Zhu Tianlei smiled, that was exactly the effect he wanted.</p><p>"That's troublesome, could you please smell this place?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't specify what to smell, but the old man cooperated fully, walking directly to where the officer had pointed out, wrinkling his nose and sniffing for nearly half a minute.</p><p>"There is a strong medicinal scent here; it stored cinnamon twig and astragalus before."</p><p>"You are truly remarkable, no wonder you're an expert in traditional Chinese medicine. I admire you!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was not stingy with praise, making the old man feel very honored, his heart blooming with joy.</p><p>"Oh no, Master Zhu is flattering me, hahaha......"</p><p>"This officer, you got the location wrong!"</p><p>The officer who was called out again had already felt his legs go weak, but seeing Mu Kun's murderous glare, he resisted the urge to run away and pointed to another place again.</p><p>......</p><p>"This area stored forsythia and gastrodia."</p><p>......</p><p>"This area stored fire hemp seed and galanga."</p><p>......</p><p>......</p><p>The old man was exceptionally skilled, and Zhu Tianlei genuinely admired him. He had not made a single mistake with dozens of medicinal herbs, relying solely on his sense of smell.</p><p>At this point, the enforcer was thoroughly at a loss for words. He regretted it deeply, regretting that he had impulsively joined Mu Kun’s criminal gang. He had worked hard to climb from a clerk in the county government to an official at the city’s drug administration, and now his seat hadn’t even warmed up yet!</p><p>"Officer Mu, it seems your subordinate has rather poor memory. Let me prescribe him some medicine to adjust it; he’s still young and it’ll be difficult for him to find a wife later on!"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei grin widely with genuine sincerity, Mu Kun was furious.</p><p>What could have gone wrong? Zhu Tianlei had clearly been well-prepared; how was this possible? He couldn’t make sense of it.</p><p>"Old man, could you please smell this comrade’s clothes? Opium shells are not a good thing; sniffing too much can have side effects on people."</p><p>Seeing the old man approaching him, the enforcer nearly fell to the ground with fear.</p><p>At that moment, Mu Kun, who had been frowning all along, finally spoke up.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, these items were all seized from your warehouse and raw material storage. Everyone saw it happen with their own eyes. When we entered, we only brought monitoring instruments; we didn’t bring anything else. Relying on such insufficient evidence to clear yourself is unlikely to work."</p><p>Compared to the young enforcer, Mu Kun, this old fox, was clearly more seasoned. He was right that these alone couldn’t completely clear one’s suspicion.</p><p>"Officer Mu says so, but isn’t Officer Mu curious about why I know all this?"</p><p>One sentence immediately tensed up Mu Kun’s nerves; this was precisely the question he couldn’t solve. However, at this juncture, he absolutely could not admit it.</p><p>"I don’t understand what you’re saying. If you continue with these absurd claims, we have no time to entertain you further. The seizure operation will continue!"</p><p>"Officer Mu, don’t be in such a hurry; I have someone I’d like Officer Mu to meet."</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei clapped his hands twice. Soon after, the crowd parted, and a person slowly walked out. Mu Kun’s heart sank to the bottom, freezing over.</p><p>"Officer Mu, do you recognize this person?"</p><p>Mu Kun's hands were already turning a purplish-blue. How could this happen? How could this happen?</p><p>"I don't know him."</p><p>It took Mu Kun biting his tongue several times before he managed to utter these five words.</p><p>"Brother Meng, you can't blame me. I gave you the opportunity, but you clearly overestimated yourself. Jian Xiong, take Brother Meng to turn himself in!"</p><p>The person called Brother Meng's face changed.</p><p>"Mu Kun, you damn brat, I risked my life for you. You're crossing the river and cutting the bridge behind you. You actually say you don't recognize me? Fine, if you refuse to acknowledge me, don't blame me for being unrighteous. You gave me 100,000 yuan to infiltrate Tian Lei Pharmaceutical as a spy, to put medicine laced with prohibited substances into the warehouse. You..."</p><p>"Shut up! I didn't recognize you at all. Zhu Tian Lei, do you think pulling in a madman will clear your name? Hmph, the net is wide and open; I Mu Kun absolutely cannot tolerate such unscrupulous merchants as you. Since you forcefully interfere with judicial fairness, don't blame me for using forceful means!"</p><p>Mu Kun was driven to desperation, akin to a dog jumping over walls in fear. He never thought that Meng Zhong, who had followed him for nearly eight years, would not even trust him this much and turned him in. He couldn't let Meng Zhong continue speaking, but at the moment, stirring up trouble seemed like his only option.</p><p>"You all come at me!"</p><p>Zhu Tian Lei raised an eyebrow with a smile. This was going to turn into a full-blown fight. Hadn't Mu Kun done his homework and known about his capabilities?</p><p>When the onlookers saw that the other party was actually going to take action, they immediately scattered to the sides. What were they doing here for money if not for their lives?</p>

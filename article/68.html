						<p>Zhu Tianlei opened the car door and hadn't even had time to get a clear look at the driver's face when the car shot forward with a whoosh.</p><p>"Shit!"</p><p>Unprepared, Zhu Tianlei lurched forward, nearly hitting his head on the windshield.</p><p>"Hey, Miss Mao, how are you driving?"</p><p>Once he sat up straight, Zhu Tianlei turned to look at the person in the driver's seat and almost stumbled over his words upon seeing them.</p><p>Is it a man?</p><p>The man in the driver's seat was very handsome, with fair skin that seemed to glow, bright black eyes, and an attractive appearance, though somewhat overly effeminate.</p><p>"Cough cough, sorry, I got you wrong!"</p><p>The other person gave Zhu Tianlei a cold glance, exuding such authority that Zhu Tianlei felt immense pressure.</p><p>"I am Mao Yu!"</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei almost spat out his heart.</p><p>What's going on?</p><p>Someone who speaks in a sissified tone is actually a man?</p><p>That can't be right?</p><p>"Uh... are you a guy?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt it necessary to clarify this issue. Dealing with women was entirely different from dealing with men.</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, the car suddenly accelerated, and he was thrown forward again. Fortunately, with experience from before, Zhu Tianlei grabbed onto the handle by the passenger seat and didn't get tossed out of the car.</p><p>"What are you trying to rob me for?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was also upset; he was just asking a question, after all.</p><p>However, this time, even without the other person's response, Zhu Tianlei had an answer in mind. In this world, apart from scoundrels, only women could be so vengeful!</p><p>"I don't like talkative men!"</p><p>Mao Yu looked at the road ahead without expression and said coldly.</p><p>"You... "</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was stunned by her retort.</p><p>Humph, I won't stoop to a woman's level!</p><p>Suppressing his anger, Zhu Tianlei sat quietly in the passenger seat, closed his eyes, and really didn't speak.</p><p>On the other hand, Mao Yu was surprised that Zhu Tianlei was so cooperative. She indeed did not like men who were overly talkative and glib.</p><p>The car drove quickly and smoothly. After about an hour, it stopped at the entrance of Yunhai City's Administration Building.</p><p>"Get out. Do whatever I tell you to do!"</p><p>Mao Yu knew Zhu Tianlei hadn't fallen asleep, so she said directly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was still seething with anger throughout the trip and didn't want to talk to Mao Yu. He opened the car door and got out without a word, making Mao Yu frown slightly.</p><p>If this matter had not been personally requested by President Min over the phone, she would not have come. She was a business genius on Wall Street in America, yet she had to accompany a noisy man to handle the procedures for opening a factory.</p><p>In America, she worked as a consultant for the company, earning $5,000 per hour.</p><p>Now, with no money and having to put up with the other person's attitude, Mao Yu was quite frustrated.</p><p>The two, both seething with anger, entered the door of the approval hall one after another.</p><p>"ID and household registration book!" </p><p>After entering, Mao Yu stretched out her hand.</p><p>Even though Zhu Tianlei was unhappy, he knew this was a matter at hand and therefore handed over his documents to Mao Yu very cooperatively.</p><p>Mao Yu's expression then softened slightly.</p><p>"You go queue up for a number first. We'll meet here later!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded. Fortunately, they had arrived early, and it didn't take long before Zhu Tianlei was called. He returned with the number, only to find that Mao Yu had also returned with several forms.</p><p>"Fill out all these forms. If you encounter anything you're unsure about, leave them blank."</p><p>Mao Yu always spoke succinctly, hardly ever wasting a word. To her, language was meant for solving problems, not wasting time.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had somewhat adapted to Mao Yu's working style and took the forms to sit on a nearby chair.</p><p>There were a total of seven forms, mainly application forms and basic information registration forms. When filling out the company registration name field, Zhu Tianlei hesitated for a moment.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>Mao Yu noticed that Zhu Tianlei had suddenly stopped writing and remained still for a while before asking.</p><p>"I was wondering what name the company should have!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said this in a straightforward manner, without any emotion, just a plain statement.</p><p>"Tianlei Pharmaceutical."</p><p>Mao Yu blurted out without any hesitation.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei raised his eyes; wasn't this name too casual?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's eyes widened. Was his own name that good?</p><p>However, he knew that what Mao Yu said must be true, and moreover, the person assigned by Min Shengjun couldn't be wrong. Furthermore, the four characters of Tianlei Pharmaceutical resonated deeply with him.</p><p>Soon, several forms were filled out. Mao Yu took them over for a check, adding some details that Zhu Tianlei had left blank, and then led Zhu Tianlei to the audit area.</p><p>A male clerk in his late twenties did not even lift his head as he spoke from behind the counter.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei handed over all the documents. Mao Yu also took out an ID card and its copy from his wallet. Zhu Tianlei glanced at them and found it was Min Shengjun's.</p><p>"The registration capital needs three million yuan, do you know about that?"</p><p>The clerk looked up after seeing Zhu Tianlei's ID card and household registration book information, looking directly at him with a clear hint of disdain in his eyes.</p><p>A twenty-one-year-old young man from a famous poverty-stricken village; it was normal for the clerk to think that Zhu Tianlei couldn't come up with such an amount. However, his gaze made Zhu Tianlei feel extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>He really didn't know that registering a company would require so much money. What should he do?</p><p>"I was wondering what name the company should have!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said this in a straightforward manner, without any emotion, just a plain statement.</p><p>"Tianlei Pharmaceutical."</p><p>Mao Yu blurted out without any hesitation.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei raised his eyes; wasn't this name too casual?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's eyes widened.

However, his gaze made Zhu Tianlei feel extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>He really didn't know that registering a company would require so much money. What should he do?</p><p>"If you don't have the money, go prepare it first. Wait until you have enough to proceed with the formalities. Remember, it needs to be three million; otherwise, the capital verification won't pass, and that will be troublesome!"</p><p>After saying this, the clerk threw the application form and documents back onto the table outside the counter.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face turned red instantly.</p><p>"Didn't you prepare the money for the capital verification?"</p><p>Mao Yu was surprised that Zhu Tianlei, who had applied to register a pharmaceutical factory, hadn't even prepared the money for the capital verification. Why did Manager Min assign her to come here?</p><p>Seeing Mao Yu's puzzled look, Zhu Tianlei felt as if his dignity was being fried in a hot oil pot.</p><p>At this moment, a young woman walked out from behind the counter, with an obviously pregnant belly, looking like she was about to give birth at any moment.</p><p>The woman was very frail, but her belly was unusually large. When she stood next to the counter, she smiled at Zhu Tianlei, and her smile was gentle.</p><p>However, Zhu Tianlei wasn't in the mood and simply nodded politely before preparing to take his documents and leave.</p><p>"Meng, why are you here?"</p><p>The clerk's face changed immediately upon seeing the woman outside the counter. There was no hint of malice; instead, there was concern all over her face.</p><p>"Ah Qiang, I feel a bit unwell in my stomach. I couldn't reach you by phone, so I came to look for you!"</p>

						<p>Zhu Tianlei used a small porcelain bowl he had prepared in advance to take half a bowl of blood, then pushed Tang Huangshan to the side of Yao Jianxiong. He walked straight toward the main house. Just as he reached the door, Liu Meixiang opened it from inside.</p><p>"Auntie, have you prepared everything I asked for?"</p><p>Liu Meixiang nodded her head. Concerning her husband's safety, she dared not be the slightest bit careless. As she followed Zhu Tianlei into the house, she glanced at Tang Huangshan in the courtyard.</p><p>Inside the house, Zhu Tianlei put several items such as realgar, mountain vinegar, and nitrate into the small bowl according to the required proportions.</p><p>"Auntie, help lift the village chief up. Whatever you see later, Auntie must support him; don't let go!"</p><p>Liu Meixiang's heart trembled. Despite her fear, she responded with a yes, then lifted Yao Gang up and made him lean against her.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took out silver needles, now having three needle pricks at his own acupuncture points, and then proceeded to insert seven or eight more silver needles into the key acupuncture points on Yao Gang's body. He then pinched Yao Gang's mouth shut and forced a mixture of drugs with fresh blood into him.</p><p>The smell of blood filled the room, making Liu Meixiang feel queasy. However, fearing it would affect Zhu Tianlei, she swallowed what had risen to her throat.</p><p>After a moment, Yao Gang's body twitched slightly, followed by his limbs convulsing. Zhu Tianlei lifted his hand that had previously been pricked, pinching the wrist artery. An unusual thing happened.</p><p>Under Yao Gang's arm, a faint red line began to appear and moved swiftly. Zhu Tianlei picked up a silver needle and chased after this red line as if herding sheep, with the needle falling wherever the line went.</p><p>Soon, the moving red line started to take a haphazard route toward the location of the pricks.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Liu Meixiang could no longer hold it in. Upon seeing the blood line shooting up from her husband's palm, she screamed.</p><p>However, before she could recover, as her gaze fell upon the spurting blood line, she was terrified again to the point of shivering. What she saw was not blood but a coiling and writhing worm over one meter long.</p><p>This was far from it. Zhu Tianlei repeated the process, and three minutes later, another worm emerged from the pricks, followed by a third, fourth, fifth...</p><p>Seven in total.</p><p>Liu Meixiang was already sobbing uncontrollably, thinking about the suffering her husband had endured. "Auntie, go fetch some sugary water for the village chief; he'll wake up within five minutes at most." Liu Meixiang wiped her tears and rushed off the bed to find brown sugar and boil water. Zhu Tianlei took advantage of this time to tidy up the seven leeches, which had become worthless except for scaring people. When Liu Meixiang brought in the sugary water, Yao Gang's eyelids twitched, and he woke up. "Tianlei?" Yao Gang opened his eyes, unsure if he was dreaming and asked hesitantly. "Uncle Jianxiong, you're awake! We were so scared!" Hearing Yao Gang's voice, Liu Meixiang started crying again. "What... happened?" Yao Gang was confused, not knowing why his wife was crying or how Zhu Tianlei had ended up in their home. As she sobbed, Liu Meixiang briefly recounted the events that had transpired, and Yao Gang frowned repeatedly. "Tianlei, you've saved Uncle once more; I truly..." Thinking about how Zhu Tianlei had saved him yet again made Yao Gang's mood indeterminate, but his expression darkened even further when he learned he had been cursed by a leech. Seeing Yao Gang's expression, Zhu Tianlei began to suspect there was more to the story. "Village chief, do you know Tang Qingshan?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei used an affirmative sentence, and he mentioned Tang Qingshan instead of Tang Huangshan.</p><p>Yao Gang first opened his mouth in astonishment and then shook his head. Zhu Tianlei had experienced his intelligence; there were some things that couldn't be hidden, especially since Zhu Tianlei had twice saved his life!</p><p>"I originally didn't have the surname Yao, I have the surname Tang!"</p><p>The first sentence Yao Gang said shocked Zhu Tianlei very much. Yao Gang actually had the surname Tang—what was going on?</p><p>"The Tang Qingshan you mentioned is the patriarch of the Tang family. I am the sixth in line."</p><p>"Are you and Tang Qingshan brothers?"</p><p>"No, we are cousins."</p><p>Even though they were not from the same parents, in terms of blood relation, they were still extremely close.</p><p>That year, Yao Gang was thirteen. Because of begging, he ended up at Yao Shan's doorstep. Yao Shan and his wife had no children and saw that Yao Gang had a good appearance and was an orphan, so they hired a matchmaker to adopt him as their foster son. A few years ago, the old couple passed away one after another.</p><p>"I didn't expect these people to find me here after thirty years."</p><p>Yao Gang sighed; since the poison just lifted, his complexion was still very pale and emaciated.</p><p>"Villager Chief, if this is your family matter, I won't intervene. You handle it as you see fit."</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei tidied up his things and prepared to leave.</p><p>"Tianlei, you... don't you believe Uncle?"</p><p>"The Village Chief leads the entire village, no one would doubt what you say. You are overthinking!"</p><p>Watching Zhu Tianlei about to leave, Liu Meixiang panicked.</p><p>"Father Jianxiong, it's this time of the day, what are you still hiding? If you don't say now, someone will eventually plot against your life."</p><p>Yao Gang glared at Liu Meixiang but ultimately sighed.</p><p>"Tianlei, Uncle also has his reasons. It's not that Uncle won't speak up; it's really......"</p><p>"It's the village chief's freedom to decide whether or not to speak. It's getting late, I'll go back first!"</p><p>Saying this, Zhu Tianlei left without a backward glance. Yao Jianxiong, still holding Tang Huangshan, was standing in the courtyard. Seeing Zhu Tianlei come out, he was just about to open his mouth when Zhu Tianlei swept through the courtyard like the wind and directly walked out the gate.</p><p>Outside the door of Yao's family, Zhu Tianlei finally frowned; he was indeed somewhat irritated.</p><p>Yao Gang clearly had something hidden, and this matter was definitely not simple. The other party clearly did not want his life; in such cases, it must be for a purpose that they would say so.</p><p>But what for?</p><p>Even if Yao Gang really was the designated successor of the Tang family, that was decades ago. There wasn't much to gain from Yao Gang, except for the position of village chief.</p><p>If that's the case, then it would certainly be related to Hama Gou. The previous acquisition of land by Shengshi Group was a prime example.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt irritated and arrived home in the middle of the night. Without washing his face, he lay on the bed exhausted and fell into a drowsy sleep.</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>"Big Brother Lei, it's bad news! Dad is going to die!"</p><p>Before Zhu Tianlei even opened his eyes, he heard Yao Jianxiong's voice.</p>

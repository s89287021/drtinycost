						<p>Yang Xiaoxue, although not as detailed in her understanding of the illnesses as Ma Lanlan, had learned about the severity of the situation from the villagers' discussions.</p><p>Previously, whether it was his own food poisoning or an elderly person suddenly falling ill and fainting, Zhu Tianlei had effortlessly cured them. However, now that three days had passed with no improvement, and the number of sick people only increasing, if Zhu Tianlei truly had a solution, he likely wouldn't have allowed things to reach this point.</p><p>"I have an 80% chance of success!"</p><p>In fact, Zhu Tianlei was certain he could cure those who were ill. However, he said it was an 80% chance because there was a mystery in his mind that he didn't want to reveal yet.</p><p>An 80% chance!</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue sighed in relief; an 80% chance was already quite impressive.</p><p>As they spoke, the two of them headed towards Yang Xiaoxue's residence.</p><p>Thinking it was for teaching in Hama Gou, Yang Xiaoxue's residence had been provided by the village, a two-courtyard small compound behind the village committee building.</p><p>"Alright, Tianlei, go back home!"</p><p>At the gate, Yang Xiaoxue turned to Zhu Tianlei and said, with cold moonlight casting silver powder over her body.</p><p>"Here!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pointed at his face and stretched his neck, nearly pressing his face against hers.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue's cheeks flushed red. She glanced around, then tiptoed, moving her lips slightly before quickly kissing Zhu Tianlei's cheek and pushing open the door to rush into the courtyard.</p><p>The blushing Yang Xiaoxue, leaning against the courtyard wall, looked up at the silver moon in the night sky and the twinkling stars, a smile spreading across her lips like a delicate rose.</p><p>As for Zhu Tianlei, after seeing Yang Xiaoxue off and preparing to return to the clinic, he suddenly noticed a dark figure sprinting from the village entrance, disappearing into the darkness in an instant.</p><p>Who could this person be at midnight?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei wanted to follow along, but thinking of Ma Lanlan left alone at the clinic, he gave up on the idea and went straight back to the clinic.</p><p>Since Zhu Tianlei’s antidote pills included Hu Xinzi as one of the ingredients, after returning to the clinic, they had to work hard for half a day to blend all the herbs in proportion.</p><p>The eastern sky was already turning fishbelly white.</p><p>Looking at Ma Lanlan’s slightly weary sleeping face on the table, Zhu Tianlei felt a pang of heartache and pulled his coat over her. He himself, however, could not fall asleep.</p><p>That cluster of white worms constantly wriggling in the stream kept appearing like nightmares in his mind.</p><p>......</p><p>"Tiger, Tiger!"</p><p>Before seven o'clock, Ma Lanlan woke up. They exchanged simple words before heading to Auntie Liu’s house immediately with the pills they had made overnight.</p><p>Not long after feeding the pills to Tiger, he moved his small hand, then his eyelids trembled slightly, and his amber eyes opened.</p><p>Auntie Liu was excited and babbling incoherently, while Tiger’s mother cried out loud with joy.</p><p>"Grandma, I want eggs!"</p><p>"Okay, okay, Grandma will make eggs for Tiger!"</p><p>The child had not eaten anything for three or four days and said he wanted eggs the first thing upon waking up, making Ma Lanlan’s eyes well up with sorrow.</p><p>"Tiger, quickly bow to Uncle. If it weren’t for Uncle, you would have been taken by the little demon."</p><p>Tiger’s father was a very quiet man who had not spoken much during previous visits for treatment. Now that his son was awake, it seemed as if he had also saved his life.</p><p>"Yes yes yes, quickly bow to your benefactor!"</p><p>Hearing her son's words, Auntie Liu also urged him repeatedly.</p><p>"Auntie Liu, Big Brother, Huizi has just woken up and his body is still weak. Besides, I have watched Huizi grow up, so how can I stand idly by? This is what I should do. If you keep this up, I won't dare to visit next time!"</p><p>Seeing Huizi wake up, Zhu Tianlei was also overjoyed. He had saved not only Huizi's life but also a family.</p><p>"Tianlei, you are really amazing!"</p><p>After leaving Auntie Liu's house, Ma Lanlan suddenly said seriously to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"I never thought I would become a doctor one day. And I certainly didn't think that after becoming a doctor, not only could I treat people and save lives, but I could also bring new life and hope to a family."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said it very seriously as well. This was what he truly felt. Initially, he just wanted to use his medical skills to earn money and let his parents live a good life and change his own fate. He had never thought about more.</p><p>The second household they visited was that of the village's welfare recipient, Rong Yishan. Compared to other patients, Rong Yishan's condition was relatively mild, so he woke up as soon as he took the medicine.</p><p>"Leizi, I owe my life to you, cough cough..."</p><p>"Uncle, don't get too excited; drink some water first!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei picked up a teacup from the table. He didn't expect Rong Yishan to spit out the cup directly when he saw it.</p><p>"Leizi, this water can't be drunk; I got sick after drinking this water!"</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Furthermore, with so many people present, none could articulate the reason for falling ill, how did Rong Yishan come to definitively conclude that the issue lay with the water?</p><p>"Uncle, how do you know it's because of this water?"</p><p>Rong Yishan glared at the teacup before him and then slowly spoke.</p><p>"That day I went out to work in the fields, got up early without eating anything, and didn't get back until around three o'clock. I scooped a cup of water from the barrel; I hadn't checked it before drinking several gulps. But just as I was about to drink more, I noticed there were bugs in the teacup."</p><p>Bugs?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei quickly examined the teacup. Without close inspection, there seemed to be nothing in the water, but since Zhu Tianlei had seen the bugs in the water before, upon closer look, he did indeed spot a few delicate white threads of bugs.</p><p>"Lanlan, go check the water barrel!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan was also aware of the severity of the situation and rushed out with Zhu Tianlei to the water barrel in the outer room. Inside the barrel, white worms swam freely in the water; these were even larger than those Zhu Tianlei had seen previously in the Little Black Stream.</p><p>"Yuck!"</p><p>Thinking about possibly ingesting such bugs, Ma Lanlan felt nauseated and vomited violently.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hurriedly gave Ma Lanlan some acupressure to stabilize her condition, but he could do nothing to alleviate the nausea in his own mind.</p><p>"Tianlei, what's going on here?"</p>

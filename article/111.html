						<p>"Hmph, brothers, don't listen to this punk's boasting. Get him! I want to see if he dares to kill me. Everyone, get moving!"</p><p>Tang Qingshan made his decision, and his voice became firm.</p><p>Everyone glanced at Tang Qingshan; since their lives were in the other person's hands and that person didn't care, why should they? After all, each of them would get ten thousand yuan after it was over. They wouldn't let such an opportunity go!</p><p>The chaos erupted again.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't expect Tang Qingshan to be so bold; simply throwing him down wouldn't solve the problem. Therefore, in a desperate moment, he single-handedly lifted Tang Qingshan and teleported instantly, reaching the two people at the front in the blink of an eye. As soon as his hand moved, both men screamed "Ah" and fell to the ground in agony.</p><p>Following Zhu Tianlei's second move, within just a few dozen seconds, more than ten people lost their combat ability, groaning on the ground.</p><p>However, the number of people was simply too large. Despite Zhu Tianlei's swift movements, some still managed to squeeze past his body and rush into the protective barrier.</p><p>Moreover, they didn't only target the building; they even attacked the workers.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's eyes nearly popped out of his head. With a movement of both hands, he threw Tang Qingshan flat, freeing his hands to move like a dragon diving into water. Wherever he went, people stumbled and fell, screams echoing continuously.</p><p>The workers standing at a higher ground stared in disbelief at Zhu Tianlei, seemingly assisted by divine powers. Each one was so surprised that they forgot about their own peril. Was this person even human? Or was he a god?</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Something suddenly fell from Zhu Tianlei's body, making a crisp sound.</p><p>What landed on the ground was a copper plaque engraved with an eagle spreading its wings to fly.</p><p>"Token of the Black Eagle Gang?"</p><p>A voice sounded in disbelief, followed by everyone halting their actions and gathering around to look at the copper plaque on the ground.</p><p>"Who are you really?"</p><p>A man in his early thirties looked at Zhu Tianlei and asked, "This person's skills are the best among you all; even with Zhu Tianlei’s abilities, he couldn’t guarantee hitting every time." </p><p>"I am Zhu Tianlei."</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, everyone led by this man collectively drew a sharp breath. </p><p>Zhu Tianlei was somewhat surprised. Was there something wrong with his name? </p><p>"Why are you all just standing there? Don’t tell me none of you want money! Attack, attack!" </p><p>Although Tang Qingshan had been thrown out by Zhu Tianlei, the latter’s aim was accurate, causing Tang Qingshan immense pain but not any life-threatening injuries. </p><p>Seeing these assailants suddenly stop their attacks infuriated him to no end. He had been thoroughly humiliated by that brat and wanted revenge! </p><p>No matter how much he shouted, however, the attackers pretended as if they hadn’t heard a thing.</p><p>"Sorry!"</p><p>What? </p><p>Hearing the man before him speak, Zhu Tianlei was startled. An apology?</p><p>They were just fighting fiercely moments ago, and now they were apologizing? He didn’t believe they were scared of him. </p><p>"The old master once told us that there is someone named Zhu Tianlei who is an ally to our Black Eagle Gang. In the Black Eagle Gang, everyone treats the ally with the same respect as they do the old master. This Black Eagle Gang token exists in only three pieces—one in the old master’s hands, one in Young Master’s hands, and this very piece in the ally’s hand!"</p><p>The young man noticed Zhu Tianlei's confusion and explained slowly.</p><p>"Ally, we didn’t understand the situation earlier. We will automatically seek punishment from the old master when we return!"</p><p>The young man picked up the token on the ground and handed it to Zhu Tianlei with both hands, then gestured to his companions standing behind him.</p><p>"Everyone, restore everything that was damaged at the scene to its original condition and count the items. The count must only increase, not decrease!"</p><p>This time, not only did Zhu Tianlei go dumbfounded, so did Tang Qingshuan, Mao Yu, and the workers present on the scene; they were all like statues. What was going on?</p><p>Was it a play?</p><p>Or were they filming a movie?</p><p>There wasn’t even this exciting a scene in any movie!</p><p>"Benefactor, we have already counted the items, and someone will be in touch with you shortly. We apologize for the inconvenience!"</p><p>It took Zhu Tianlei until after these people finished counting to react.</p><p>"It’s okay, it was just a misunderstanding!"</p><p>"In our Black Eagle Gang, wrong is wrong, right is right; there are no misunderstandings. Attacking you, Benefactor, is an act of ingratitude and will result in punishment and consequences. Furthermore, we will take this person away and ensure that we give you an explanation. Goodbye!"</p><p>Watching these people depart en masse, with many limping, Zhu Tianlei felt like he was dreaming.</p><p>"What are you all doing, standing there stunned? You guys from the Black Eagle Gang are nothing but a bunch of cowards and garbage... "</p><p>Tang Qingshuan had been enraged to lose his composure and started berating them.</p><p>"Plug his mouth and take him away!"</p><p>The young man gave an order, and immediately someone took off their socks and stuffed them into Tang Qingshuan’s mouth before carrying him away.</p><p>Tang Qingshuan was nearly suffocated by the smell of the stinky socks as he glared hatefully at Zhu Tianlei who was getting farther and farther away. He couldn’t understand why that kid could be so arrogant, while he ended up losing so miserably.</p><p>"Great, great!"</p><p>Suddenly, a chorus of applause erupted all around, the clapping deafening.</p><p>Everyone was excitedly clapping their hands, as if they couldn't show how they felt without swelling their palms.</p><p>Mao Yu looked at Zhu Tianlei and smiled.</p><p>Her snow-white slender hand pounded Zhu Tianlei's chest once.</p><p>"Good boy, you did it!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had a fleeting sense of elation for the first time.</p><p>He lowered his head to look at the token in his hands, thinking about the first time he saw Ge Tianying, and couldn't help but laugh. He truly hadn't expected that the stubborn old man with such irritating speech would give him such a surprise.</p><p>The Black Eagle Gang was a renowned presence in Yunhai City, even in the entire underworld, said to have thousands of brothers scattered everywhere.</p><p>For the elder to say this, it could be imagined how much trust he placed in Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>After the interlude ended, the construction site fell completely silent again.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei also began to focus on the final phase of pharmaceutical development.</p><p>During this period, Yang Xiaoxue finally returned to Hamagou. Zhu Tianlei administered the newly developed pills to her for testing.</p><p>"Tianlei, it's so amazing! My stomach really doesn't hurt anymore!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue excitedly conveyed the news to Zhu Tianlei. She always experienced intense pain during menstruation but couldn't afford to rest in bed, making it truly unbearable. Zhu Tianlei's medication was almost like a salvation for her.</p><p>However, Yang Xiaoxue also made some suggestions: one, that the pills were too large and inconvenient to take; second, that the taste was too strong and hard to swallow.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei kissed Yang Xiaoxue several times as a reward, for his few women were all his lucky stars. According to Yang Xiaoxue's instructions, Zhu Tianlei modified the formula, reducing the size of the pills and increasing the dosage. He also added aromatic turmeric in the center of the pills, mixed with honey and caramel, not only masking the original taste but also giving it a faint sweetness.</p>

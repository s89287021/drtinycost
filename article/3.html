						<p>"Chen Guafu said it, so if I say I saw Chen Guafu push Hu Dainiu off the cliff with my own eyes, would you believe me?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei asked this question, and Yao Gang was actually stumped. However, people tend to stick to their initial impressions, especially since Chen Guafu was a woman, naturally carrying an aura that evoked sympathy.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei knew that Yao Gang didn't believe him, nor did the entire village. If he couldn't figure out what happened, he might end up taking the blame for Chen Guafu's accusations.</p><p>"Villager Leader, you have no evidence to claim that I pushed Hu Dainiu off Wangfeng Cliff. I don't accept it!"</p><p>"Humph, you don't accept it? Come on, let's go to the gourd cave right now. Once we find Dainiu's body, see what you say then!"</p><p>Li Fugui snorted coldly, Yao Gang glared at Li Fugui but didn't say anything. Although Li Fugui always tried to steal his thunder, this matter could only be handled as he suggested.</p><p>"Let's go right now!"</p><p>With someone taking the lead, the rest of the villagers also got excited and stirred up another sandstorm.</p><p>"Villager Leader, since Chen Guafu is the one who said it, she is a witness. Let's bring her along too!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sneered inwardly; he was actually curious about what abilities this Chen Guafu possessed.</p><p>Yao Gang had similar thoughts but Chen Guafu was still unconscious, so they handed the job of carrying her to Zhang Haisan. Seeing Li Fugui's eager expression, Yao Gang felt a bit vindictive satisfaction.</p><p>Zhang Haisan got his dream assignment and was so excited that saliva almost dripped from his chin. The two globes of flesh on Chen Guafu's chest pressed against his back, rubbing against it with each step, making Zhang Haisan nearly fly with excitement.</p><p>Seeing Zhu Qiezi also wanted to go, Zhu Tianlei stopped him. Zhu Qiezi originally didn't believe his son could do such a thing and since his wife was still unconscious, he nodded and carried her back home.</p><p>The villagers marched towards the gourd cave in full force, and about half an hour later, around eighty people crowded at the entrance of the gourd cave.</p><p>True to its name, the gourd cave had a small entrance but spacious inside, resembling an inverted gourd, with Wangfeng Cliff located within it.</p><p>Li Fugui went into the cave first, then everyone else followed one after another. It was noon, and the sunlight outside was strong, so when the villagers entered the cave, everything appeared pitch-black before their eyes. However, Zhu Tianlei's vision quickly scanned Wangfeng Cliff below.</p><p>I actually saw a person, with a bulky body, wearing a white hurdle-jumper's vest and earth-yellow loose-fitting pants. It couldn't be anyone other than Hu Daxiu.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's heart sank; this Chen widow was truly ruthless. Not only did she harm Hu Daxiu, but she also wanted to kill himself, clearly planning to cover up her tracks!</p><p>"Big Brother Daxiu! My son!"</p><p>Hu Madam reacted first and roared towards the Windward Cliff, but she was immediately pulled back by a fat aunt standing beside her. However, her cries didn't cease, almost toppling over the gourd cave.</p><p>"Hurry, send some people down to carry him up!"</p><p>Yao Gang's face was as dark as thunder. Before this moment, he still held a glimmer of hope that things weren't as bad as they seemed, but now, his hopes were shattered.</p><p>Several young men in their twenties jumped down immediately. Some lifted the arms, others the legs, and soon Hu Daxiu was carried up.</p><p>Hu Daxiu's body was covered in dirt and bloodstains; his face bore gashes, and the skin exposed by his vest and pants had hardly any intact spots, looking truly miserable.</p><p>Hu Madam was sobbing so hard she could barely catch her breath, and chaos ensued in the gourd cave.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, what have you got to say for yourself now?"</p><p>Yao Gang's eyes were cold enough to kill. As the village chief, he couldn't escape responsibility with a murderer in their midst.</p><p>"Yes, I always thought you weren't much of a good man, but who would have thought you'd actually commit murder!"</p><p>Hearing Yao Gang's words, the villagers stirred, spitting at Zhu Tianlei like rain.</p><p>"Whether or not I killed him, you'll know soon enough!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said calmly and walked over to Hu Daxiu. The people standing beside him subconsciously tensed up; after all, he was a murderer!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei squatted by Hu Daxiu's side. Just now, he noticed Hu Daxiu's chest moving slightly, though faintly. For Zhu Tianlei today, it was already enough.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, what are you doing? The person is already dead, aren't you even going to spare the corpse?"</p><p>The one speaking was Dr. and nurse of the village clinic, also the only highly educated person in the village, Ma Lanlan, who graduated from the city nursing school.</p><p>"Yes, the person is dead; moving a deceased body will be struck by lightning!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei ignored these people; he was no longer the previous Zhu Tianlei. He had spiritual medical skills.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, stop immediately!"</p><p>Seeing that Zhu Tianlei was indifferent to her words, Ma Lanlan's eyes turned red with anger.</p><p>She did not particularly like this Zhu Tianlei. Although he was idle and often leered at her, he had never done any substantial bad deeds, so she turned a blind eye to it.</p><p>But now, this bastard was actually desecrating the corpse, something she could not accept!</p><p>"Shut up!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was extremely irritated; he was searching in his mind for ways to handle Hu Daxiu's condition when Ma Lanlan kept pestering him.</p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p>"I can wake Hu Daxiu up!"</p><p>A flash of inspiration struck Zhu Tianlei, and he suddenly understood.</p><p>His heart finally calmed down. Ma Lanlan looked at Zhu Tianlei as if he were a monster, her mouth almost stretching to the back of her ears.</p><p>The villagers' attitudes were similar to Ma Lanlan's; they thought Zhu Tianlei was crazy. The person was dead, how could they still live?</p><p>"Hmph, you're just bragging. If you can really wake Hu Daxiu up, I, Ma Lanlan, will take your surname from now on!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan naturally didn't believe him, so she blurted out those harsh words without giving it a second thought.</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Ma Lanlan's pretty face, which resembled a bud, and gave her a wicked smile. Ma Lanlan's heart inexplicably pounded once.</p><p>At that moment, Zhu Tianlei could clearly locate all the acupoints on the human body. Therefore, he followed the instructions in Lingyi Xianshu and directed his palm towards Hu Daxiu's Fengmen point, gradually transferring the spiritual energy from his body to Hu Daxiu through his palm.</p><p>Ma Lanlan watched Zhu Tianlei's actions with a cold eye, her disdain and contempt clearly visible on her face.</p><p>After two minutes, Hu Daxiu's tightly closed eyelids moved slightly, and then he opened his eyes.</p><p>"Leizi?"</p><p>Seeing the enlarged face before him suddenly, Hu Daxiu was momentarily bewildered.</p><p>Ma Lanlan stared at Hu Daxiu in disbelief. This was absolutely impossible!</p><p>"Yes, Uncle Hu, it's good that you're awake; otherwise, I would have been wrongly accused to death!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said to Hu Daxiu with a smile and then raised his eyes to look at Ma Lanlan with a smirking expression.</p><p>"Doctor Ma, does what you just said still count?"</p>

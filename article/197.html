						<p>At ten o'clock, the annual meeting officially commenced.</p><p>The host of the event was a young girl with a black ponytail, prominent eyebrows, and big eyes. Sharp-eyed spectators immediately recognized her as Li Xiang, a reporter from Yunhai Minsheng Morning News.</p><p>Today, Li Xiang had not only been promoted but had also become the most outstanding on-site reporter at Yunhai Yunsheng after Huang Hai.</p><p>Upon seeing that the host was Li Xiang, the audience burst into applause.</p><p>"Dear esteemed leaders, fellow villagers, and colleagues from Tianlei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., as the golden rooster bid farewell to the old year and the golden dog welcomed the new one, we are holding our first annual staff meeting. On behalf of Mr. Zhan Tianlei, chairman of Tianlei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., I would like to thank everyone for your presence and express gratitude for the support from our friends and colleagues over the past year, as well as their efforts and contributions. Thank you!"</p><p>Li Xiang's voice was clear and crisp, amplified several times by the sound system.</p><p>The agenda for the meeting was not complicated, as intended by Mr. Zhan Tianlei. Essentially, it was akin to a gala; as long as everyone enjoyed themselves and had fun, that would suffice.</p><p>At this moment, several young women from the public relations department were performing modern dance on stage. They were lively, energetic, and fashionable, though amateur dancers, they managed to deliver an electrifying performance, bringing the atmosphere of the auditorium to a peak.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure dashed onto the stage. As soon as he reached the stage, he snatched the microphone from Li Xiang's hand who was standing beside him.</p><p>"Someone has been killed! Someone has been killed......"</p><p>The person shouting on stage was none other than Chen Fanglin, who had disappeared earlier.</p><p>This sudden turn of events silenced the entire auditorium.</p><p>"There has been a murder at Tianlei Pharmaceutical......"</p><p>Seeing no response from the audience, Chen Fanglin increased his volume. Nervous and excited, his voice trembled slightly.</p><p>Zhan Tianlei, sitting in the audience, observed Chen Fanglin coldly. He had not expected Chen Fanglin to still dare to make an appearance; it seemed that the old saying "If you do not uproot the grass thoroughly, spring winds will bring it back" held true.</p><p>"Chen Fanglin, you worthless rascal, what are you blabbering about......"</p><p>"Yes, are you jealous of how well Yun Tao is doing at Tianlei Pharmaceutical, so much so that you’re accusing him falsely........"</p><p>.......</p><p>After a brief silence, the auditorium became noisy again, but this time it was different from previous occasions. This time, all the public opinion was leaning towards Zhu Tianlei and Tianlei Pharmaceutical.</p><p>"The body is right outside the back storage room door; if you don’t believe me, go check......"</p><p>As soon as Chen Fanglin said this, it was like a huge stone had been thrown into still water, causing a massive splash.</p><p>Soon after, some curious people rushed towards the storage room at the back.</p><p>Ma Lanlan and Yang Xiaoxue, who were sitting next to Zhu Tianlei, stood up almost simultaneously.</p><p>Mao Yu, who was sitting on the far end, seemed much calmer. After all, she was used to it; Zhu Tianlei was a troublemaker, not causing any trouble would be abnormal for him.</p><p>"Tianlei, what’s going on?"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue, whose face was usually as pretty as a flower, now looked worried. Although her contact with Zhu Tianlei was the least among the four women, she was just as concerned.</p><p>"Just go and see."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression remained calm. Before Chen Fanglin appeared, he had thought that he could have a peaceful Spring Festival, but it seemed like he was wrong!</p><p>Seeing everyone rush towards the door crazily, a look of madness flashed across Chen Fanglin’s eyes. After running down from the stage, he glanced at Zhu Tianlei and also ran away quickly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei curled his lips; this time, he was going to make sure Chen Fanglin would never get back on his feet.</p><p>By the time Zhu Tianlei and the women arrived, they could hear a cry that pierced the clouds.</p><p>"Steelie, wake up! How can Mommy live without you!"</p><p>Cries reached Zhu Tianlei's ears, causing his blood to freeze in his veins.</p><p>His face turned ghastly pale as he pushed through the crowd and saw a woman sitting on the ground, cradling a tiny body. The small feet were adorned with a pair of brown leather shoes and light blue suspenders.</p><p>Without hesitation, Zhu Tianlei knelt down and snatched the child from the woman's arms.</p><p>It was really Little Steelie.</p><p>For an instant, Zhu Tianlei felt his vision blur and could barely make out Little Steelie's appearance.</p><p>"Who are you? Give me my son back..."</p><p>Little Steelie's mother was also a doctor. When Little Steelie was sent to the isolation zone, she was dispatched to another city for disease research. By the time Little Steelie recovered, she had been providing medical support elsewhere and was not present at the scene, so she did not recognize Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>However, Zhu Tianlei had no mood to deal with her at that moment. He felt Little Steelie's cold little hand and trembled, unsure how to infuse his spiritual energy into the child.</p><p>Failing to reclaim her son, Little Steelie's mother lunged at Zhu Tianlei frenziedly. Her long nails instantly drew a long gash across Zhu Tianlei's back.</p><p>But Zhu Tianlei was oblivious, allowing her punches to rain down on him like hail on his body and head.</p><p>All he could think about was saving Little Steelie, saving him.</p><p>"Help! Zhu Tianlei is trying to dispose of the body!"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei about to pick up Little Steelie, Chen Fanglin feared something untoward might happen and began shouting loudly.</p><p>Meanwhile, several unfamiliar men emerged from the crowd. Chen Fanglin's eyes flicked towards them, and before he could react, he too lunged at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Just as Chen Fanglin was about to reach Zhu Tianlei's back, a powerful gust of air struck him squarely. He felt a sharp pain in his chest and flew backward.</p><p>"Dead, really dead......"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's hand was placed on Xiao Gangbang's chest. His spiritual energy was already very pure, but Xiao Gangbang's tiny body felt like a glass wall, blocking all of his spiritual energy.</p><p>He didn't want to believe it, but he had no choice but to accept it. This innocent and adorable child, whom he had brought back from the brink of death and spent a long time with, was really dead!</p><p>His fists clenched tightly, veins bulged on his forearms, and his eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>He gently laid Xiao Gangbang down on the ground as if afraid of waking up the child's beautiful dream.</p><p>However, when he stood up and turned around, Chen Fanglin, along with everyone who saw Zhu Tianlei, took a step back in fright.</p><p>No one had ever seen Zhu Tianlei truly angry—anyone!</p><p>"Dead, really dead......"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's hand rested on Xiao Gangbang's chest. Despite his pure spiritual energy, Xiao Gangbang's small body acted like an impenetrable glass wall, blocking all of Zhu's efforts.</p><p>He didn't want to accept it, but he had to. This innocent and adorable child, whom he had rescued from the brink of death and spent a long time with, was truly dead!</p><p>His fists clenched tightly, veins bulged on his forearms, and his eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>Gently placing Xiao Gangbang down on the ground, he was as if afraid to wake him from his peaceful dream.</p><p>However, when he stood up and turned around, Chen Fanglin and everyone else who saw Zhu Tianlei took a step back in fear.</p><p>No one had ever witnessed Zhu Tianlei's true anger—no one!</p><p>"Dead... truly dead..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's hand rested on Xiao Gangbang's chest. Despite his pristine spiritual energy, Xiao Gangbang's small frame felt like an impenetrable glass wall, blocking all of Zhu's efforts.</p><p>He refused to believe it, yet he could not deny the truth. This innocent and adorable child, whom he had rescued from the brink of death and shared countless moments with, was truly dead!</p><p>His fists clenched tightly, veins bulged on his forearms, and his eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>Gently placing Xiao Gangbang down on the ground, as if afraid to disturb his peaceful dream, Zhu stood up and turned around. Chen Fanglin and everyone else who saw him took a step back in fear.</p><p>No one had ever witnessed Zhu Tianlei's true anger—no one!</p>

						<p>Dr. Zhu seemed quite surprised. He was enjoying himself, so the old woman couldn't just let it go, could she? How about it, Dr. Zhu, want to give it a try? I'll give you a discount.</p><p>Listening to Wu Xiaohui's increasingly incoherent words, Zhu Tianlei decided not to deal with her anymore and turned to leave.</p><p>Wu Xiaohui said while reaching out to grab Zhu Tianlei's arm.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei instinctively slapped away Wu Xiaohui's hand. Her grip couldn't hold on, causing the blanket she was wearing to slip off.</p><p>Under the flickering yellow light, the woman's body emitted a certain enticing glow.</p><p>"Help! Dr. Zhu is molesting me!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hadn't expected Wu Xiaohui to be so persistent and felt as if he had swallowed a fly.</p><p>As Wu Xiaohui's voice echoed, the doors of various wards gradually opened, and medical staff rushed out from the rest area in their clothes.</p><p>Wu Xiaohui looked at Zhu Tianlei triumphantly, almost declaring her victory.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei maintained a cold expression.</p><p>He turned away without looking back and left.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you bastard, do you hate how dirty I am? What's wrong with being dirty, it's also about earning money by one's skills......"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei's cold and resolute back, Wu Xiaohui suddenly burst into tears.</p><p>That night was destined to be anything but peaceful.</p><p>This night, the weaknesses of humanity were exposed to public scrutiny.</p><p>This night became the most talked-about event among all those who had lived in the quarantine zone for several years thereafter.</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>"Zhanlei, Zhanlei, it's bad! Patient Wu Xiaohui in room 1209 is dead!"</p><p>What?</p><p>Doctor Zhu Tianlei jumped out of bed abruptly.</p><p>Wu Xiaohui was dead?</p><p>Seeing Li Ping's grave expression, Zhu Tianlei felt as if several bombs were exploding simultaneously in his head.</p><p>By the time Zhu Tianlei and Li Ping arrived at the door of room 1209, the place was already packed with people.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei walked in, everyone's expressions varied; after all, most people had witnessed what happened last night. Even those who hadn't seen it, the news had spread like a bird with wings throughout the entire quarantine zone.</p><p>Xue Ping and Shen Haifeng were both there, though since Wu Xiaohui had died naked, Shen Haifeng, being a young man without medical training, looked somewhat uncomfortable and stood far behind Xue Ping.</p><p>In fact, it was quite normal for patients to die in the quarantine zone; after all, it was common for infectious diseases to take lives. However, what was unusual about last night was Wu Xiaohui's final words and the naked state of his body at death.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, it seems to be respiratory failure caused by lung infection."</p><p>Seeing Doctor Zhu come in, Xue Ping reported her findings.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stared blankly at Wu Xiaohui's body. Though covered with a white sheet, leaving only the head and feet visible, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but recall last night's scene under the dim lighting—a naked corpse with numerous bruises all over.</p><p>His head felt heavy.</p><p>"Take him away!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei wanted to bend down to check the body, but as he squatted, he felt his throat constrict and his stomach churn.</p><p>Having said that, Zhu Tianlei quickly stepped out of the crowd.</p><p>He rushed out of the long corridor like a gust of wind, reaching the only open space in the quarantine zone.</p><p>The ground was covered with yellow soil, the sky above was a pale blue, and a gentle breeze blew. Sparrows perched on the iron bars, chirping softly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's heartbeat finally began to return to normal.</p><p>This was the second death in the quarantine zone.</p><p>He didn't care what others thought or felt; he only felt guilty towards Yang Wenjie, the healthcare workers and patients who unconditionally trusted him, as well as his loved ones who worried about him every day.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei closed his eyes, stretched out his arms, and let the morning light fall upon his face and body. Suddenly, Zhu Tianlei's eyes shot open, and he ran quickly towards the morgue without turning back.</p><p>To promptly address the storage issue of patient bodies and prevent them from becoming a source of infection, the morgue was established alongside the quarantine zone right from its inception.</p><p>It was an empty room with several cold storage units.</p><p>However, only one body was stored in those units. Perhaps this was the only thing that made Zhu Tianlei feel slightly better!</p><p>"Doctor Zhu?"</p><p>Xue Ping looked surprised as she saw Zhu Tianlei come in. Even a fool could tell that Zhu Tianlei had been in a terrible mood just now, and although she fully trusted his character, she knew how terrifying rumors could be.</p><p>"Sister Xue, I need to perform an autopsy!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression was unusually resolute, completely different from the bewildered person who had run out earlier.</p><p>But this Zhu Tianlei is the one in Xue Ping's heart, a man who can remain calm even before the Grim Reaper.</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Wu Xiaohui's body was placed on the dissection table. As soon as the white shroud covering his body was removed, Wu Xiaohui appeared before the two of them.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei carefully examined the bruises on Wu Xiaohui's body, and his gaze gradually became deep.</p><p>He was no stranger to the marks left after intimate relations, but these were certainly not like those on Wu Xiaohui's body.</p><p>"Sister Xue, do you notice anything special about these marks?"</p><p>Xue Ping knew that Zhu Tianlei definitely had something in mind with this question, so she quickly lowered her head and carefully examined the bruises on Wu Xiaohui's body.</p><p>"These marks seem to be caused by broken capillaries, somewhat similar to those of systemic lupus erythematosus!"</p><p>After observing for a while, Xue Ping said hesitantly.</p><p>"Look closely; these marks are clearly beneath the dermis. If it were due to broken capillaries, the marks wouldn't be so prominent. This is bleeding from an internal organ."</p><p>Bleeding from an internal organ?</p><p>Xue Ping was stunned. She had dealt with patients who had experienced internal organ bleeding before, but they never exhibited such marks on their bodies.</p><p>"I got it, Sister Xue! I understand!"</p><p>Suddenly, Zhu Tianlei's eyes lit up as he looked at Xue Ping and said excitedly.</p><p>Although Xue Ping didn't know what Zhu Tianlei had figured out, she couldn't help her heart skip a beat when she saw him brighten up, the gloom lifting from his face.</p><p>"Sister Xue, I'm going to the lab now. Don't disturb me unless it's an emergency!"</p><p>After finishing, Zhu Tianlei vanished from the morgue as quickly as a whirlwind.</p><p>Back in the research lab, Zhu Tianlei picked up a pen and began writing furiously on a piece of paper. Despite having little formal education, Zhu Tianlei had an elegant handwriting style.</p><p>In just a few minutes, neat and tidy rows of text appeared on the paper. Zhu Tianlei only glanced at it before rushing towards the medicine cabinet.</p><p>This time, his mind was incredibly clear, and his movements were agile and swift.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was completely engrossed in his own world, with time and environment fading into nothingness.</p><p>When he finally finished and pushed open the door, he jumped back in surprise.</p>

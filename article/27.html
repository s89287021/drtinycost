						<p>At one moment, the room was silent, as if even the air had come to a standstill. All faces were deathly pale, and the fear in their eyes was like a cataclysmic storm. In an instant, all their weapons fell to the ground; it took no more than twenty seconds, and they hadn't managed to strike back or even see the figure of their opponent clearly. Such agility was not human! "How about it, Sun Jiang? Want me to break which leg first?" ZHU Tianlei pretended not to notice the glares and thoughts of the crowd, simply reaching out to pat Sun Jiang's shoulder lightly. The voice was soft, but in Sun Jiang's ears, it sounded like a death knell. "Y-you... dare!..." Sun Jiang knew himself that his words lacked any confidence; at this point, what did the other party fear? Even if his cousin rushed over, his leg would likely be crippled long ago! "Oh? So you've always thought I wouldn't dare!" ZHU Tianlei seemed to have had an epiphany. Sun Jiang's body couldn't help but shudder as a snap echoed, and his left leg bone was immediately broken. Overwhelmed by agony, Sun Jiang no longer cared about his dignity and let out blood-curdling screams. None of the goons dared to come over and help Sun Jiang; their greed for money had long been dispelled by the fear of death. "Xiao Mei, are you okay?" ZHU Tianlei ignored Sun Jiang and walked straight to HAO Xinmei's side, asking gently.</p><p>Hao Xinmei looked at Zhu Tianlei before her, unsure of her own feelings. This Sun Jiang was no ordinary person; even if she had money, it would be impossible to smooth things over. Zhu Tianlei had beaten up the other party twice, and the Sun family would not easily let go, all because of what she had done.</p><p>"I'm fine, Tianlei, you get out quickly! I'll handle the rest!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei already had a plan in mind. She was the boss of Meixin Pharmaceutical and counted as someone important in Yunhai City. No matter what, she could not let Zhu Tianlei be involved.</p><p>"You're going to handle it?"</p><p>"Yes, Tianlei, get out quickly! Before the Sun family arrives!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Hao Xinmei's slightly flushed face from the urgency, warmth appeared in his eyes, much better than the cold and beautiful look he had shown before.</p><p>"Little Mei, I'm a man. If something happens, leaving you with the mess while I run away is not something I, Zhu Tianlei, would do, nor will I ever do it. Besides, you're a woman; by nature, you should be protected!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei rarely spoke so seriously, but these words made Hao Xinmei's tears well up and spill out immediately.</p><p>She had once dreamed in her sleep that someone would say such things to her. Over the years, she had been a dominant force in business, enduring hardships all alone. She even forgot that she was a woman who needed protection too.</p><p>"Tianlei, thank you! But listen to me, the Sun family is powerful in Yunhai City. Don't say it's just an ordinary person like you; even someone ten times more capable than you would find no benefit in the hands of the Sun family. I may be a woman, but I have run a business in Yunhai City for many years. Rest assured, I'll handle it!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei suppressed her emotions but became even more determined to protect Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Looking at the woman before him who was trying to appear strong despite holding back tears, seeds seemed to be sown in Zhu Tianlei's heart, with certain feelings starting to take root and grow.</p><p>"I won't leave!"</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Just as Hao Xinmei wanted to open her mouth again to persuade Zhu Tianlei, hurried footsteps sounded at the door. The person hadn't even reached close when their voice could already be heard.</p><p>"Who is causing trouble here?"</p><p>Hao Xinmei's face immediately darkened when she heard the voice. They came so quickly!</p><p>As soon as her words were out, an old man wearing a white shirt and gray trousers walked in from the door, followed by seven or eight people in police uniforms.</p><p>"General Sun, it's me!"</p><p>Seeing the visitors, Hao Xinmei stepped forward first.</p><p>General Sun glanced at Hao Xinmei with a peculiar look, showing no surprise at all that she was there.</p><p>"Dad, Dad, they're going to kill my son! Dad, I'm going to die!"</p><p>As soon as he saw his father arrive, Sun Jiang immediately crawled over to General Sun's feet and hugged his uncle Jian Guo's leg with the uninjured arm, wailing like a frightened animal.</p><p>Sun Jian Guo watched his son clinging to his leg, his heart instantly tightening. Throughout his life, he had been unscrupulous in his amours, considered himself endlessly charming, but the seeds of those pursuits sank into oblivion like stones thrown into the sea.</p><p>Having finally fathered Sun Jiang at almost forty, he indulged him excessively; both parents practically deferred to him without question.</p><p>It was precisely because of this that Sun Jiang was illiterate and spent his days drinking, gambling, and partying with friends. However, Sun Jian Guo did not care; the Sun family had ample wealth. Even if Sun Jiang failed miserably, their assets would last for generations.</p><p>Moreover, he had already planned to find a clever and capable wife for his son, under whose guidance Sun Jiang might make some progress. He had long decided on Hao Xinmei as that person.</p><p>He did not expect Hao Xinmei to be indifferent, even cold, towards Sun Jiang; reportedly, they had clashed yesterday. Knowing his son's character, he promised to confine Sun Jiang as a means of appeasing Hao Xinmei but never imagined that Sun Jiang would run away from home.</p><p>Just then, he received a call from the restaurant manager and rushed over in panic, but he never anticipated that his beloved son would be beaten so badly.</p><p>"Xiao Jiang, get up quickly!"</p><p>Sun Jian Guo's heart ached as if it were bleeding. The cold-blooded 'business warlord' trembled even as he spoke.</p><p>"Dad, my leg has been broken by that beast. I'll end up paralyzed, Dad. I'm not filial; I can't fulfill my duty to you and Mom anymore!"</p><p>Sun Jiang cried with his face smeared with tears and snot. He was genuinely terrified; if his father hadn't come in time, that man could have killed him. That guy didn't care about his life!</p><p>"Zhang Ye, help Sun Jiang up and get Doctor Zhao over here immediately!"</p><p>Sun Jianguo had a stern look on his face as he suppressed the anger boiling inside.</p><p>Daring to beat up his son like this showed they didn't take him, Sun Jianguo, seriously. In Yunhai City, if Sun Jianguo wanted someone's life, he didn't need to do it himself.</p><p>A man in a suit walked over and carefully helped Sun Jiang up. The moment he moved his arm, Sun Jiang let out another howl.</p><p>Those screams pierced through Sun Jianguo's heart like gasoline poured on a flame.</p><p>"Who did this?"</p><p>Sun Jianguo glared at everyone in the room without any sign of anger, but those familiar with him knew that Sun Jianguo was already pushing the limits of his patience.</p><p>"You are a fool, someone who relies on others' power, and someone who overestimates themselves!"</p>

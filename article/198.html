						<p>Little Steel Spring's mother saw her son being laid down and immediately lunged forward, hugging him tightly in her arms. The wailing and sobbing ceased; she merely clung to her son's lifeless body like a puppet.</p><p>Her eyes were vacant, and her lips moved up and down as she repeatedly called out her son's name.</p><p>Those who heard it shed tears, those who saw it felt their hearts wounded.</p><p>"Zhu...... Zhu Tianlei, what are you looking at me for? The person wasn't killed by me; it was her......"</p><p>Chen Fanglin was so terrified by Zhu Tianlei's cold stare that his legs trembled uncontrollably. He sat on the ground, still shivering, while his finger pointed to a figure huddled in a corner not far away.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao leaned against the wall, holding her knees, her face pale and lips devoid of color.</p><p>Because of her position in a remote corner at the factory's turn, nobody had noticed her initially. However, as Chen Fanglin finished speaking, everyone's gaze fell on Zhang Yuntao.</p><p>"Chen Fanglin, shut your mouth! Zhang Yuntao is just a little girl who can't even kill a chicken, how could she dare to kill someone?"</p><p>Zhang Haishan was the first to stand up and defend Zhang Yuntao.</p><p>Although he knew he had no chance in his life to be close to Zhang Yuntao, he always felt fond of this little girl.</p><p>Why is Zhang Yuntao here?</p><p>He thought Chen Fanglin's scheme was aimed at him, so he didn't care. But now, seeing Zhang Yuntao shivering and pale-faced, his heart momentarily panicked.</p><p>Without thinking, Zhu Tianlei walked toward Zhang Yuntao.</p><p>"Yuntao......"</p><p>"Ahh! Let go of me, let go of me...... I didn't mean to, I really didn't mean to......."</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei walk over, Zhang Yuntao, contrary to her usual behavior, did not rush into his arms as she used to. Instead, the moment Zhu Tianlei reached out with both hands, she acted like a mad person and pushed Zhu Tianlei's hands away.</p><p>Shaking her head, she screamed loudly.</p><p>However, Zhang Yuntao's reaction caused many people's expressions to change dramatically.</p><p>Not intentionally, could this little child really be killed by Zhang Yuntao?</p><p>"Yuntao, calm down, it's me, Tianlei..."</p><p>Seeing his usually gentle and graceful woman transform into this state before him, Zhu Tianlei was heartbroken beyond words. Ignoring the opinions of those around him, he embraced Zhang Yuntao tightly.</p><p>"Yuntao, it's me, Tianlei. Don't be afraid, I'm here, everything will be fine..."</p><p>"I didn't mean to do it, I really didn't mean to... sob sob..."</p><p>No matter how much Zhu Tianlei tried to comfort her, Zhang Yuntao seemed lost in her own world, unable to come back to reality. Her hands wildly flailed and scratched, but Zhu Tianlei remained still, allowing Zhang Yuntao to vent.</p><p>"Hmph, killing requires a price. Today, I, Chen Fanglin, will uphold justice by punishing my kin. This woman looks delicate, but she is truly vicious, even going as far as killing a child. Just seeing this makes me feel heartache..."</p><p>Seeing the gazes of those around him and observing Zhang Yuntao, who was in Zhu Tianlei's arms, somewhat deranged from fright, Chen Fanglin experienced a sense of revengeful satisfaction.</p><p>You think you're great, Zhu Tianlei? See what you can do now?</p><p>"Chen Fanglin, did you see Zhang Yuntao kill with your own eyes?"</p><p>The villagers were not fools, and given Chen Fanglin's lack of credibility, even if Zhang Yuntao admitted it herself, the villagers remained skeptical.</p><p>"Nonsense, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, would I be able to say such things? No matter what Zhang Yuntao says, she is still part of my family, Chen. I couldn't bear to watch anymore, so I had no choice but to act..."</p><p>Chen Fanglin put on a look of profound sorrow, but inside he felt like water boiling over, continuously churning.</p><p>"How possible is that? This child looks only 4 or 5 years old..."</p><p>"Spit, fat lady, are you calling me Chen Fanglin a liar? Let me tell you, I saw Zhang Yuntao kill this little thing with my own eyes..."</p><p>Chen Fanglin spoke with conviction.</p><p>"Humph, if one has nothing to hide, they fear not the ghosts at night. Could Zhang Yuntao have been so frightened if he wasn't guilty of theft?"</p><p>Indeed, Chen Fanglin's words had truly branded Zhang Yuntao as a murderer.</p><p>"Did you kill my son?"</p><p>Steel Coin Mom, who had been wallowing in grief, suddenly raised her head and looked at Zhang Yuntao with a sinister expression, asking, "Did you kill my son?"</p><p>"It wasn't me.....I didn't mean to....."</p><p>Zhang Yuntao, held in Zhu Tianlei's arms, heard Steel Coin Mom's words and her barely controlled emotions once again shattered.</p><p>"Give me back my son's life!"</p><p>Hearing Zhang Yuntao's words, Steel Coin Mom threw aside Little Steel Coin's body and lunged at Zhang Yuntao. Of course, Zhu Tianlei couldn't let the other person harm Zhang Yuntao, but he also couldn't retaliate. In a hurry, he could only fully protect Zhang Yuntao in his arms, with his back facing Steel Coin Mom.</p><p>"Give me my son...give me my son..."</p><p>Steel Coin Mom was like a raging cheetah, and Zhang Yuntao was her prey. She did not care about the consequences or conserve energy; she disregarded all methods, just crazily wanting to tear Zhang Yuntao apart, wanting him to pay for her beloved son's life.</p><p>The woman's sharp nails scratched Zhu Tianlei's earlobe and neck, while her fists pounded like raindrops on his back. She grabbed at Zhu Tianlei's short hair, trying with all her might to pull him away.</p><p>But Zhu Tianlei remained as immovable as a stone from Mount Tai, no matter how the woman tugged or battered him.</p><p>"Madam, please calm down..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei could remain indifferent, but Ma Lanlan and Yang Xiaoxue couldn't. Seeing Zhu Tianlei being beaten up by the women in a humiliating manner, the two rushed forward to pull them apart.</p><p>"Unbelievable, Tianlei Pharmaceuticals is about to commit murder! This is too outrageous even in broad daylight..."</p><p>Seeing Ma Lanlan and Yang Xiaoxue approaching, Chen Fanglin immediately began screaming like a madman. No one noticed that his gaze had discreetly swept through the crowd.</p><p>"Yeah, we have to stop them, we can't let them get away with it..."</p><p>Someone in the crowd shouted, and those closest to Zhu Tianlei were pushed by someone, losing control of their bodies and surging towards Zhu Tianlei and the women.</p><p>This action was like throwing a huge stone into still water; the previously calm crowd erupted. Dozens of people rolled up their sleeves and joined the fray.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue, standing at the very edge, was suddenly grabbed by the hair, causing her to scream in agony.</p><p>"Too much! This is too much!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue's scream pierced Zhu Tianlei's ears, instantly breaking his composure.</p><p>He held Zhang Yuntao close and abruptly stood up.</p><p>With a flick of his fingers, he pressed down on Steel Coin Mama's shoulder. Her body immediately weakened, and she fell to the ground. Following this, Zhu Tianlei pulled Yang Xiaoxue and Ma Lanlan behind him, straightened up, and glared with eyes like knives, piercing through everyone's hearts.</p><p>"Chen... Fang... Lin!"</p><p>He spoke each word deliberately, cutting deep into their souls.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the crowd felt shadows flicker around them, a slight breeze blowing past. Upon closer inspection, they all sucked in cold air.</p>

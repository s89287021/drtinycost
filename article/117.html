						<p>Sun JianGuo knew that the situation was not in his favor at present, but he had handled everything very discreetly, leaving no room for accusation. Thus, he gritted his teeth and shouted sternly,</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled and calmly took out a small square object from his clothing. Those with keen eyesight immediately recognized that Zhu Tianlei was holding a portable hard drive.</p><p>"Members of the court, here is the evidence that Chairman Sun requested."</p><p>All media personnel stretched their necks to get a better view; it was an incredibly thrilling moment, undoubtedly the most sensational news in Yunhai City this year.</p><p>After a short while, the staff who had listened to the recording whispered to each other for a few moments.</p><p>"Adjournment is granted. The next court session will be scheduled separately!"</p><p>The media were disappointed; they had been eagerly waiting to hear the contents of the recording.</p><p>"Hold it! I, Sun JianGuo, believe that I have not committed any illegal acts, and the so-called evidence is either nonexistent or fabricated. For fairness' sake, why don't all honorable members of the court disclose this evidence on the spot?"</p><p>Sun JianGuo initially felt a chill in his heart, but when the court officials announced the rescheduling of the trial, he saw Zhu Tianlei visibly relieve himself and let out a sigh of relief; Hao Xinmei did the same.</p><p>Why were they so relieved? If the evidence was genuine, they should have welcomed their demise in court. They clearly intended to stall for time before manipulating things behind the scenes.</p><p>Hmph, think again! Sun JianGuo would not give them that chance!</p><p>The few court officials were taken aback by Sun JianGuo's request. Deputy Director Su had already warned them about this possibility, so they had decided to postpone the trial in order to give Sun JianGuo some time to prepare.</p><p>"Chairman Sun, are you certain?"</p><p>A court official politely reminded him.</p><p>"Certain! I, Sun JianGuo, have always acted with integrity and fear no foul play from villains."</p><p>Sun Jianguo’s domineering presence returned.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained expressionless on the surface, but inwardly he sneered.</p><p>“Since the defendant requests it, we will publicly display the evidence in court.”</p><p>Several minutes later, in the vast courtroom, a hissing sound from the audio system came to life.</p><p>......</p><p>“Mr. Chairman Sun, rest assured, everything is under control. Zhu Tianlei won’t escape, hehe. About that thirty thousand you promised me?”</p><p>“Rest assured, if the matter is handled well, don’t mention thirty thousand, I’ll give you sixty thousand, but on one condition: you must ensure that Zhu never recovers from this!”</p><p>“Hehe, rest assured, when Tang Qingsheng takes action, he never fails!”</p><p>......</p><p>Segments of recorded audio were played.</p><p>Sun Jianguo’s legs stiffened and he couldn’t move.</p><p>He stared at Zhu Tianlei, fixating on his face, wanting to peel off that constantly smiling mask to see the true person beneath.</p><p>How could this person be so terrifying?</p><p>Is he really just a village doctor?</p><p>All the media outlets were eagerly listening to the recording, their recorders and cameras never stopping as they captured every movement in the courtroom and every expression on each person's face.</p><p>“Puh!”</p><p>Suddenly, Sun Jianguo, who was standing at the defendant’s stand, spat out a mouthful of blood. The blood seemed like blooming crimson safflowers, glaring and eye-catching.</p><p>Sun Jianguo could no longer hold on, his vision spinning before him. In that moment as he fell, he wondered if Zhu Tianlei had killed him!</p><p>The trial that rocked the entire Yunhai City came to an end!</p><p>This trial was extraordinarily lively and full of surprises.</p><p>That night, almost all the television stations, newspapers, public accounts, and new media platforms made this event their top story, reaping substantial ratings and clicks.</p><p>As twilight fell,</p><p>Yunhai City immersed itself in a colorful night sky resembling the descent of sunlight.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei and Hao Xinhui sat side by side in a pavilion halfway up the mountain, looking down at the bustling city below, which constantly devoured hopes while creating miracles.</p><p>"Tianlei, thank you. If not for you, I really wouldn’t know what to do."</p><p>Hao Xinhui’s voice rang out, soft and tender like a little kitten.</p><p>"Naive girl, why should you thank me? Your matters are mine. Unless you say you don't like me or don't want to marry me as your wife."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei affectionately tousled Hao Xinhui's hair and said with a smile.</p><p>This time, Hao Xinhui did not argue back but instead nestled into Zhu Tianlei’s embrace.</p><p>"How did you find Han Lin and persuade him to hand over such important recording evidence to you?"</p><p>Until the trial, Hao Xinmei was uncertain about the whole situation because she had no clue about these matters. Han Lin knew, being one of the key figures in Sun Jianguo's creation of the Sun Pharmaceutical Empire. Persuading someone like Han Lin would be incredibly challenging.</p><p>"You don't know, right? Han Lin and Tu Feng were good friends privately, and Han Lin and Sun Jianguo had long been at odds. Han Lin felt that Sun Jianguo was becoming bolder and feared he might suffer in the future. That's why he secretly installed a listening device in Sun Jianguo's office, planning to use it for his own protection someday."</p><p>"Oh? A listening device?"</p><p>Hao Xinmei exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>"Yes, I saved his best friend and promised that if they could testify against Sun Jianguo, Tianlei Pharmaceuticals and Meixin Pharmaceutical would allow them to choose either company, with salaries 30% higher than their current ones and managerial positions."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke casually, but Hao Xinmei knew how much effort he had put into it, unable to help but caress Zhu Tianlei's clearly emaciated face.</p><p>The moonlight was hazy. Zhu Tianlei looked at the beautiful and somewhat surreal Hao Xinmei before him, his primal desires stirring again.</p><p>His lips descended.</p><p>Hao Xinmei did not struggle as Zhu Tianlei laid her down on the concrete chair.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's agile tongue explored, slowly sliding to Hao Xinmei's sexy collarbone. The collarbone was deep, as if it held a rich wine.</p><p>His nimble tongue used his teeth to open one button of her black suit after another, and then he saw the snow mountain he had longed for.</p><p>With a swift push of his large hand, the snow mountain trembled in the moonlight.</p><p>On the peak of the snow mountain, two red beans stood out against the white snow, more beautiful than ever. His teeth sank in, the soft red beans slowly ripening and blossoming into alluring flowers.</p><p>"Mmm..."</p><p>The sighs were an invitation, merging with the night to intoxicate Zhu Tianlei further.</p>

						<p>"Don't mess around; if someone sees us, we'll be in trouble!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan blushed and wriggled her body. The heat from Zhu Tianlei's breath had teased the tip of her ears, making them feel like they were on fire.</p><p>"Lanlan, when can I have you?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words sounded a bit mournful. Thinking back to those times he was repeatedly interrupted at crucial moments, he felt bitter in his heart.</p><p>Just as Ma Lanlan was about to speak, Zhu Tianlei's phone rang.</p><p>"Hurry up and answer it!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan wriggled free from Zhu Tianlei's arm, and he nipped her neck again before finally taking out the phone.</p><p>"Ge Yang?"</p><p>Seeing the name on the screen, Zhu Tianlei was momentarily stunned. After a while, he recalled who Ge Yang was.</p><p>"Hello!"</p><p>"Brother Zhu, please help me!"</p><p>Ge Yang's voice trembled and sounded hoarse on the other end, clearly having cried recently.</p><p>Although they had little contact and hardly exchanged more than ten sentences, Zhu Tianlei knew that Ge Yang was very strong. He didn't believe that Lu Kang still dared to provoke Ge Yang.</p><p>"Ge Yang, what happened? How can I know how to help you if you don't tell me?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei wasn't one to meddle in others' affairs; last time he had acted purely out of compassion. However, his impression of Ge Yang was indeed good, or perhaps there was something about Ge Yang that made it hard for him to say no.</p><p>"My grandfather is dying! Brother Zhu, I know you can save him. Please help me!"</p><p>"Don't mess around; if someone sees us, we'll be in trouble!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan blushed and wriggled her body.

Brother Zhu, I know you can save him. Please help me!"</p><p>"Don't tease around; if someone sees us, we'll be in big trouble!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan blushed and wriggled her body, the heat from Zhu Tianlei's breath tickling her ears like a flame.</p><p>"Lanlan, when can I finally have you?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words held a hint of wistfulness. Recalling those times he was repeatedly interrupted at crucial moments made his heart ache.</p><p>Just as Ma Lanlan was about to speak, Zhu Tianlei's phone rang.</p><p>"Hurry up and answer it!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan wriggled free from Zhu Tianlei's arm, who nipped her neck playfully before finally taking out the phone.</p><p>"Ge Yang?"</p><p>Seeing the name on the screen, Zhu Tianlei was momentarily stunned. After a while, he recalled who Ge Yang was.</p><p>"Hello!"</p><p>"Brother Zhu, please help me!"</p><p>Ge Yang's voice trembled and sounded hoarse on the other end, clearly having cried recently.</p><p>Although they had little contact and hardly exchanged more than ten sentences, Zhu Tianlei knew that Ge Yang was very strong.

How can I help you if you don't tell me?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei wasn't one to meddle in others' affairs; last time he had acted purely out of compassion. However, his impression of Ge Yang was indeed good—there was something about him that made it hard for Zhu to say no.</p><p>"My grandfather is dying! Brother Zhu, I know you can save him. Please help me!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned. How could Ge Yang know he was skilled in medicine? He had never mentioned it, and he hadn't demonstrated his skills that day.</p><p>"Ge Yang, who told you I could save your grandfather?"</p><p>There was a noticeable pause on the other end of the line, and Zhu Tianlei's heart sank.</p><p>"Brother Zhu, please, I only have my grandfather as family. If he dies, I..."</p><p>Ge Yang didn't reply.</p><p>"Ge Yang, let me ask you again, how did you know I could save your grandfather?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was giving Ge Yang a chance; he hoped Ge Yang would tell the truth.</p><p>"Brother Zhu, I...I..."</p><p>Listening to Ge Yang's hesitant voice on the other end of the line, Zhu Tianlei lightly traced his finger over the red hang-up key, ending the call.</p><p>What Zhu Tianlei hated most were lies.</p><p>The phone rang again almost immediately. Without even glancing at it, Zhu Tianlei picked up the mop from Ma Lanlan's hand and continued mopping the unfinished floor.</p><p>Ma Lanlan glanced at the telephone on the table; since Zhu Tianlei had hung up, the phone hadn't stopped ringing, one call following another without interruption. Zhu Tianlei's face remained stern, showing no intention of answering.</p><p>Ma Lanlan rarely saw Zhu Tianlei with such a stern expression, even during Li Dacui's incident at the clinic when his demeanor was much better than now. Who could it be calling?</p><p>Ma Lanlan felt puzzled but didn't ask; if Zhu Tianlei wanted her to know, he would tell her directly. This was the modesty and wisdom of a woman.</p><p>Ten whole minutes later, Zhu Tianlei finally put down the mop and picked up the phone again.</p><p>"Brother Zhu, I...I mean, Grandfather had someone investigate you. Grandfather didn't have any other intention; he only wanted to take care of me and protect me. I know what Grandfather did isn't right, but I couldn't stop him. I... Brother Zhu, I'm sorry!"</p><p>Ge Yang struggled inwardly but eventually spoke the truth. He knew that his grandfather's actions were morally questionable, after all, Zhu Tianlei had saved his life. Not only did they fail to repay him, but they even secretly hired someone to investigate him. It was no surprise that Zhu Tianlei was angry.</p><p>Investigated?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't expect that one day he would be investigated by others. Wasn't that fortunate?</p><p>"Brother Zhu, I know it's my and my grandfather's fault for disappointing you. I shouldn't have asked for your help shamelessly, but I really can't do anything else. The doctor just said that... Grandpa... Grandpa might not make it through today..."</p><p>Ge Yang was already sobbing on the other end of the phone.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned without saying a word.</p><p>"Brother Zhu, I've caused you trouble. I'm sorry, I..."</p><p>Ge Yang's heart grew colder and colder, but he didn't blame Zhu Tianlei. After all, the other person had saved him once already. Not asking for repayment was already quite rare, so there was no reason to ask for help again.</p><p>"Where are you?"</p><p>"Brother Zhu, you..."</p><p>Ge Yang thought he must have misunderstood until Zhu Tianlei asked impatiently for a second time. Ge Yang then ecstatically sent his address to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Put on your coat. I heard it might rain in the afternoon!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan took the coat hanging on the back of Zhu Tianlei's chair and handed it to him. Zhu Tianlei felt warmth in his heart; that feeling of being cared for truly wasn't bad.</p><p>"Eat well, wait for me when I get back!"</p><p>"Yes, be careful!"</p><p>The two young men exchanged their final words before Zhu Tianlei left.</p><p>Looking at Zhu Tianlei's tall figure, Ma Lanlan couldn't quite describe her feelings. Zhu Tianlei was destined not to be a bird confined in the depths of the mountains; he was an eagle, and his sky lay beyond the mountains, in the boundless world. And she herself—could she keep up with his pace?</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei arrived at the station, the bus happened to pull up.</p><p>The young man driving the bus was named Tian, just nineteen years old, with rosy lips and white teeth; he would blush whenever he smiled. Zhu Tianlei had a good impression of this young man. Since both trips into town had been driven by Xiao Tian, they could be considered acquaintances. After getting in the car, the two even exchanged a few simple words.</p><p>"Big brother, aren't you going to the villa in Xiamen? It's closer from here!"</p><p>Village buses stopped at each station. The villa in Xiamen that Zhu Tianlei mentioned was still quite far from the end stop. Zhu Tianlei hadn't expected Xiao Tian to be so considerate. Normally, he wouldn't have broken the rules, but today it was a matter of life and death, so he thanked Xiao Tian gratefully before getting out of the car.</p><p>As soon as the car door opened, a silver-gray jeep stopped beside them.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu? I'm here to pick you up as arranged by Young Master Ge Yang!"</p><p>A young man opened the jeep door, his expression respectfully polite.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't overthink it; his strength made him fearless of any danger.</p><p>The jeep sped off and arrived in front of the Cloud Sea City People's Hospital's inpatient department within seven or eight minutes.</p><p>Ge Yang, wearing a white T-shirt, stood at the entrance. Upon seeing Zhu Tianlei get out of the car, he was on the verge of tears with excitement; Zhu Tianlei was his only hope at that moment.</p><p>"Grandpa is in ICU and just underwent another emergency procedure."</p><p>Thinking about the recent emergency scene made Ge Yang's heart ache.</p><p>"Let's go up first!"</p><p>Ge Yang led the way while Zhu Tianlei followed. As they were entering the elevator, a figure brushed past them.</p><p>The figure stood still after Zhu Tianlei had entered the elevator, his eyes glowing with malevolence, like venomous snakes spitting out fangs.</p>

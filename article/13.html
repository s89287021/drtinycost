						<p>Coincidentally, Zhu Tianlei’s face was pressed against Yang Xiaoxue’s chest. The white hem of her dress had been ripped open due to the fall, revealing her pale pink lace bra in full view. The snow-white peaks inside trembled slightly.</p><p>The deep valley directly faced Zhu Tianlei’s mouth.</p><p>There was no point in not taking advantage; what a fool she was!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was certainly no fool. After a moment of admiration, his lips descended into the valley, and an aroma sweeter than flowers instantly filled his mouth.</p><p>"Mmm... you... get up!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue’s face turned beet red as her body became unbearably hot, especially when Zhu Tianlei’s tongue touched her skin; she felt as if her entire body was engulfed in a flame.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was lost in the blissful sensation that felt like being in paradise. His tongue moved freely, exploring every inch of the valley, and Yang Xiaoxue’s sharp command only intensified his excitement.</p><p>The peaks rose and fell, resembling blossoming red flowers, creating such an alluring sight that Zhu Tianlei could no longer hold back, much like a caged beast finally unleashed.</p><p>"Mmm... you this... mmm... let go... me..... mmm..."</p><p>This unfamiliar sensation, filled with both pleasure and pain, desire mixed with chaos, hesitation and torment, left Yang Xiaoxue’s mind in a blur.</p><p>"Excuse me, is Ms. Yang available?"</p><p>Just then, a sudden knock on the door interrupted the impending confrontation inside the room. Yang Xiaoxue paled, Zhu Tianlei felt enraged, but he had no choice but to get up immediately. As a man, his reputation was nothing compared to the dignity of a woman, especially when it came to someone like Yang Xiaoxue, a female teacher who had come to teach.</p><p>The two quickly got off the ground. Yang Xiaoxue hurriedly smoothed out her dress and shot Zhu Tianlei an angry glare.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei paid no heed, raised his eyebrow, and smiled slyly.</p><p>"Come in!"</p><p>As soon as he said that, an eleven or twelve-year-old boy walked in from outside the door, slightly bowing. His clothes were somewhat tattered, and his sandals were small with cracked soles.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but recall his childhood because Zhu Quezi, with his poor leg condition, could not do other jobs to earn money during the off-season like other men in the village. As a result, their family's life was always tight.</p><p>His shoes were always made by Hou Suqin herself who sewed the soles. In summer, he often went barefoot until he was fifteen and finally wore sandals bought from town for the first time.</p><p>"Li Song?"</p><p>"Y...Yao...Teacher Yao, this is a gift we're giving you. We hope Teacher Yao recovers soon and doesn't leave Hamagou!"</p><p>The boy named Li Song said this before taking out a plastic bag from behind him. The plastic bag was bulging, but it was unclear what was inside.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue was about to speak when Li Song placed the plastic bag on the ground and ran away in an instant.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue took a step forward, bent down to pick up the plastic bag, and Zhu Tianlei joined her. Inside the plastic bag were various fruit snacks, including apricot chips, pear chips, plum chips, and peach chips.</p><p>Hamagou was located deep in the mountains with poor transportation conditions, so the children had very few snacks throughout their lives. These fruit snacks were extremely rare.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue picked up a piece of apricot chip, put it in her mouth, and tears streamed down her face. Zhu Tianlei, who was staring at the fruit chips in a trance, was startled to see Yang Xiaoxue's tears and got flustered.</p><p>"Why... why are you crying out of nowhere?"</p><p>"Wuwu... Tianlei, these children are really too adorable; they touched me so much that I felt for the first time that being a teacher is an exceptionally happy thing!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei rolled his eyes. He didn't know what women were made of. Although he had saved her life, she hadn't shown such excitement. However, although he thought this, he couldn't say it out loud.</p><p>"Yes, Hamagou has always been a place of outstanding people and simple folk customs, which is why it has nurtured such adorable children and me, the handsome, incomparable, and charming new generation's excellent youth."</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue was taken aback by Zhu Tianlei's shamelessness and gave him an ugly look again.</p><p>"Alright, I have something to do. Go back first!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue regained her composure. She had been busy all morning, and Yang Dong and the two doctors were still in the village, so she couldn't stay any longer.</p><p>"Mr. Yang, are you really sure about this? You've got my fire going, and now you're ignoring me. I'm still a virgin, and this could easily lead to health issues!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pointed at his pants in frustration, where a small tent stood out prominently, large and imposing.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue's heart, which had just returned to normal, raced again with embarrassment as she grabbed Zhu Tianlei's arm. With unexpected strength, she pushed him outside the door and slammed it shut with a bang.</p><p>Leaning against the door, Yang Xiaoxue's face was flushed like a sunrise. Thinking about what just happened made her heart pound, and an involuntary smile played on her lips.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pouted, looking thoroughly unsatisfied, but the lingering scent of the woman on his tongue brought a glint back to his eyes.</p><p>"Call me Xiaoxue from now on!"</p><p>Hearing the voice from inside the room, Zhu Tianlei grinned until his eyes nearly closed.</p><p>Ha ha, Yang Xiaoxue would be his woman one day!</p><p>When he got home, Zhu Tianlei gave his father another acupuncture session. By the time the needles were removed, Zhu Ciqi could already take steps leaning against the wall.</p><p>They had always thought they would have to walk on half a leg for life, but in their old age, they finally had a chance to walk upright. Both of them were thrilled beyond words, looking at their son with pride that seemed to turn into gold in their eyes.</p><p>Feeling good, Zhu Tianlei ate a few corn cakes and then lay down on the kang in the north room.</p><p>Rural houses faced south with three rooms on either side. The kang Zhu Tianlei was lying on was actually used for storing trash, but he loved this little shed, especially in summer when opening the small window on the north wall let the mountain breeze blow in, making it incredibly comfortable.</p><p>As he blew the wind, images of his morning rescue of Yang Xiaoxue involuntarily appeared in his mind.</p><p>That doctor named Zhao Zhiguo clearly had it out for him, but Zhu Tianlei had never been outside Hama Gou and certainly didn't know any doctors from the city hospital.</p><p>Why would he have it out for him?</p><p>After pondering for a while, Zhu Tianlei still couldn't figure it out and finally concluded that the doctor was jealous of his good looks, youthful vigor, and success, hence his animosity.</p><p>So thinking, he became increasingly cheerful and drifted off to sleep drowsily. He slept so soundly that he didn’t wake up until dusk. When he opened his eyes, the sky was a brilliant crimson, with an abundance of fiery clouds in Hamagou Gully. Zhu Tianlei paid no heed to this.</p><p>Stretching, he staggered out of the door of the north room.</p><p>"Uncle Hu, this is not right!"</p>

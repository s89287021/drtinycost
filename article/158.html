						<p>The car door opened, and four people in police uniforms got out. One of them rushed towards Zhu Tianlei, while the other three formed a surrounding stance.</p><p>"Are you Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>The person at the front spoke up.</p><p>"Yes, I am Zhu Tianlei. I don't know what you all want."</p><p>"Arrest him!"</p><p>This happened too suddenly. The three men suddenly lunged forward, attacking Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>The villagers who followed were stunned. What was happening? Didn't this Zhu kid get named an outstanding youth by the mayor himself? Why is he being arrested now?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood still, coldly looking at the police officer who had just given the order.</p><p>"Are you people working for Qiu Ran?"</p><p>It's no wonder Zhu Tianlei thought so. In his memory, the only police officer who had it in for him was Qiu Ran.</p><p>"Less talk, you killed someone! The higher-ups have directly ordered your arrest; Deputy Director Qiu's word doesn't count!"</p><p>This person was quite straightforward.</p><p>Killed someone again!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but mock himself inwardly.</p><p>It seems this matter is indeed not simple.</p><p>"This is a summons. Come with us!"</p><p>The other party seemed to know what Zhu Tianlei was going to say, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a summons. He waved it in front of Zhu Tianlei's eyes.</p><p>It was a white sheet of paper with black ink writing, bearing Zhu Tianlei's name and stamped with the seal of Yundai Public Security Bureau.</p><p>Seeing his neighbors looking puzzled beside him, and glancing at the tightly closed black painted door behind him, Zhu Tianlei nodded.</p><p>"Since that's the case, let's go!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was also curious. If this incident wasn't carried out by Qiu Ran, then who could it have been?</p><p>His opponents seemed to emerge as rapidly as bamboo shoots after a spring rain, appearing endlessly.</p><p>Watching Zhu Tianlei get into the police car with the officers, the villagers gathered on the sidelines immediately started speculating. The news spread like wings on a bird, quickly reaching the office of Tianlei Pharmaceutical.</p><p>Mao Yu suddenly jumped up from his chair.</p><p>What was Zhu Tianlei stirring up again?</p><p>She had figured out that Zhu Tianlei not only possessed the ability to be an entrepreneur but also had a remarkable talent for causing trouble.</p><p>It hadn't been long at all, and he had already been on TV several times. Was he addicted to giving free advertisements?</p><p>On the other side, Yang Xiaoxue was frantic upon hearing this news, hurriedly calling her father to ask him to investigate what exactly happened.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao, meanwhile, stared blankly out the window at the apricot tree with half its leaves fallen, tears streaming down his face.</p><p>The police car sped along the road.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sat upright in his seat, his eyes closed. He had no interest in finding out more; since he was already in the car, the truth would be revealed soon enough. Why ask unnecessary questions?</p><p>"We've arrived. Get out of the car!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was escorted out of the car by two police officers, holding his arms since it was a summons and not an arrest; thus, no handcuffs were necessary. However, the two officers were extremely cautious, their hands almost never leaving Zhu Tianlei's shoulders. Unbeknownst to them, if Zhu Tianlei really wanted to resist, ten of them wouldn't be enough.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was pushed directly into the interrogation room. However, before the interrogation could begin, the police officer in charge received a phone call and left the room, returning shortly with two additional people following behind him.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The interrogation hadn't even started, yet they were already being moved to another location, which seemed rather peculiar.</p><p>"Where to?"</p><p>"To where you belong!"</p><p>The interrogating officer was a woman with short hair who looked very fair, but her tone and expression were far from pleasant.</p><p>"Where do I belong?"</p><p>"You're wasting too much time. Go where we tell you to go! Move it!"</p><p>While the female police officer's previous demeanor wasn't particularly friendly, at least she had been tolerable. Something about the phone call must have triggered a significant change in her attitude, which now bordered on repulsion.</p><p>"I have the right to know where I'm going."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said calmly.</p><p>"This is a police station, not your warm living room; it's not your turn to speak."</p><p>The female officer was quite domineering.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt that such arrogance in a woman wasn't beneficial. A woman should be gentle and virtuous like his Yuntao, innocent and adorable like Xiaoxue, lively and enthusiastic like Lanlan, alluring and captivating like Xiaomei—definitely not like the female police officer standing before him.</p><p>"I must know where I'm going."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was very persistent.</p><p>The female police officer's face turned red with anger.</p><p>"You two, take the man away now!"</p><p>The female police officer shouted angrily at the two bailiffs.</p><p>The two bailiffs seemed somewhat wary of the female police officer. Despite being of equal rank, they did not show any dissatisfaction towards her imperious orders but immediately cooperated; however,...</p><p>"We can't move him!"</p><p>"Are you two even men......uh......"</p><p>Frustrated, the female police officer decided to do it herself. However, her face soon turned as ugly as that of the bailiffs.</p><p>"I need to know where I'm going; otherwise, you can't do anything to me."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke naturally and calmly.</p><p>"That's nonsense! Hmph!"</p><p>The female police officer was clearly not convinced and tried to push open the door to call for help. However, she was stopped by one of the bailiffs, who whispered something in her ear. The female police officer's face became even uglier, but she stopped walking.</p><p>"Jail."</p><p>The word "jail" slipped out of her mouth.</p><p>"You have presented an arrest warrant; although I don't understand the law, I know that an arrest is for cooperation in an investigation and cannot exceed 24 hours. Now taking me to jail would be against the law, wouldn't it?"</p><p>"Hmph, you offended a big shot and don't even know it. Let me tell you, getting sent to the detention center is the least of your worries."</p><p>The policewoman snorted contemptuously through her nose.</p><p>"Are you sure you want to send me to the detention center?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the policewoman's disdainful expression and asked with a smile.</p><p>"Yes, definitely. Can you leave now?"</p><p>"Very well, I hope when we meet again, you can still be so 'arrogant.'"</p><p>With that said, Zhu Tianlei didn't wait for the two bailiffs to act and walked out of the interrogation room first.</p><p>This time, it only took him about ten minutes to stand in front of the entrance of Cloud Sea City's Second Detention Center.</p><p>The iron gate loomed high, surrounded by metal fences on all sides. The slogan 'Honest Repentance, Contributing to Society' on the white wall was strikingly evident.</p><p>Two bailiffs approached and said a few words; then, the small door beneath the iron gate opened, and Zhu Tianlei was pushed inside.</p><p>This was Zhu Tianlei's first time entering such a place, and it was truly indescribable.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained silent all the way, allowing the two bailiffs to take care of his paperwork until they issued him an orange detention center inmate vest.</p><p>"Go in!"</p><p>After putting on the vest, Zhu Tianlei was led by a detention center officer into a room.</p><p>Iron door, black paint with large letters '309'.</p><p>As soon as Zhu Tianlei walked in, the iron door slammed shut with a whoosh.</p>

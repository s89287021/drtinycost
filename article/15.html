						<p>Never did he expect that Zhu Tianlei had wandered around Black Tiger Forest for seven or eight days, finding nothing but a few common herbs like Zhi Shi, Urtica dioica, Prunella vulgaris, and Chaenomeles sinensis. His initial enthusiasm for starting his own business was significantly dampened.</p><p>That day, Zhu Tianlei returned home as usual with nothing to show for it, dejectedly following the small path. Just as he reached the village entrance, a red sedan nearly knocked him over.</p><p>"How do you drive?"</p><p>Hagou Gou consisted of dirt roads, and after two days of rain, the ground was pitted with mud everywhere. The sudden brake of the sedan splashed mud all over Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Having failed to gather any herbs and now drenched in mud, Zhu Tianlei's anger flared up. He intended to teach the driver a lesson and forcefully slammed his hand on the car hood, causing it to shudder.</p><p>"How do you walk? Are you blind?"</p><p>The car door opened, revealing a young woman dressed in a black business suit.</p><p>Holy crap!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stared at the black-clad beauty before him, nearly losing his marbles. Compared to Chen Guafu's allure, Ma Lanlan's spiciness, and Yang Xiaoxue's innocence, this woman was head and shoulders above them all.</p><p>The woman had a chiseled face with willow leaf eyebrows, sparkling phoenix eyes, and a touch of cinnabar spots at the corners. Her lips were like flames, and though she maintained a stern expression, even with her anger brewing, her face was undeniably captivating. Underneath the black business suit, her figure was slender yet curvaceous, with red stiletto heels peeking out from beneath sheer stockings, standing amidst the mud like an arrogant swan.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei tried to control himself but couldn't help gulping in his saliva.</p><p>Damn, this girl is too perfect. If she were underneath him... Oh my god!</p><p>"Get out of the way! I have important things to do!"</p><p>A black-clad beauty glanced at Zhu Tianlei with disdain and was about to return to the driver's seat.</p><p>"Hey, hey, hey, just because you hit someone do you think you can leave? Don't think you're better than others just because you have a car!"</p><p>This beauty truly did have a face that could make people angry, but her attitude really made one feel uncomfortable. However, Zhu Tianlei's words still carried a hint of jealousy.</p><p>Although the other person wasn't much older than him, it was evident from their clothing and car that they were wealthy and influential, which greatly hurt Zhu Tianlei's pride as a man.</p><p>"Hit someone? Who? You?"</p><p>The beauty had already half-entered the car door and looked at him disdainfully.</p><p>"Besides me, who else would it be?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was genuinely irritated by the beauty's attitude.</p><p>"Oh? Where did you get hit? Arm or leg?"</p><p>Before Zhu Tianlei could speak again, the black-clad beauty took out a few hundred-dollar bills from her wallet, rolled them up with the car's air freshener, and threw it directly into Zhu Tianlei's arms.</p><p>"I still have things to do. If you got hit somewhere, go find a place to get treated!"</p><p>With that, the car door slammed shut. Before Zhu Tianlei could react, the red sedan roared to life, its wheels churning up mud as it shot out of sight in an instant.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the few hundred dollars in his hand and then at the sedan racing into the village, so angry that he felt like choking. He slapped the air freshener-wrapped money into a nearby muddy pit.</p><p>"You little wench, one day I'll pin you down and make you beg for mercy, hmph!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was indeed furious. As a young man full of vigor, being treated this way by a little wench made him wonder if he would die of anger.</p><p>However, these words were merely an outlet for his frustration and fantasies.</p><p>Just as he was about to take a step forward, Zhu Tianlei hesitated again. He walked a few steps and picked up the money he had thrown into the mud pit, then he stomped home with anger boiling inside.</p><p>That little brat was annoying, but the money was innocent. One for one, Zhu Tianlei couldn't afford to hold a grudge against the money, right?</p><p>Since his clothes were drenched with mud and sticky, it made him extremely uncomfortable. As a result, Zhu Tianlei's steps were much larger than usual. In an instant, he reached his front door.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was shocked to find that a red car was parked at the gate of his courtyard.</p><p>After being stunned, Zhu Tianlei didn't have time to think and rushed into the courtyard as if carried by the wind.</p><p>"Miss, my son is really not home. Why don't you wait for him?"</p><p>"Sir, I'm in a hurry. Please help me call him back or even drive over to pick him up..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned; that voice belonged to the black-clad beauty. From the sound of it, she had come to find him!</p><p>At that moment, Zhu Tianlei felt a surge of satisfaction. Although he didn't know why she was looking for him, as long as she needed his help, it proved that he had a chance to make himself look good in front of her.</p><p>"Miss, my son doesn't use a phone. You might want to..."</p><p>"Cough cough, Dad, someone is here?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei cleared his throat and stood up straight, then walked slowly into the room.</p><p>The black-clad beauty turned around at the sound. When she saw Zhu Tianlei, shock spread across her icy-cold face, her phoenix eyes wide as if she had seen a ghost in broad daylight.</p><p>"Huh? What are you doing here?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was pleased with the expression on the other person's face. Hmph, let her turn away from me, let her throw money at me.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei thought to himself, but maintained a mysterious expression on his face.</p><p>"Sir, he...... is he your son?"</p><p>Hao Xinmei turned around in disbelief and asked Zhu Quezi.</p><p>It's impossible, absolutely impossible. Legend has it that Zhu Tianlei was an exceptional physician, capable of reviving the dead. How could such a great doctor be a street thug demanding compensation for a hit-and-run accident? Impossible!</p><p>"Tianlei, what on earth happened to you? Why are you covered in mud?"</p><p>Upon seeing his beloved son covered head to toe in mud, Zhu Quezi felt immense pain and didn't pay close attention to Hao Xinmei's words.</p><p>"Ask her!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pursed his lips and glanced at Hao Xinmei standing in the middle of the room.</p><p>Zhu Quezi looked at Hao Xinmei in astonishment, feeling bewildered.</p><p>Hao Xinmei hadn't expected that the legendary doctor she was looking for would turn out to be a street thug right before her eyes. She felt momentarily lost and extremely embarrassed.</p><p>"Doctor...... Doctor Zhu, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were Doctor Zhu earlier. Please forgive me for any inconvenience I caused!"</p><p>Despite feeling embarrassed, Hao Xinmei, as a businesswoman who had been in the commercial world since she was sixteen, quickly regained her composure due to her excellent temperament and high emotional intelligence.</p><p>"What you're saying doesn't sound very nice. Are you suggesting that hitting someone with a car depends on who they are? If I weren't the person you were looking for, would it not be my fault?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was extremely dissatisfied with Hao Xinmei's apology, finding no sincerity in it at all!</p><p>"You......"</p><p>Hao Xinmei's face turned pale after hearing Zhu Tianlei's words. At sixteen, she had started her business career and had encountered every kind of person. But no one had ever been so unyielding towards her.</p><p>"How about me? What I said isn't a fact?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was saying as he slowly walked to the water jug in the room, picking up the gourd scoop and gulping down cold water.</p><p>Hao Xinmei clenched her fists tightly, her nails almost sinking into her flesh.</p><p>"I'll endure!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei gritted her teeth inwardly, but her expression softened.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu is kind-hearted and benevolent; he naturally wouldn't quarrel with a woman like me. I came today because I have something important to request. As long as Doctor Zhu can cure my son, no matter what conditions you set, I'll agree!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei heard this and inwardly cursed, not expecting that this young-looking girl with such a good figure was already a mother!</p><p>Forget it, pity all parents' hearts; since it's for her child, he would temporarily overlook it.</p><p>"Don't flatter me. I'm not as noble as you say, but I wouldn't let someone die either. Tell me, where is the child? How do we go?"</p><p>Hao Xinmei had thought she would have to argue further, but Zhu Tianlei changed his mind so quickly that she was surprised again, although her heart was at ease.</p><p>"He's in the car. I'll carry him out!"</p><p>After saying this, Hao Xinmei hurriedly walked towards the carriage.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the still confused Zhu Quezi and comforted his father a few times. Zhu Quezi knew his son would act with discretion and didn't plan to interfere, turning around to head back to the southern room.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stared at Hao Xinmei's constantly wriggling bottom, feeling regret time and again. Alas, such a beautiful woman was already someone else's, it truly pained him!</p><p>However, when he saw the son in Hao Xinmei's arms, all his emotions turned into two words.</p><p>"Shit!"</p>

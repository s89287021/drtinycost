						<p>Zhang Qiang looked at Zhu Tianlei and was taken aback. The two of them had not spoken a word since Team Captain Qi left, and this was the first thing they were saying to each other.</p><p>"Don't bother with it."</p><p>"I'll use my phone if I want to! Dial whoever you like!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei threw his phone onto Zhang Qiang's bed, then got up and walked out of the room, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>Zhang Qiang's expression was complex as he stared at the phone for a long time before finally picking it up.</p><p>"What? What did you say...?"</p><p>Hearing the scream from inside, Zhu Tianlei immediately burst into the room to see Zhang Qiang violently pulling out the needle from his arm and struggling to get out of bed, disregarding his injured leg.</p><p>"Zhang Qiang, what are you doing? Don't you want this leg anymore?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was shocked and somewhat enraged; Zhang Qiang really knew how to cause trouble.</p><p>"It's none of your business! I want to go home. Let me go!"</p><p>"Doctor! Doctor!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shouted. Soon, two people ran into the room.</p><p>"The patient is agitated. Do we have any sedatives? Inject him with one!"</p><p>"Oh oh oh oh!"</p><p>The incoming doctor was not very old; seeing Zhang Qiang's pale face and bloodshot eyes, looking like he was possessed by a demon, he panicked and did not bother to consult the main physician. He hurriedly took the sedative and, with Zhu Tianlei's help, directly injected it into Zhang Qiang.</p><p>Zhang Qiang looked at Zhu Tianlei, momentarily stunned. The two of them had been silent ever since Team Captain Qi left, making this their first exchange.</p><p>"Don’t bother."</p><p>"I’ll use my phone if I want to! Dial whoever you like!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei tossed his phone onto Zhang Qiang's bed and then got up, leaving the room and closing the door behind him with a slam.</p><p>Zhang Qiang’s expression was complex as he stared at the phone for a long time before finally picking it up.</p><p>"What? What did you say…?"</p><p>Hearing the scream inside, Zhu Tianlei rushed in to find Zhang Qiang violently yanking out the needle from his arm and struggling to get out of bed, completely ignoring his injured leg.</p><p>"Zhang Qiang, what are you doing? Don’t you want this leg anymore?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was shocked and somewhat angry; Zhang Qiang really knew how to cause trouble.</p><p>"It’s none of your business! I want to go home. Let me go!"</p><p>By now, Zhang Qiang's emotions were out of control, and even Zhu Tianlei struggled to restrain him.</p><p>"Doctor! Doctor!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shouted. Moments later, two people rushed in.</p><p>"The patient is agitated. Do we have any sedatives? Inject him with one!"</p><p>"Oh oh oh oh!"</p><p>The doctor was young and panicked upon seeing Zhang Qiang’s pale face and bloodshot eyes, looking possessed by a demon. He did not bother consulting the main physician and hurriedly took the sedative, injecting it into Zhang Qiang with Zhu Tianlei's help.</p><p>Zhang Qiang stared at Zhu Tianlei, momentarily stunned. The two of them had been silent since Team Captain Qi left, making this their first exchange.</p><p>"Don’t bother."</p><p>“I’ll use my phone if I want to!

He did not bother consulting the main physician and hurriedly took the sedative, injecting it into Zhang Qiang with Zhu Tianlei's help.</p><p>Ten minutes later, the agitated Zhang Qiang finally calmed down slowly, and Zhu Tianlei also heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>"You keep squirming around, and you'll spend the rest of your life in bed!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was indeed very angry, and his tone wasn't pleasant either.</p><p>At that moment, the phone that Zhang Qiang had thrown aside suddenly rang. Zhang Qiang instinctively picked up the phone, and Zhu Tianlei didn't stop him.</p><p>"What? You're telling me it's true?"</p><p>Zhang Qiang's emotions flared up again. Even though he had been injected with a sedative, it couldn't completely calm him down; however, compared to before, he was indeed much milder.</p><p>He put down the phone and looked at Zhu Tianlei, hesitating to speak.</p><p>"Say something. As long as I can help, I won't just stand by."</p><p>Zhang Qiang hesitated for a moment...</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei borrowed a stretcher from the nurses' station, Zhang Qiang was already eager to sit on the bed. Zhu Tianlei picked up Zhang Qiang and placed him on the stretcher.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pushed the stretcher directly into the waiting room. Zhang Qiang looked very anxious, looking around but refusing to say what he was looking for.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, I finally found you! That old woman is causing trouble again, insisting on finding her son. Look..."</p><p>A young doctor, whom they had met briefly in the emergency room, ran over from a distance and seemed excited to see Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Now, Zhu Tianlei had become a legend in their department. Almost everyone admired Zhu Tianlei, even falling in love with him, including this young doctor.</p><p>"Really? I'll go take a look..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei asked Zhang Qiang if he wanted to come, but Zhang Qiang said he didn't want to and would stay in the waiting room. Zhu Tianlei was about to leave when he remembered Zhang Qiang's previous behavior and couldn't help but be concerned. He decided not to heed Zhang Qiang's reluctance and pushed the stretcher with him to a ward next to the emergency room.</p><p>"My son, my son! Where is my son? You people must have hidden him somewhere!"</p><p>In the ward, Old Lady Niu's voice was incredibly loud, piercing through everyone's eardrums.</p><p>"Grandma, we've already looked for him. Your son will be here soon. Please take your medicine, okay?"</p><p>"I won't take any medicine; I want my son......"</p><p>All the doctors and nurses in the room were at a loss, their heads sweating profusely but unable to find a solution as they couldn't get through to the director's phone.</p><p>"Mom, I'm here! You have to take your medicine. Not taking it would break my heart!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei parked the stretcher outside and approached Old Lady Niu with a beaming smile and gentle words.</p><p>"My son, he's come!"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei, Old Lady Niu immediately burst into joy, dancing about wildly. All the doctors and nurses seemed to see an angel of salvation.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sat beside Old Lady Niu, smiling and coaxing her to take the medicine slowly, spoon by spoon. He then carefully wiped away any remaining medicine from her mouth.</p><p>All medical staff were moved to tears; it was the most unforgettable day of their careers, more vivid and inspiring than any ethics or skills training class they had ever attended.</p><p>Having calmed Old Lady Niu down, Zhu Tianlei turned his head only to see Zhang Qiang sobbing on the stretcher. Upon seeing Zhu Tianlei, he covered his face and burst into sobs.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned, genuinely puzzled by Zhang Qiang's behavior. Could it be due to pain from the injury? However, throughout the entire process of bandaging and administering medicine, Zhang Qiang hadn't even flinched once.</p><p>"Zhang Qiang, what's wrong with you?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei approached him patiently.</p><p>"Boss, I'm not a human being! I don't deserve it. I'm not a human!"</p><p>"My son, my son! Where is my son? You people must have hidden him somewhere!"</p><p>In the ward, Old Lady Niu's voice was incredibly loud, piercing through everyone's eardrums.</p><p>"Grandma, we've already looked for him. Your son will be here soon. Please take your medicine, okay?"</p><p>"I won't take any medicine; I want my son......"</p><p>All the doctors and nurses in the room were at a loss, their heads sweating profusely but unable to find a solution as they couldn't get through to the director's phone.</p><p>"Mom, I'm here!

I don't deserve it. I'm not a human!"</p><p>"Where is my son? My son, where are you hidden?"</p><p>In the ward, Old Lady Niu's voice boomed loudly, echoing through the room.</p><p>"Grandma, we have already looked for him. Your son will be here shortly. Please take your medicine, okay?"</p><p>"I won't take any medicine; I want my son......"</p><p>The doctors and nurses in the room were at a loss, their brows furrowed with concern as they sweated profusely but found no solution, unable to reach the director.</p><p>"Mother, I'm here! You must take your medicine. Not doing so would break my heart!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei parked the stretcher outside and approached Old Lady Niu with a beaming smile and gentle words.</p><p>"My son is here!"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei, Old Lady Niu's face lit up with joy, and she began to dance wildly. The doctors and nurses looked at him as if he were an angel sent from heaven.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sat beside Old Lady Niu, smiling softly and coaxing her to take the medicine slowly, spoon by spoon. He then carefully wiped away any remaining medicine from her mouth.</p><p>All the medical staff were moved to tears; it was the most unforgettable day of their careers, more vivid and inspiring than any ethics or skills training class they had ever attended.</p><p>Having calmed Old Lady Niu, Zhu Tianlei turned his head to see Zhang Qiang sobbing on the stretcher. Upon seeing him, Zhang Qiang covered his face and wept loudly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned, genuinely puzzled by Zhang Qiang's behavior. Could it be due to pain from the injury? However, throughout the entire process of bandaging and administering medicine, Zhang Qiang hadn't even flinched once.</p><p>"Zhang Qiang, what is wrong with you?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei approached him patiently.</p><p>"Boss, I am not a human being! I do not deserve it. I am not a human!"</p><p>Zhang Qiang suddenly raised his hand, slapping himself across the face twice. Just as he was about to strike again, Zhu Tianlei grabbed him by the arm.</p><p>"Zhang Qiang, a manly fellow like you, should speak your mind. What does it mean to cry and whine?"</p><p>There was an underlying suspicion in Zhu Tianlei's heart, but it seemed unlikely.</p><p>"Boss, the person in the ward is my mom, my mother!"</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hadn't expected things to turn out this way. This could be called hitting the bullseye by accident, or fate having its own plan?</p><p>Old Lady Niu stirred and fell back asleep. Zhu Tianlei sighed and informed the emergency room staff to help transfer Zhang Qiang and Old Lady Niu to a single ward.</p><p>"Alright, stop talking about it. Just go to sleep. Grandma is still weak after going through all this today. I've brought your phone back; call me if you need anything!"</p><p>Seeing Zhang Qiang's shamefaced expression, his face red with restrained emotion, Zhu Tianlei waved goodbye and left the ward.</p><p>That night, Zhu Tianlei slept on a long chair outside the ward. Fortunately, the weather was neither too cold nor too hot, so he slept well.</p><p>"Boss, I've truthfully reported the situation to the Administration for Industry and Commerce and the Labor Bureau. I only did this terrible thing because someone paid me. No matter how you punish me, I, Zhang Qiang, will accept it!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had just stepped in when Zhang Qiang, looking haggard, started speaking.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but feel a wave of emotion. He knew why Zhang Qiang had chosen this path, even though it was wrong, it was driven by filial piety. How could someone who respected their parents be considered evil?</p><p>"Don't overthink it. Focus on getting well. Don't worry about the costs; I'll cover everything. Also, I've examined Grandma and will prescribe a few medications later. While I can't guarantee that she'll fully recover, she should recognize people and take care of herself."</p><p>Zhang Qiang looked at Zhu Tianlei, his eyes welling up with tears again.</p>

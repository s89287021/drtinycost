						<p>A speech from a middle-aged man made the crowded venue instantly fall silent.</p><p>"What? Illegal production?"</p><p>One of the clients who had come from out of town quickly walked a few steps forward and asked loudly, his voice not even slightly inferior to that of someone using a megaphone.</p><p>"Yes, our duty as the Food and Drug Administration is to protect consumer rights, ensure food and drug safety, regulate the food and drug market, so we will absolutely not tolerate any irregularities from food and drug companies."</p><p>The middle-aged man spoke with passion and righteousness.</p><p>After the middle-aged man finished speaking, the venue erupted again. Some even returned to the signing table, demanding their agreements be invalidated.</p><p>Markets are fickle; even established pharmaceutical companies could be abandoned by the market overnight, let alone a newly founded one. They dared not take such risks.</p><p>Of course, some were watching and hoping for the best, given that the sales of Beauty Pill were truly tempting and itchy to think about.</p><p>"Where is the company's head, Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>The middle-aged man was quite satisfied with the crowd's reactions at the meeting, but so far, the main character of this incident had not appeared. It felt like he was performing a solo act.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood in the corner by the entrance throughout, standing next to Hao Xinmei, his smile unclear. Even Hao Xinmei found it strange; at this point, shouldn't Zhu Tianlei be trying to stop that person from speaking?</p><p>The business conference had gathered almost half of the pharmaceutical industry's distributors. If this matter were to spread out, even if it turned out later that the accusations were baseless, the impact on Tianlei Pharmaceuticals would be incalculable.</p><p>Was it because Zhu Tianlei was too young or inexperienced and hadn't thought about these things?</p><p>"Stupid girl, so anxious?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei secretly pinched Hao Xinmei's cute bottom and asked teasingly.</p><p>Hao Xinmei glared at Zhu Tianlei without a good mood. What time was it? They still had time for flirtation.</p><p>"Shut up, they’re going to pour sewage all over you. How can you not be anxious?"</p><p>"Sewage? Little Mei, as the president of a major company, why does it sound so crude when you say these two words?"</p><p>Hao Xinhui’s pretty face turned red with anger at Zhu Tianlei’s carefree demeanor.</p><p>"Alright, don’t worry, he wants to pour sewage on me, but he’s still not ready."</p><p>After saying that, without waiting for Hao Xinhui to react, he walked towards the middle-aged man. Hao Xinhui was about to follow him but hesitated for a moment before staying put.</p><p>"Hello, I am Zhu Tianlei, the legal representative of Tianlei Pharmaceuticals."</p><p>The middle-aged man looked at Zhu Tianlei standing in front of him and felt momentarily surprised. This person is too young, and he seems a bit unruly. Could this really be that outstanding youth mentioned in the city?</p><p>"Cough cough... We have received a report..."</p><p>Before the middle-aged man could finish speaking, Zhu Tianlei laughed. With one laugh, all the wildflowers on the mountain blushed.</p><p>The middle-aged man was stunned and didn’t understand what Zhu Tianlei meant.</p><p>"Didn’t you guys come to verify the report? Please!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei ignored the middle-aged man and politely gestured for him to enter. At the same time, a young gentleman in reception attire, wearing a ribbon, led several people into the factory with graceful strides.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei maintained a smile throughout, as warm as spring breezes.</p><p>The middle-aged man felt inexplicably uneasy.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, the dealers who had been standing still and hesitating immediately followed him. There was no point in not watching a spectacle.</p><p>The middle-aged man's footsteps involuntarily faltered.</p><p>Having immersed himself in officialdom for decades, his eyes could be said to read people like an open book; it was impossible for anyone to play tricks on him.</p><p>But now, he couldn't figure out what Zhu Tianlei was thinking. Was he stupid?</p><p>"Please change into dust coats."</p><p>Several staff members pushed over two enormous cardboard boxes filled with unopened disposable dust coats.</p><p>The middle-aged man's brow slightly furrowed, indicating that the other party had been well-prepared. However, that was impossible; absolutely impossible.</p><p>Seeing the spacious and bright factory, brand new automated equipment, all self-cleaning areas, storage zones clearly visible, and even the aseptic test chambers in plain sight, the following dealers couldn't help but marvel.</p><p>The middle-aged man's expression became increasingly grim.</p><p>"Oh, by the way, I haven't known how to address you."</p><p>Seeing the middle-aged man's expression, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but sneer inwardly, although his smile remained unchanged on his face.</p><p>"My name is Mu. Mu Kun."</p><p>"Oh, oh, so it's Director Mu. Long admired."</p><p>Mu Kun looked at Zhu Tianlei strangely; he had only been appointed deputy director of the Food and Drug Administration a week ago, so how did the other party know his position?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words were truly piercing, especially the phrase "fair and just," which was clearly insinuating something. However, before Mu Kun became an associate director at the Food and Drug Administration, he was with the County Public Security Inspection Office, where he had a domineering and tough personality. Zhu Tianlei's words only seemed to irritate him even more.</p><p>"That's for sure; we will not ignore any reports and will definitely not tolerate or condone those companies or individuals involved in illegal production and operation," Mu Kun said, his teeth nearly clenched.</p><p>The second half of the sentence was filled with barely suppressed anger.</p><p>"Director Mu is truly dedicated to serving the people and diligent in his official duties. Jianxiong, just follow Director Mu's instructions. Remember to strictly adhere to his arrangements."</p><p>Yao Jianxiong, who had been standing by all along, stepped forward as soon as he heard this, nodded solemnly, then stood upright like a sentinel, staring unblinkingly at Mu Kun.</p><p>"Please give us your instructions, Director Mu."</p><p>Ugh.</p><p>Mu Kun felt somewhat embarrassed by Yao Jianxiong's actions and upon seeing the intense gazes of the hundred or so people around him, he realized that today was indeed challenging for him.</p><p>"I need to conduct random inspections on the production records of the latest batch of drugs, as well as the inventory of drugs and your raw material warehouse."</p><p>Mu Kun straightened his expression, returning to his previously serious demeanor, his face stern without a hint of a smile.</p><p>"Right this way, Director Mu."</p><p>Yao Jianxiong was indeed very cooperative. No sooner had Mu Kun finished speaking than he took large strides, leading the group towards the warehouse.</p><p>"This is our finished goods warehouse, and this is our raw material warehouse. The production records will be sent over shortly."</p><p>The warehouses and raw material storage of Tianlei Pharmaceutical were built together. Mu Kun pointed with his hand, and those accompanying him split into two groups, entering the warehouse and raw material storage.</p><p>"Director Mu! We've found it!"</p>

						<p>Incoherent and lewd words kept emanating from the phone, causing everyone standing in the corridor to gape in shock. They couldn't imagine that all this was orchestrated by the vice president of the hospital, nor did they expect that Qixuehua, who had always been conservative, would actually engage in an affair, and to such an extent...</p><p>Qixuehua stood dazed in place, her mind blank. This was something she had planned to use one day to force Zhao Zhiguo into submission, but she never thought it would be exposed by Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Qixuehua's entire body trembled, and suddenly, her legs gave out as she collapsed onto the ground with a thud.</p><p>Chou Ran was drenched in cold sweat; he was genuinely afraid. Zhu Tianlei was too powerful, and Chou Ran wasn't his match.</p><p>"Is Chairman Chou leaving?"</p><p>"Oh, it seems to be a misunderstanding. I have a meeting to attend this afternoon, so I'll leave now!"</p><p>Chou Ran wished he could grow wings and fly away immediately. Only by getting away from Zhu Tianlei could he feel safe.</p><p>"Chairman Chou previously said that the law is omnipresent and lenient but not lax. Now, I'm being falsely accused with concrete evidence. Does Chairman Chou not plan to uphold justice for the people?"</p><p>Chou Ran felt his head spin.</p><p>No matter how deeply he investigated this matter, the result would be disastrous. Qixuehua was no one to provoke.</p><p>"Cough cough... Vice President Qi is from the County Hospital, and her mistakes should be handled by the County Hospital itself. We in the police force have no position to intervene. I'll leave now!"</p><p>After Chou Ran spoke, he didn't dare stay any longer. With his tail between his legs, he led his subordinates away like the wind.</p><p>"President Song, the phone is yours. This is your hospital's private affair, and I won't interfere. I trust that President Song will handle it fairly!"</p><p>Song Bini took the phone from Zhu Tianlei with a complex expression. He had been in the position of president for twenty years but had never encountered such an issue before. It was his fault for misjudging people; he originally thought that although Qixuehua was ambitious, she had strong professional skills and could bring a different future to the hospital. That's why he promoted her despite hurting his student's feelings, but...</p><p>"Xiaoyu, when is your dad coming?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei no longer paid attention to Song Bini; this was their hospital's business. If Song Bini wanted to cover up for this rogue horse, the County Hospital would be condemned by all eventually. For a physician, if one cannot have compassion in their heart, their medical skills will never reach great heights.</p><p>"It's about time!"</p><p>Hearing Feng Xiaoyu's words, Pang Lanteng stood up abruptly and was about to leave when Zhu Tianlei gently pushed him back into his chair.</p><p>"Family reunion, you can't afford to be absent!"</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, footsteps sounded from the end of the corridor. A short, somewhat frail middle-aged man rushed over hurriedly.</p><p>Feng Xiaoyu's eyes turned red, and she instantly threw herself into her father's arms.</p><p>"Dad, wuwu......"</p><p>"Good daughter, good daughter, you've been wronged, it's all my fault, it's my mistake......"</p><p>Looking at his daughter in front of him, Father Feng's heart ached, his eyes welling up with tears. He blamed himself repeatedly, and the simple face was filled with deep paternal love.</p><p>"You vicious woman, actually wanting to harm Xiaoyu! I'll kill you, I'll kill you!"</p><p>After comforting his daughter for a while, Father Feng noticed Pang Lan, who kept shrinking back in an attempt to dodge him, and lunged at her, giving her a slap.</p><p>No one felt sorry for her; they only relished the satisfaction!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei silently returned to the ward, took out his belongings, and was about to leave.</p><p>"Young man!"</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei stepped out of the ward and raised his foot to leave, Song Binian called him back.</p><p>"President Song, is there anything else?"</p><p>Song Binian had quickly regained his composure. The event that just happened had a great impact on him; he felt he still hadn't clarified enough questions. Most importantly, facing Zhu Tianlei, whose medical skills were so profound, his heart of love made him unable to bear the idea of letting go of such a medical genius.</p><p>"It's about time!"</p><p>Hearing Feng Xiaoyu’s words, Pang Lanteng stood up abruptly and was about to leave when Zhu Tianlei gently pushed him back into his chair.</p><p>"A family reunion, your absence is not ideal!"</p><p>As soon as Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, footsteps echoed from the end of the corridor. A short, somewhat frail middle-aged man rushed over hurriedly.</p><p>Feng Xiaoyu’s eyes turned red, and she instantly threw herself into her father's arms.</p><p>"Dad, wuwu......"</p><p>"Good daughter, good daughter, you've been wronged, it's my fault, my mistake......"</p><p>Looking at his daughter in front of him, Father Feng's heart ached, his eyes welling up with tears.

A short, somewhat frail middle-aged man rushed over hurriedly.</p><p>Feng Xiaoyu’s eyes filled with tears, and she instantly threw herself into her father's arms.</p><p>"Dad, wuwu......"</p><p>"Good daughter, good daughter, you've been wronged; it's all my fault, my mistake......"</p><p>Looking at his daughter in front of him, Father Feng’s heart ached, his eyes brimming with tears. He berated himself repeatedly, and the simple face was suffused with deep paternal love.</p><p>"You vicious woman, actually wanting to harm Xiaoyu! I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you!"</p><p>After comforting his daughter for a while, Father Feng noticed Pang Lan, who kept shrinking back in an attempt to dodge him, and lunged at her, giving her a sharp slap.</p><p>No one felt sorry for her; they only relished the satisfaction!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei silently returned to the ward, took out his belongings, and was about to leave.</p><p>"Young man!"</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei stepped out of the ward and raised his foot to leave, Song Binian called him back.</p><p>"President Song, is there anything else?"</p><p>Song Binian had quickly regained his composure. The event that just happened had a great impact on him; he felt he still hadn't clarified enough questions. Most importantly, facing Zhu Tianlei, whose medical skills were so profound, his heart of love made it impossible for him to bear the idea of letting go of such a medical genius.</p><p>"Boy, something happened at the county hospital, and as the director, I cannot escape my responsibility. This incident shows that there are significant loopholes and drawbacks in our selection, employment, and management practices. Therefore, on behalf of the hospital, I apologize to you for today's events!"</p><p>After Song Baian finished speaking, he bowed deeply towards Zhu Tianlei. Yang Hua followed suit by bending down and bowing. Then, all the medical staff standing in the corridor bowed deeply towards Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>This scene left Zhu Tianlei somewhat stunned. The anger he had felt from being misunderstood, the indignation at the medical staff's lack of morality, and the frustration with the county hospital leadership's inaction had all dissipated along with these bowing figures.</p><p>These were Zhu Tianlei's heartfelt words, devoid of any falsehood.</p><p>"No, Doctor Zhu, you are a model for all our medical staff. When we first stepped into the medical field after graduating from school, each of us had the intention to save lives and heal wounds, and grand dreams of benefiting humanity. However, as we grow older and experience more things, we have been chained by power, money, and fame, losing sight of who we were in our youth. Today, you have given us a vivid lesson, reminding us of our dedication and resolve when we chose to become doctors!"</p><p>A doctor in his thirties, wearing a mask and stethoscope, spoke emotionally.</p><p>Others chimed in, each word Zhu Tianlei said was a shock and cleansing to their souls.</p><p>"Yes, Doctor Zhu, modern medical technology is advancing rapidly, but there are fewer and fewer doctors with true compassion and skills. You are the epitome of an excellent doctor. As Director Song Baian, I sincerely hope that you will join us as part of the People's Hospital."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was startled. What situation was this?</p><p>Just moments ago, he had been caught in a pincer attack, seemingly on the brink of death, and now he was suddenly considered precious. The county hospital and village clinic were completely different concepts, and this invitation differed from Li Yong's initial offer as it came from the director of the People's Hospital.</p><p>"Tianlei, just agree!"</p><p>"Yes, Uncle, you are so amazing; stay with us!"</p><p>...</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was not unmoved, but after a brief hesitation, he shook his head.</p><p>"I felt the deep friendship of President Song, but my roots are not here; the people in Hama Gou need me more than this place!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't say that his beloved wife was in Hama Gou, or he wouldn't have come here to become a monk!</p><p>Song Biniu tried to persuade him for a few more words, but Zhu Tianlei remained unmoved. Helpless, he could only give up, though his heart ached from losing such talent.</p><p>Yang Hua saw Zhu Tianlei off all the way to the door.</p><p>"Tianlei, what illness did Little Yu get? How did you know that her stepmother had given her medicine?"</p>

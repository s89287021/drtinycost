						<p>Zhu Tianlei searched the courtyard, but Hao Xinmei and the dog Hua Rong seemed to have vanished into thin air.</p><p>"Could that little girl be playing a trick on me?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt as if he had been doused with cold water from head to toe; his initial enthusiasm was gone in an instant.</p><p>Sitting dejectedly on the stone steps in the courtyard, watching the sky turn overcast, Zhu Tianlei, who had previously felt that his life was about to begin a glorious chapter, couldn't help but sigh deeply.</p><p>"Quick, look! They're fighting! Someone might get hurt..."</p><p>Suddenly, a voice came from outside the courtyard wall, followed by hurried footsteps.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood up, and Zhu Quezi and Hou Suqin quickly emerged from the house. The three of them looked at each other and then simultaneously ran towards the gate of the courtyard.</p><p>For some reason, Zhu Tianlei felt anxious, as if something was about to happen.</p><p>Following the direction of the sound, the trio rushed to the village entrance. Zhu Tianlei's heart raced, his feet moving like the wind, and he didn't even bother looking after Zhu Quezi and Hou Suqin, dashing straight for the village entrance.</p><p>At the village entrance, villagers had formed a large circle, three layers deep inside and out, obscuring everything happening within.</p><p>"Little bitch, you stole my money and think you can escape? Think again!"</p><p>A coarse curse echoed from within the crowd.</p><p>"Sunjiang, let me go! If you don't let me go, I'll call the police!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's eyebrows twitched; that voice was clearly the ice princess's. Upon realizing this, he pushed through the crowd without hesitation and squeezed to the front.</p><p>Sure enough, the ice princess was hugging Hua Rong while crouching on the ground, but her arm was grabbed by a middle-aged man in a dark blue suit.</p><p>The middle-aged man had a square face, thick eyebrows, and a wide mouth. He had very little hair, slightly balding, with an eye-catching gold chain around his neck about as thick as a pinky finger.</p><p>Behind him stood two men wearing camouflage t-shirts, leaning on each other. Although they made no move, it was clear that they were there to back up this middle-aged man.</p><p>"Call the police? Go ahead, the entrance of the Criminal Investigation Team is right in front of my family’s gate! Little tramp, let me tell you clearly, if you go with me quietly, everything will be fine. Otherwise, don’t blame me, Sun Jiang, for not showing mercy!"</p><p>Sun Jiang was not tall but built. His grip on Hao Xinhui’s arm was like that of a tiger’s claw.</p><p>"Sun Jiang, wins and losses in business are common occurrences. Your investment failure is due to your own poor judgment and has nothing to do with me, Hao Xinhui. I overlook it because the old Sun General once recognized my talent. Don’t push your luck!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Hao Xinhui and couldn’t help but raise his thumb in admiration. This little minx could keep her composure under pressure; besides her stunning looks, few women in the world could match this kind of bearing!</p><p>"Pushing my luck? Haha, alright, then let me show you what pushing luck means!"</p><p>After Sun Jiang finished speaking, his hands suddenly went for Hao Xinhui’s collar. Hao Xinhui instinctively tried to protect Hua Rong in her arms, and the collar was ripped open with a loud sound, exposing her snow-white neck and half of her skin.</p><p>"Little bitch, let me see how you act so high and mighty!"</p><p>Despite Hao Xinhui’s good mental fortitude, she couldn’t bear being publicly humiliated and tears streamed down her face as she struggled to free herself.</p><p>Surprisingly, none of the villagers around wanted to help her.</p><p>Perhaps that was why Sun Jiang dared to be wanton and arrogant.</p><p>Sun Jiang looked at Hao Xinhui, who resembled a noble swan, now looking so pathetic in front of him. He felt an abnormal satisfaction and became even more frenzied, reaching out again to tear open the blouse under Hao Xinhui’s suit.</p><p>"Brat, mind your own business!"</p><p>Just as Sun Jiang was about to touch Hao Xinhui’s clothes again, his wrist was suddenly grabbed by someone. He looked up and saw Zhu Tianlei holding him back.</p><p>A young punk in his early twenties; nothing to worry about. Sun Jiang barely glanced at Zhu Tianlei before dismissing him with a warning.</p><p>"Mind your own business? I don’t think so. Miss Hao is my patient, and you’re assaulting my patient. Is that what you call minding your own business?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke with a faint smile, his lips curling in a manner that was both amiable and sinister, leaving people puzzled.</p><p>"Spit it out, do you take me for a three-year-old? You're just some peasant brat, a sickly one at that. I think you've got more mental issues than anyone! A psychiatric patient! Get the hell out of my way!"</p><p>Sun Jiang was full of profanity, cursing as if he were a machine gun spitting bullets, without any hesitation.</p><p>"Do you want me to get out of your way? Sure, kneel down and apologize to Miss Hao. When she forgives you, I'll leave!"</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei's words faded, the onlookers in the village began whispering and discussing among themselves, of course not saying anything nice. The most common topic was how Zhu Tianlei was acting like a dog catching rats, overestimating himself.</p><p>Ma Lanlan, who had just rushed over after hearing the news, was both angry and anxious upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words. She was furious because Zhu Tianlei was clearly speaking up for that woman and even risking his own life. She was anxious because if Zhu Tianlei really got into a fight, he would definitely come out worse.</p><p>Both Zhu Tianlei and Ma Lanlan were natives of Toad Gully Village. From childhood to adulthood, they had never seen Zhu Tianlei win any fights with anyone.</p><p>Hao Xinmei looked at Zhu Tianlei in slight shock; she did not expect this boy who had been giving her trouble since she first entered the village to step forward at this moment.</p><p>However... Sun Jiang was a notorious hoodlum in Yunhai City, his hands stained with blood, and his nephew was the captain of the Criminal Investigation Team with several subordinates. Although Zhu Tianlei meant well, Hao Xinmei did not want him to risk his life because of her.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, I can handle this myself; don't get involved!"</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>Upon hearing Hao Xinmei's words, Zhu Tianlei was so angry he almost spit blood out. So in Hao Xinmei's eyes, he Zhu Tianlei was just an overbearing busybody?</p><p>"Haha, brat, did you hear that? This little girl is telling you not to interfere. You'd better stop showing your hot face to her cold butt and get lost!"</p><p>Sun Jiang laughed maniacally, his blood-red gums revealing a row of large yellow teeth from his lips, while the other hand reached for Hao Xinmei's chest again.</p><p>"Get over here!"</p><p>"Aaaah... brat, I think you must be out of your mind. You two come at me; beat me to death and Brother Sun will give you a hefty reward!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was seething with anger. Despite his kind intentions, Hao Xinmei did not appreciate them, and now this short and squat Sun Jiang was mocking him viciously. He could no longer contain his rage and twisted his right hand to snap Sun Jiang's wrist.</p><p>Seeing the two men in camouflage shirts beside Sun Jiang dart forward, Hao Xinmei's breaths grew tense and almost stopped.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, hurry up and leave! Hurry!"</p><p>Not only was Zhu Tianlei unable to move at that moment, but even if he wanted to, hearing Hao Xinmei's worried cries made it impossible for him to do so.</p><p>"Heh heh, you care about me?"</p>

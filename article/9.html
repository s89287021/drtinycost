						<p>Zhu Tianlei opened his eyes, and the qi ball in his dantian not only failed to disappear but seemed to have become part of his body. Zhu Tianlei stood up and discovered that his vision could actually penetrate more than a hundred meters in depth, directly seeing the entrance of the cave.</p><p>He got up, stretched his muscles, and something even more bizarre happened— he felt as if he had grown much stronger; the luster of his skin was not at all dull even inside the cave.</p><p>It truly made one marvel.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei realized that this gourd cave was really a treasure land for him. It seemed that he should visit this cave more often in the future.</p><p>Smiling, Zhu Tianlei walked out of the mountain cave with large strides.</p><p>It was high noon, and strong sunlight penetrated through the treetops, falling on Zhu Tianlei's body. The temperature was about thirty-one or two degrees Celsius, but Zhu Tianlei did not feel the slightest heat; he felt extremely cool all over.</p><p>Whistling along the way, Zhu Tianlei walked downhill with an exceptionally good mood.</p><p>It was a wild rabbit.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei chuckled to himself; it had been quite some time since he last ate meat, so why not catch a rabbit and have some meat at home, also to supplement his parents' bodies.</p><p>Thinking of this, Zhu Tianlei moved and chased after the direction in which the rabbit was running.</p><p>The wild rabbit was very fast; an ordinary person would definitely not be able to catch up. But today's Zhu Tianlei was no ordinary person; with a few leaps and bounds, Zhu Tianlei saw the rabbit dive into a grass nest behind some rocks.</p><p>"Hehe!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stretched out his hand and suddenly thrust it into the grass nest. His palm felt a furry lump, and Zhu Tianlei opened his mouth and easily pulled the rabbit out.</p><p>It was really fat; after skinning it, it would probably weigh two or three pounds.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei carried the rabbit with a satisfied heart, preparing to leave, when he suddenly discovered that not far from the grass nest grew a cluster of purple grass.</p><p>"Zijuan Cao?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't believe his eyes as he walked over and squatted down to observe it carefully. The plant was about eighteen centimeters tall, with leaves as dense as gears, entirely purple—it really was Zijuan Cao.</p><p>This discovery made Zhu Tianlei so excited he could hardly contain himself. He carefully dug up the Zijuan Cao and took off his vest to wrap the plant carefully.</p><p>Having found such a treasure along with a rabbit, Zhu Tianlei felt like he was the happiest person in the world.</p><p>When he got home, it was almost three o'clock, and smoke was already rising from the chimney. Despite the stifling afternoon heat, Zhu Tianlei thought that no April day could be more pleasant than this one.</p><p>Seeing her son carrying a rabbit back, Hou Suqin was very happy and skillfully slaughtered and bled the rabbit. More than an hour later, a pot of fragrant braised potato rabbit meat was placed on the table.</p><p>The family enjoyed their meal in great joy.</p><p>After dinner, Zhu Tianlei gave his father Zhu Quezi another injection. This time, both father and son were relaxed. After the injection, Zhu Quezi was overjoyed and insisted on walking around. Unable to bear his father's disappointment, Zhu Tianlei helped him take a few steps inside the house.</p><p>Although it was just a few steps, when Zhu Quezi raised his head, tears streamed down his face.</p><p>In life, one only realizes how precious ordinary things are after losing them.</p><p>Night soon fell.</p><p>After confirming that his parents were asleep, Zhu Tianlei put on his clothes and quietly left through the back door. Under the stars, he headed to a low cliff behind the mountain.</p><p>It was very secluded there. He could do whatever he wanted without being noticed.</p><p>Since cultivating true qi in the gourd cave during the day, Zhu Tianlei's mood had been high. Previously, he could be considered an atheist, but everything that happened in the gourd cave completely overturned his understanding.</p><p>The feeling of nurturing and filling true qi in the dantian was truly delightful, so he decided to use this time to continue cultivating.</p><p>He sat cross-legged on a large rock at the foot of a cliff, holding his breath and silently reciting the cultivation mantra from the Immortal Spirit Medicine Technique. At the same time, he wanted to make the true qi within his body more abundant. However, this time, the ball of qi in his dantian seemed to be asleep; no matter how Zhu Tianlei focused, the true qi remained stable without any changes.</p><p>“Could it be that cultivation can only be done inside the gourd cave?”</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was puzzled by this thought.</p><p>Although his cultivation did not go smoothly, feeling the gentle night breeze and inhaling the sweet scent of corn stalks in the air, Zhu Tianlei's mood was not bad. He slowly made his way home.</p><p>The rest of the night passed without incident.</p><p>The next morning, a person who had never stepped through the gates of the Zhu family compound suddenly appeared before Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Leizi, it’s bad! Go check on it right away!"</p><p>The person standing in front of Zhu Tianlei was named Sun Bilian. She was flushed and out of breath from running so quickly.</p><p>Sun Bilian was the most arrogant woman in Hama Village; she rarely interacted with others and seemed to always look down on them.</p><p>This was because her sister's husband was the director of the Education Bureau in Yunhai City.</p><p>"Auntie, what’s happened?"</p><p>Hou Suqin jumped in surprise, as if village matters had suddenly become more frequent over the past two days.</p><p>"Leizi, go quickly! If you’re too late, someone might die!"</p><p>Sun Bilian completely ignored Hou Suqin and kept urging Zhu Tianlei to leave.</p><p>Zhu Qiezi now felt confident and even a bit proud. Just two days ago, people from families like Tan Daque and Sun Bilian would never have stepped through his gate.</p><p>"Leizi, go with Auntie Bilian right away! Saving lives is the priority!"</p><p>Zhu Quezi originally had a good heart and high awareness, and he immediately grasped the key to the problem.</p><p>"Alright, then Aunt Bilián, lead the way!"</p><p>Sun Bilian did not hesitate and rushed out of the door at almost the speed of a hundred-meter sprint. Honestly, if it weren't for the mysterious inheritance that greatly boosted his physical strength, Zhu Tianlei might not have been able to keep up with Sun Bilian's speed.</p><p>"Hurry, by the time I arrived, people were foaming at the mouth!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei knew the situation was serious and did not ask any further questions, instead following closely behind Sun Bilian as they moved forward.</p><p>It turned out to be a primary school!</p><p>The scene from yesterday flashed before Zhu Tianlei's eyes. He calmed his thoughts, reminding himself that he had come to save people, and set aside all other considerations.</p><p>The village primary school consisted of only about ten rooms. Sun Bilian led Zhu Tianlei directly into the teacher's office. Ten years ago, Zhu Tianlei frequently visited this place, but now it was vastly different from what it used to be.</p><p>There were already quite a few people standing in the office. Zhu Tianlei immediately spotted Ma Lanlan standing by the side. Their eyes met briefly, and Ma Lanlan quickly lowered her head.</p><p>"Lei'er, hurry up and take a look! If anything happens to her, Hama Gou is doomed!"</p><p>Sun Bilian forcibly dragged Zhu Tianlei over. As he lowered his head, Zhu Tianlei saw the person lying on the ground.</p><p>It was her!</p>

						<p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was imagining finding purple heartleaf later, a woman's scream suddenly echoed from ahead.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't think much about it and sprinted in the direction of the sound. After his recent practice, his speed had reached an unprecedented level, almost akin to moving without leaving a trace.</p><p>A few seconds later, Zhu Tianlei arrived at the bottom of the slope.</p><p>A woman was sitting on the ground with her hair disheveled, wearing a light red halter top and looking terrified.</p><p>It was Chen Guafu!</p><p>This was the first time Zhu Tianlei had seen Chen Guafu since that incident.</p><p>Not far from where Chen Guafu sat, a long snake with golden scales and black stripes stood upright, repeatedly spitting venom at her.</p><p>Women being afraid of snakes is perfectly normal!</p><p>Moreover, this type of snake, known as a widow snake, was highly toxic. A bite could be fatal in an instant.</p><p>"Sit there and don't move!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei knew the danger of such a snake and dared not act rashly, fearing that any sudden movement might provoke the venomous snake.</p><p>Chen Guafu lifted her head. Upon seeing Zhu Tianlei standing before her, for some reason, her originally chaotic and terrified heart suddenly calmed down.</p><p>"Oh oh, I won't move!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was somewhat surprised by Chen Guafu's cooperation but also very relieved.</p><p>Facing a venomous snake, facing a deadly danger, the words "sit there and don't move" are easy to say but hard to do.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei slowly moved his feet, trying not to make any noise on the grass beneath him.</p><p>He had to strike accurately or he might not get another chance.</p><p>Chen Widow stared intently at Zhu Tianlei, her chest rising and falling rapidly. Despite being in a life-or-death situation, Chen Widow could not control her attraction to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Run!"</p><p>Suddenly, Zhu Tianlei leaped up like lightning, grabbing the snake's head in his hand.</p><p>The snake did not expect to be caught and, in fear and anger, writhed violently, baring its fangs and trying to counterattack continuously.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei wanted to crush the snake, but the snake was restless; if he let go slightly, he would surely be bitten.</p><p>Although he possessed the skills of a spirit physician, these skills were not an invincibility talisman, so he dared not act rashly.</p><p>"Auntie, move back!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei thought for a moment. In this situation, the best solution was to throw the snake away. The area was filled with tall grass, and surely the beast would flee once it hit the ground!</p><p>Chen Widow nodded and obediently moved back several steps.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took a deep breath, then released his hand, throwing the snake away.</p><p>"Hisss!"</p><p>"Tianlei!"</p><p>To Zhu Tianlei's great surprise, as the snake was thrown away, it turned around and bit him on the wrist.</p><p>Chen Widow's face paled. She did not care about the writhing snake on the ground and rushed over, without a word putting Zhu Tianlei's bitten wrist into her mouth.</p><p>"Sister, you......"</p><p>Chen Widow seemed not to hear Zhu Tianlei's words. Her mind was filled with one thought: Zhu Tianlei could not die, must not die!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Chen Widow. She bowed her head; her snow-white neck was slightly red from the scorching sun, resembling ripe crabapples in autumn.</p><p>Chen Widow took deep breaths for seven or eight minutes until her lips numbed and the blood she spat out turned a vivid crimson before stopping.</p><p>"Tianlei, how are you?"</p><p>Looking at Chen Widow's pretty face with bloody lips adhered to her own blood, snow-white skin, and fresh red blood, their contrast was strangely captivating and mesmerizing.</p><p>"With Sister risking her life to save me, how could anything happen to me?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei curled his lips into a light smile.</p><p>It was unclear whether it was due to Chen Widow sucking the blood in time or the miraculous medical skills, Zhu Tianlei felt no discomfort in his body at all.</p><p>"Tianlei, stop joking with Sister. Sister nearly killed you, but you don't hold any grudges and even risked your life to save me just now. I only sucked out some of your wound's blood, why do you call it saving my life?"</p><p>Chen Widow felt somewhat ashamed.</p><p>At that moment, she had not thought much about it, but now, reflecting on her actions, she felt ashamed and awkward again.</p><p>How could Zhu Tianlei be unaware of Chen Widow's thoughts?</p><p>"Sister, let's forget the past. What's done is done. You saved me just now, so we even out. Don't mention owing me anymore in the future."</p><p>After that incident, Zhu Tianlei had also thought about it. Chen Widow, a young widow, did not have an easy life in the village and wanted Hu Danniú to find her a way out through him; that was understandable. The only mistake she made was acting hastily.</p><p>Moreover, Zhu Tianlei's gaze involuntarily drifted to Chen Widow's chest. Since returning from that day, he often dreamed of her, and many times, the scenes in his dreams felt like they were happening for real.</p><p>"Cough, cough..."</p><p>Suddenly, Chen Guafu cleared her throat twice. Only then did Zhu Tianlei retract his gaze, though there was not a hint of embarrassment on his face.</p><p>After all, he had already seen and touched everything before. What was there to be embarrassed about!</p><p>"Auntie, why are you alone in the mountains?"</p><p>For some reason, as soon as Zhu Tianlei asked this question, Chen Guafu's expression became awkward and embarrassed.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt a heavy weight in his heart; could it be that she had come up the mountain to do... that?</p><p>The thought made his heart instantly feel sick.</p><p>"Tianlei, don't misunderstand. I.....I......"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei's darkening face, Chen Guafu's heart immediately panicked. For some reason, she suddenly guessed what Zhu Tianlei was thinking about. If it were before, she wouldn't have cared, but now, she didn't want Zhu Tianlei to misunderstand.</p><p>"Auntie, I haven't misunderstood; whatever you want to do is your freedom, and I can't interfere."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words carried a sour undertone.</p><p>Humph, if he knew which man it was, he would make sure that person's descendants never had children!</p><p>"Tianlei, I came up the mountain to gather medicinal herbs."</p><p>Chen Guafu's eyes turned red with anxiety. Originally, she didn't want to say this, but now, if she didn't explain, Zhu Tianlei would misunderstand, and she didn't want him to speculate.</p><p>"Gather medicinal herbs?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei raised an eyebrow. Why had Chen Guafu suddenly come up the mountain to gather medicinal herbs?</p><p>"I heard Auntie Hou telling someone that you've been going to the forest every day lately to look for herbs, but not finding many. I... I don't have any other skills, so I thought about coming up the mountain to try my luck. Who knows, maybe I'll find some herbs!"</p><p>Madam Chen finished speaking, her face turning so red it seemed like blood would drip from it. She couldn't even bring herself to look at Zhu Tianlei directly.</p><p>She felt guilty towards Zhu Tianlei; she just wanted to do something to make up for her mistakes and shortcomings.</p><p>"Tianlei, you..."</p><p>Suddenly, Madam Chen's body was forcefully embraced by someone.</p>

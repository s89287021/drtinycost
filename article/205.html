						<p>She couldn't wipe her tears and rushed to the cliff side like the wind.</p><p>What met her gaze was precisely Zhu Tianlei's smirking face.</p><p>Their eyes met, and Mao Yu burst into tears.</p><p>She did not believe in gods or Buddha, nor in anything that defied natural science. But at this moment, she thanked all the gods and spirits for bestowing good fortune on Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>In Zhu Tianlei's arms was precisely Zhang Yuntao who had just committed suicide by jumping off the cliff.</p><p>"Jianxiong, you little bastard, lend me a hand!"</p><p>Hearing the voice from below Deadhead Cliff, Yao Jianxiong went dumbfounded!</p><p>Was the chairman's ghost here?</p><p>But wasn't that too quick? It should have been at midnight or during the seventh day of mourning at least!</p><p>"Tianlei, Tianlei is still alive, Jianxiong, hurry up! It's Tianlei, he didn't die."</p><p>The first to react was Ma Lanlan.</p><p>Although Yao Jianxiong's mind hadn't caught up, his actions were swift. He crawled beside Mao Yu and saw Zhu Tianlei holding Zhang Yuntao.</p><p>Yao Jianxiong felt as if a myriad of rays of light suddenly appeared before his eyes, more splendid than anything he had seen in the past twenty years.</p><p>"Jianxiong, first help me pull Yuntao up!"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao was dazed and still felt she was dreaming until Yao Jianxiong pulled her up.</p><p>"Chairman, I'll pull you up!"</p><p>After pulling Zhang Yuntao up, Yao Jianxiong immediately bent down to prepare to lift Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"You go back to the car and find a rope."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not respond to Yao Gang's suggestion but instead gave an order.</p><p>His hand rested on a protruding eagle-beak rock beside him, while his feet were positioned on a small pine tree growing out of the mountain.</p><p>Following Zhu Tianlei's instructions was already a habit for Yao Jianxiong, so he ran back to the van without hesitation and found a rope used for securing cargo.</p><p>As soon as Zhu Tianlei took the rope, he flipped over and disappeared from sight.</p><p>Overwhelmed by tension, this scene made Yao Jianxiong feel his heart pounding again.</p><p>In an instant, Zhu Tianlei's figure abruptly leaped out from beneath the cliff.</p><p>"Tianlei!"</p><p>Yang Wenjie could not control his excitement and called out Zhu Tianlei's name loudly.</p><p>"Mayor Yang, you have been put through so much fear because of me again!"</p><p>Due to the Deng Luolin virus incident, the relationship between Zhu Tianlei and Yang Wenjie had become even closer. In particular, Yang Wenjie's uprightness deeply impressed Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Seeing Yang Wenjie appear at this moment made Zhu Tianlei feel like a child caught doing something wrong by their teacher, but deep down, he was extremely moved.</p><p>"Mayor Yang, please wait a moment, I still have something to do!"</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei turned towards the Dead End Cliff. Only then did everyone notice that Zhu Tianlei had been holding onto a rope all along.</p><p>"Jianxiong, you need to lend a hand too!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pulled on the rope and found it rather difficult. He turned to Yao Jianxiong beside him and shouted. Then, Teng Kai noticed the situation and came forward voluntarily.</p><p>Surely enough, as a driver for a superior, his ability to read people's emotions and his level of awareness were unmatched by most.</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but evaluate Teng Kai in his mind.</p><p>The three men pulling on the rope were all young and strong, yet they appeared strained at that very moment. Yao Jianxiong wanted to ask what exactly was beneath the rope, but seeing Zhu Tianlei's stern expression, he held back his words.</p><p>After about four minutes, Yao Jianxiong's curiosity was satisfied.</p><p>The object on the rope was no other than Yang Zhongmin, who had fallen down with Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>However, at this moment, Yang Zhongmin's eyes were tightly shut, and his clothes were torn in several places, revealing his fatty belly that rose and fell with each breath.</p><p>Deng Chang heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing Yang Zhongmin.</p><p>"Mayor Yang, this matter is quite complicated. I understand your good intentions, but whether we are at the county government office or here, my stance remains the same: Yang Zhongmin must return with me to apologize to Xiaogang's mother on his knees."</p><p>Yang Wenjie was about to speak when Zhu Tianlei cut him off.</p><p>Deng Chang gaped in surprise once more.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's audacity truly went beyond ordinary people's imagination. Deng Chang finally felt somewhat at ease about being ridiculed and losing face.</p><p>"Then let's go back to Tianlei Pharmaceuticals first!"</p><p>Facing Zhu Tianlei's determination, Yang Wenjie showed no sign of anger; instead, he decided to follow Zhu Tianlei back to the pharmaceutical plant.</p><p>At this point, Deng Chang was convinced that Yang Wenjie's fondness for Zhu Tianlei was not a rumor. Zhu Tianlei himself had been added to his list of people best avoided.</p><p>"Mr. Chairman, those people all ran away, Chen Fanglin also left!"</p><p>Looking at the empty van, Yao Jianxiong felt a moment of embarrassment.</p><p>He felt that he had failed Zhu Tianlei's trust, and even the people couldn't be watched over.</p><p>"It's fine; they will pay for what they owe sooner or later. You don't need to worry about it anymore. Just lift him into the van!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was not bothered by this, as Yang Zhongmin would ensure those people could not escape.</p><p>In the van, the three women stared at Zhu Tianlei simultaneously without speaking a word.</p><p>Although he was surrounded by adoring admirers, this strange feeling made Zhu Tianlei feel... somewhat uneasy.</p><p>"That... I know you must all be very sad. I..."</p><p>Before Zhu Tianlei could continue, Ma Lanlan covered his mouth.</p><p>"If something really happened to you, we would go with you to die!"</p><p>The other two women nodded in agreement.</p><p>Regarding this point, Zhang Yuntao had already proven it through her actions.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face turned serious as he looked at the three women and nodded solemnly.</p><p>Yao Jianxiong, sitting in the driver's seat, stared ahead. It seemed that he did not notice anything happening in the vehicle, yet a smile appeared on his lips.</p><p>The feeling of surviving such an ordeal was truly delightful.</p><p>"Yun Tao, tell me, what happened?"</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei knew from the beginning that Zhang Yun Tao was innocent of this matter, he did not know the specific details.</p><p>Now that Yang Wenjie had become involved, he had to provide a reasonable explanation to Yang Wenjie and Deng Chang and others.</p><p>"I......"</p><p>Zhang Yun Tao glanced at Zhu Tianlei. The previous scene flashed through her mind again. For a moment, she felt nervous and afraid, but soon this fear was dispelled by the warmth and trust in Zhu Tianlei's eyes.</p><p>It turned out that Zhang Yun Tao took Xiao Gang Beng to eat candy backstage, and Xiao Gang Beng said that it was too noisy in the auditorium and wanted to go for a walk. He insisted that Zhang Yun Tao take him outside. Of course, Zhang Yun Tao could not resist Xiao Gang Beng's sweetly annoying approach, and the two of them went to the small hill behind Tianlei Pharmaceutical.</p>

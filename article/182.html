						<p>The judge nodded and turned to whisper a few words with the jurors beside him before turning back.</p><p>"The plaintiff's lawyer's objection is overruled. Please continue your defense, defendant."</p><p>Le Pan was quite surprised.</p><p>This completely did not align with normal courtroom logic. Even if this matter were just Tang Wen making idle talk, even with evidence, it shouldn't be directly related to the case. Could there be something unknown that he was unaware of?</p><p>In the audience section, Hao Xinmei and Mao Yu both expressed surprise at the same time.</p><p>What kind of act was Tang Wen putting on?</p><p>"Good, I'm sure everyone here is very curious about how Zhu Tianlei managed to kill the patient. In fact, I am also advocating for the victim's rights. After all, Zhu Tianlei has a reputation, and the victim is powerless and finds it difficult to seek justice, so they came to me. Judge, may I allow the victim's father to testify in court?"</p><p>"Request granted."</p><p>As soon as the judge finished speaking, a small door on the side of the courtroom opened, and a man in his forties wearing a double-breasted jacket slowly walked out.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked over and noticed that this man's appearance was almost identical to the deceased Wu Xiaohui.</p><p>"Elder Brother Wu, now that the judge has agreed to my request, you can say what you need to say. Don't worry; the judge will definitely take your side!"</p><p>Tang Wen spoke gently, which was surprisingly consistent with his usual manner.</p><p>Wei Baoguo in the corner snorted derisively.</p><p>"Pretense!"</p><p>The man stood next to Tang Wen, his gaze involuntarily glancing at Zhu Tianlei in the plaintiff's seat.</p><p>"My daughter is named Wu Xiaohui. She was hospitalized due to a Deng Lolu virus infection. Who knew... my daughter was only 20 years old, and I heard she was assaulted, with injuries all over her body..."</p><p>The man said as he shed tears.</p><p>"By the way, these people in the isolation zone saw it all with their own eyes!"</p><p>The man thought for a moment and added.</p><p>"Is there any witness?"</p><p>"Yes, yes, they are waiting outside!"</p><p>The man rubbed his hands, not knowing whether he was nervous or excited, and his shoulders moved slightly.</p><p>"Please call the witnesses to testify."</p><p>As the judge spoke, several people walked in from the side door. The man recognized all of them.</p><p>"Are you all witnesses?"</p><p>"Yes..."</p><p>Everyone's voices were clear but not loud.</p><p>"Did you see Mr. Zhu Tianlei attack Wu Xiaohui with your own eyes and cause her death?"</p><p>When Lei Pan heard the judge's question, he was shocked again. It was obvious that the judge was siding with Tang Wen. These two unrelated cases had been dismissed by him, and an entirely irrelevant case had been brought to trial, which completely violated the principles of a court hearing.</p><p>"Judge, I object. The case regarding Wu Xiaohui's death is unrelated to this case and should be tried separately."</p><p>This time, the judge did not even think about it before rejecting Lei Pan's request.</p><p>"That night, I heard Wu Xiaohui screaming that Dr. Zhu had assaulted her. When we rushed out, we saw that Wu Xiaohui was naked and had purple bruises all over her body, and Mr. Zhu Tianlei was standing by..."</p><p>Several people spoke up one after another, saying almost the same thing. Tang Wen glanced at Zhu Tianlei, whose eyes carried a complex emotion that was hard to decipher.</p><p>"By the way, this is the video."</p><p>One of the men pulled out a phone from his pocket.</p><p>The video on the phone showed Zhu Tianlei and Wu Xiaohui struggling with each other, though there was no sound.</p><p>"My phone’s speaker is broken,” the man explained.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei watched everything coldly, saying nothing from start to finish.</p><p>At this moment, gasps of surprise filled the courtroom.</p><p>Hao Xinmei and Mao Yu were shocked by this sudden turn of events; what on earth was happening?</p><p>"Plaintiff, do you have anything to defend yourself?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned his head to look at the person who had just testified for Tang Wen. The corners of his mouth slowly curled up into an extremely handsome arc.</p><p>This smile made these people’s hearts involuntarily tremble.</p><p>This man had accompanied them through some of the hardest times in their lives during the isolation period, and each time he examined them, he wore this kind of smile on his face.</p><p>However, they never imagined that when they saw this smile again, it would be in a courtroom.</p><p>"Cao Dong, I remember you were admitted to the isolation ward with a high fever of 41 degrees Celsius and couldn’t even speak. I and Nurse Leader Zhao stayed by your side all night, constantly taking your temperature, administering saline solution, and giving you antipyretics. Later, when you woke up, you had developed an illness in your left arm due to the high fever, and I made time every day to treat you. Now, is your left arm fully recovered?"</p><p>The man named Cao Dong, who was called out, blushed and lowered his head.</p><p>"Liuyan, you are the weakest in the isolation zone and also suffer from congenital osteogenesis imperfecta. The difficulty of taking care of you is much greater than that of an ordinary person. However, none of the medical staff have found this troublesome; I persistently gave you acupuncture and medication every day. By the time you left the isolation zone, you could walk like a normal person..."</p><p>...</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at each person in turn, stating their names one by one and recounting everything that had happened to them in the isolation zone. Each time he mentioned someone's name, that person would lower their head.</p><p>"Vice President Tang, I am very grateful for your support and assistance to the isolation zone. One could say that the normal operation of the isolation zone and the rapid recovery of its patients owe much to you. Thank you!"</p><p>Finally, Zhu Tianlei shifted his tone and sincerely thanked Tang Wen.</p><p>However, Tang Wen suddenly felt a chill run down his back.</p><p>"Since Vice President Tang stated that the drug for treating Dengluolin virus was developed by you, may I ask when lung edema occurred in patients infected with Dengluolin virus, and when internal organ congestion began?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei asked casually, but this made Tang Wen's face turn pale immediately.</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei had reported to him on the progress of treatment in the isolation zone, the details provided were limited. How could he know about these clinical specifics?</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, don't confuse the issue. The investigation at hand is regarding your alleged involvement in the death of patient Wu Xiaohui. Moreover, the questions you are asking involve medical secrets; how can they be disclosed casually?"</p><p>Tang Wen concealed his nervousness and tried to sound calm.</p><p>"I will tell you that Wu Xiaohui's cause of death was acute lung edema triggered by emotional agitation and excessive exercise, which also led to internal organ congestion. The red spots on her body were caused by subcutaneous tissue congestion due to organ congestion."</p><p>Tang Wen had not been involved in the treatment and thus knew nothing about it. However, after glancing at the witnesses in court as well as Wu Xiaohui's father, Wu Xiaozhong, his emotions gradually stabilized.</p><p>"Yes, it was indeed emotional agitation and excessive exercise that led to Wu Xiaohui's death. Didn't Doctor Zhu see the video just now? A female patient was pulling on Doctor Zhu outside a ward door in her underwear at three in the morning; the reason for this is not hard to understand."</p>

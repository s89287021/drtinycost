						<p>Seeing Zhao Zhiguo collapse, Li Ping froze. He still had a lot of anger pent up inside him, yet here he was, blissfully unconscious.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei twitched the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Collapse?</p><p>Where in this world would such good fortune come from?</p><p>Holding an acupuncture needle, Zhu Tianlei squatted beside Zhao Zhiguo. The needle pointed straight down and pierced through Zhao Zhiguo's Guanyuan point with a puff. Before anyone could react, it was pulled out and swiftly inserted into various points on Zhao Zhiguo's body like lightning. However, if there were any skilled traditional Chinese medicine practitioners present, they would have noticed that Zhu Tianlei always deviated about 0.5 centimeters from the correct acupuncture points.</p><p>The sensation of the needle entering an acupuncture point is entirely different from it entering flesh and blood.</p><p>As soon as the seventh needle was inserted, Zhao Zhiguo let out a muffled cry and opened his eyes.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at him with a radiant smile.</p><p>"Doctor Zhao, the ground is cold; it harms your kidneys!"</p><p>Fuming with anger, Zhao Zhiguo spat out blood but could not speak a word.</p><p>"Doctor Zhao, you are suspected of obstructing fair law enforcement and interfering with medical investigations. Please come with us for an investigation!"</p><p>Yang Jing straightened her expression.</p><p>She was a righteous person, much like Yang Hua, so she naturally had no reason to overlook Zhao Zhiguo's wrongdoing.</p><p>"Celestial Official Shi, take Doctor Zhao away!"</p><p>The young man who had been standing silently beside Yang Jing moved towards Zhao Zhiguo upon hearing this. Zhao Zhiguo trembled all over.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, I won't let you off!"</p><p>"I am always at your service!"</p><p>Watching Zhao Zhiguo being taken away, Li Ping grabbed Zhu Tianlei's hand.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, I'm sorry. It was my mistake earlier; I didn't ask carefully or investigate properly and misunderstood you!"</p><p>Li Ping wasn't lying. Although Zhao Zhiguo was taken for investigation, the patient survived, thus ensuring Li Ping's position as director. Therefore, the credit went to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Director Li, it is part of your duty. I understand!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt pleased that Zhao Zhiguo was humiliated.</p><p>"Tianlei, you're amazing! How did you know Zhao Zhiguo would target you?"</p><p>Ge Yang had already ordered everyone else to leave, and Geng Wenyu had gone downstairs with his people. In the ICU ward, only Yang Hua, Li Ping, Zhu Tianlei, and Ge Yang and his grandson remained. Yang Hua asked with some praise.</p><p>"Director Yang, you flatter me! How could I have known Zhao Zhiguo would target me? I just didn't want you to go out of your way for an unnecessary trip. It turned out to be a lucky guess."</p><p>On the way there, Yang Hua had called Zhu Tianlei to say he was bringing an offer letter. Zhu Tianlei figured that the city hospital was on the outskirts of Dahexian County and not far from the county hospital, so Yang Hua came directly with the offer letter.</p><p>When Li Ping entered, Zhu Tianlei vaguely sensed something was amiss and sent a message to Yang Hua to meet him in the ICU ward of the Intensive Care Building.</p><p>"Haha, I see!"</p><p>After hearing Zhu Tianlei's explanation, Yang Hua laughed heartily. It only proved that Zhao Zhiguo had done many wrong things and that heaven did not support him.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, I have one more question: How did you know it was Zhao Zhiguo who unplugged the instrument's power?"</p><p>This puzzled Li Ping immensely. From beginning to end, Zhu Tianlei hadn't left the ward a step out of place; he couldn't possibly have X-ray vision! Furthermore, to verify if Zhao Zhiguo had unplugged the power, Li Ping reviewed the surveillance footage from the power room and confirmed it was indeed Zhao Zhiguo.</p><p>"This is also a guess. The power supply and instruments in intensive care are key areas under protection and maintenance and each has its own backup power source. There's no possibility of them shutting down without cause. Therefore, for all these instruments to shut down simultaneously, it could only be due to human intervention."</p><p>Now, the text will move to the senior copy editor phase for deep editing.</p><p>"I am always at your service!"</p><p>Watching Zhao Zhiguo being taken away, Li Ping grabbed Zhu Tianlei's hand.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, I'm sorry. It was my mistake earlier—I didn't ask carefully or investigate properly and misunderstood you!"</p><p>Li Ping wasn’t lying.

It was my fault earlier; I didn't ask thoroughly or investigate properly and ended up misunderstanding you!"</p><p>Li Ping wasn't lying. Although Zhao Zhiguo had been taken for investigation, the patient survived, ensuring Li Ping's position as director. Therefore, the credit belonged to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Director Li, that’s part of my duty. I understand."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt a sense of satisfaction knowing Zhao Zhiguo had been humiliated.</p><p>"Tianlei, you're amazing!

Therefore, for all these instruments to shut down simultaneously, it could only be due to human intervention."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the completely blacked-out monitoring instruments and continued to say,</p><p>"The other party's intention is clearly to take Old Master Ge's life. But if they are enemies, Old Master Ge is already at his last gasp; what would be the point of doing something like this? If they are not enemies, then they want Old Master Ge to die by my hand. Just close your eyes and think about it, you can guess who this person is right away."</p><p>Li Ping opened his mouth wide in amazement, immensely relieved that he had realized in time and did not become an enemy of this person; otherwise, he would have no idea how he died.</p><p>"Big Brother Zhu, Grandpa has something to say to you!"</p><p>Ge Yang's voice came over, and Zhu Tianlei turned around to see Old Master Ge lying down again.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, go ahead. I'll take Principal Yang out for a walk to exchange some thoughts!"</p><p>Li Ping was very good at reading the room, and Yang Hua was no fool either. They chatted for a moment before leaving the ward and casually closed the door behind them.</p><p>"Say it, what do you want?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at Old Master Ge Tianhang, whose face still looked somewhat pale, a hint of coldness flickering in his eyes.</p><p>"Old Master Ge, your words seem rather overconfident. The things I, Zhu Tianlei, desire, you may not be able to afford!"</p><p>Ge Tianhang's expression darkened.</p><p>He had started struggling at the age of ten and established the Black Eagle Society in his twenties; no one dared to call him overconfident.</p><p>"Are you looking down on me, Ge something?"</p><p>"Grandpa......"</p><p>Ge Yang felt somewhat embarrassed. Zhu Big Brother had saved their grandfather and grandson's lives, but Grandpa did not thank him instead was being so confrontational. If Zhu Big Brother really wanted to repay the favor, he wouldn't have waited this long.</p><p>Grandpa truly has a small mind!</p><p>Ge Tianying glared at his grandson, who had always been soft-spoken and trusting of everyone. That was why he didn't dare to die.</p><p>"It seems that Old Master Ge is safe. I'll take my leave now!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said this before stepping towards the door.</p><p>Ge Tianying was taken aback, not expecting the other party's temper to be so short; after all, he had only spoken two sentences!</p><p>"Stop right there!"</p><p>Feeling his pride wounded and with his grandson giving him a resentful look, Ge Tianying blurted out,</p><p>"Old Master Ge, I saved you purely out of respect for Ge Yang. If you want to repay me, then repay my grandson!"</p><p>With that, Zhu Tianlei pulled the door open, turned without looking back, and left.</p><p>The nurse had witnessed everything that happened in the ward earlier and idolized Zhu Tianlei. Now, seeing her hero before her, she was ecstatic.</p><p>"That..."</p><p>However, by the time the nurse gathered her courage to speak shyly, Zhu Tianlei had already taken off his sterile suit and entered the elevator.</p><p>Inside the elevator, the thought of Ge Tianying's expression made Zhu Tianlei feel a bit uncomfortable. </p><p>Grandfather and grandson, though sharing the same bloodline, were two very different people.</p><p>Exiting the elevator, Zhu Tianlei walked straight out to the door. Although the hospital building was large, it was well-designed, allowing even a first-time visitor like Zhu Tianlei to easily find the exit.</p><p>As soon as he stepped outside, he saw his previously driven jeep parked by the roadside.</p>

						<p>At this moment, Yang Xiaoxue was convulsing all over, her eyes tightly shut, lips tinged with blue, and foam indeed covered the corners of her mouth as Sun Bilian had said.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not hesitate; he quickly crouched down, using his fingers to lift Yang Xiaoxue's eyelids. He found that her pupils were slightly dilated. Upon closer inspection, small patches of purple spots were scattered on the exposed parts of her arms.</p><p>"Food poisoning!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei made a quick diagnosis. Ma Lanlan looked at Zhu Tianlei's profile, feeling utterly surprised. She had always thought that Zhu Tianlei could save Hu Daxiu and Tan Jiaifuren only because he was lucky and got it right by chance.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue's current symptoms were extremely similar to an epileptic seizure. However, Zhu Tianlei made this determination with just one glance, which could definitely not be attributed to luck alone.</p><p>"Yes, I asked earlier; Teacher Yang ate vegetables for breakfast that she had picked from Black Tiger Forest herself last night. It was... apricot mushrooms!"</p><p>Upon hearing the words "apricot mushrooms," everyone present turned pale.</p><p>Hadamagou has three treasures: toad venom, toad skin, and purple heart grass. Besides these treasures, there are two poisons equally famous— besides the rice ringed snake, apricot mushrooms were the other one.</p><p>All native Hadamagou villagers knew this fact, so they stayed away from these two toxic substances. Even in years of famine, no one dared to touch apricot mushrooms.</p><p>"Damn it! If anything happens to Xiaoxue, I won't live either!"</p><p>Sun Bilian suddenly sat on the ground and burst into tears.</p><p>Ma Lanlan's heart was also not at ease. Yang Xiaoxue was only twenty-one years old; reportedly, she had just graduated from university and came to Hadamagou to teach. Who would have thought that she encountered this situation just two days after arriving in Hadamagou.</p><p>Throughout history, no one who mistook apricot mushrooms for food has ever survived poisoning!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned, looking at Yang Xiaoxue lying on the ground with only a faint breath. He recalled how the girl had stood gracefully in the morning light earlier that day, as beautiful as a fairy.</p><p>"I can save her!"</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, Teacher Yang has been poisoned by apricot mushrooms, there is absolutely no way to cure it!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan's feelings towards Zhu Tianlei had long since undergone a subtle transformation, so her reminder was entirely well-intentioned and came from the heart.</p><p>"Don’t worry, I have confidence in myself!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei placed one hand on Yang Xiaoxue’s wrist, took a deep breath, and his first priority now was to expel the apricot mushroom poison from Yang Xiaoxue's body.</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei’s extremely confident demeanor, Ma Lanlan no longer said anything but her eyes betrayed her concern.</p><p>"Rascal, who are you, daring to lay hands on Xiaoxue!"</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was about to channel spiritual energy, he suddenly heard a loud shout from the doorway and saw a middle-aged man in his late forties enter with an angry expression on his face, followed by two people wearing white coats.</p><p>"Bureau Chief Yang, this......this really is......"</p><p>Yang Dong’s face was ashen, and Yao Gang, who entered behind him, also looked extremely displeased. He felt that he might end up serving as village chief indefinitely.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei immediately guessed the man's identity but remained calm and composed, neither servile nor arrogant.</p><p>"Villager? Village Chief Yao, this is how you treat my daughter, sending a mere villager to tend to her! I can see that you want nothing more than Xiaoxue’s life!"</p><p>Yang Dong was livid. Upon receiving the call, he abandoned his halfway-completed meeting and rushed to fetch two doctors from the city hospital, only to find his beloved daughter foaming at the mouth and pale on the ground, with a villager treating her. How could he not be furious, almost enraged.</p><p>"Bureau Chief Yang, Tianlei......"</p><p>"I won’t listen. If anything happens to Xiaoxue, neither you Yao Gang nor this rascal will get away scot-free!"</p><p>Two doctors in white coats quickly crouched beside Yáng Xiǎoxuě. One of them, a chubby man, deliberately elbowed Zhū Tiānlěi aside.</p><p>"Doctor Zhào, Doctor Li, how is Xiao Xue?"</p><p>Yáng Dōng asked cautiously. Throughout his career in the bureaucracy, he had experienced all kinds of tumultuous situations, but never had he felt so panicked and terrified.</p><p>"Director Yáng, your daughter has food poisoning. Due to missing the optimal rescue time, she may..."</p><p>The chubby doctor only spoke half of his sentence, but anyone could figure out the rest.</p><p>Zhū Tiānlěi glanced at this man; truly despicable. He was incompetent, unable to save someone, yet insisted on blaming others. Such a person did not deserve to wear that white coat.</p><p>"Ah! Yao Jiāng, and you good-for-nothing fellow, it’s all your fault for harming my Xiao Xue! I want you to pay with your lives!"</p><p>Yáng Dōng completely lost his composure. If he had known this would happen, he would have even risked a falling out with Xiao Xue rather than agreeing for her to teach in Toad Gully. His precious daughter was only twenty-one!</p><p>Everyone present lowered their heads, as silent as cicadas in winter. After such an incident, no words could change anything.</p><p>Seeing Yáng Dōng lunging towards him, Zhū Tiānlěi stretched out a single hand and pressed down on Yáng Dōng's shoulder. Yáng Dōng struggled, but could not escape at all.</p><p>He had come from a sports school and studied sanda. Though in his fifties, he could usually fend off two or three young men in a normal situation. But now, with only one hand pressing down on his shoulder, he was completely immobilized, shocking Yáng Dōng.</p><p>"You murderer! Not only did you kill Teacher Yang, but now you dare attack Director Yáng? You are simply disrespectful! You..."</p><p>The chubby doctor seemed to have some grudge against Zhū Tiānlěi and seized every opportunity to denigrate him.</p><p>"Murderer? If not for your obstruction and causing chaos, Teacher Yang would have already woken up. If we must call someone a murderer, it should be you!"</p><p>Zhū Tiānlěi truly hated the term "murderer."</p><p>"Really, bragging is not paying taxes. The toxins have already spread to the bloodstream and are about to reach the heart. Can you save him?"</p><p>"If I could save him, what would happen then?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had a stern look on his face, with a hint of cruelty passing through his eyes.</p><p>"If you can revive Teacher Yang, I Zhao Zhiguo will kneel down and call you my grandmaster!"</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo looked at Zhu Tianlei's handsome and tall figure, feeling extremely angry. He simply disliked Zhu Tianlei, so he wanted to trample on him. He didn't believe that Yang Xiaoxue could be saved after the toxins had affected her heart. Humph!</p><p>"I, Zhu Tianlei, don't lack disciples who are unvirtuous and incompetent. If I revive Teacher Yang, you will take off your white coat!"</p><p>Taking off the white coat naturally didn't mean changing clothes; everyone knew what it symbolized.</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo blurted out his threat without much thought.</p><p>"Very well, Zhao Zhiguo swears to heaven that if you revive Teacher Yang, I will never practice medicine again. If I break this oath, may lightning strike me down!"</p><p>"Really, bragging is not paying taxes. The toxins have already spread to the bloodstream and are about to reach the heart. Can you save him?"</p><p>"If I could save him, what would happen then?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had a stern look on his face, with a hint of cruelty passing through his eyes.</p><p>"If you can revive Teacher Yang, I Zhao Zhiguo will kneel down and call you my grandmaster!"</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo looked at Zhu Tianlei's handsome and tall figure, feeling extremely angry. He simply disliked Zhu Tianlei, so he wanted to trample on him. He didn't believe that Yang Xiaoxue could be saved after the toxins had affected her heart. Humph!</p><p>"I, Zhu Tianlei, don't lack disciples who are unvirtuous and incompetent. If I revive Teacher Yang, you will take off your white coat!"</p><p>Taking off the white coat naturally didn't mean changing clothes; everyone knew what it symbolized.</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo blurted out his threat without much thought.</p><p>"Very well, Zhao Zhiguo swears to heaven that if you revive Teacher Yang, I will never practice medicine again. If I break this oath, may lightning strike me down!"</p><p>"Truly, bragging is not paying taxes. The toxins have already spread through the bloodstream and are on the verge of reaching the heart. Can you save him?"</p><p>"If I could save him, what would happen then?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face was stern, with a hint of cruelty flashing in his eyes.</p><p>"If you can revive Teacher Yang, I, Zhao Zhiguo, will kneel before you and call you my grandmaster!"</p><p>Zhao Zhiguo stared at Zhu Tianlei's handsome and imposing figure, feeling an intense wave of anger. He despised Zhu Tianlei, and that was why he wanted to humiliate him. He didn't believe for a moment that Yang Xiaoxue could be saved after the toxins had invaded her heart. Humph!</p><p>"I, Zhu Tianlei, do not lack disciples who are unvirtuous and incompetent. If I revive Teacher Yang, you will discard your white coat!"</p><p>Discarding the white coat symbolized more than just changing clothes; everyone understood its deeper meaning.</p><p>Without a moment's hesitation, Zhao Zhiguo made his vow.</p><p>"Very well, Zhao Zhiguo swears to heaven that if you revive Teacher Yang, I will never practice medicine again. Should I break this oath, may lightning strike me down!"</p>

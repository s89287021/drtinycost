						<p>The woman's voice was as gentle as a man's. It was also very tender.</p><p>"Could it be that her due date has been advanced? Alright, Mengmeng, wait for me for a moment; I'll go ask for leave from my boss, and we'll head to the hospital right away!"</p><p>The staff member treated his wife quite well.</p><p>However, Zhu Tianlei wasn't in the mood to deal with these matters. After picking up the documents, he intended to leave. At that moment, the woman who had been standing beside the counter suddenly gasped and fell to the ground.</p><p>"Mengmeng, what's wrong?"</p><p>Seeing his wife crouch down, the staff member hurriedly ran out from behind the counter and knelt beside her.</p><p>"A-qiang, my stomach hurts, it really hurts!"</p><p>However, within an instant, the woman's face turned ashen.</p><p>"Hang on, I......I'll call 120 right now!"</p><p>The staff member was also a first-time father and had never experienced childbirth before, causing him to panic for a moment.</p><p>"A-qiang, it hurts, it really hurts, it feels like I'm going to die!"</p><p>Large beads of sweat trickled down the woman's face, quickly wetting her hair.</p><p>The staff member's hand was being held by his wife, preventing him from moving; he was so anxious that his eyes turned red.</p><p>At this point, a crowd gathered around them, including other staff members and colleagues.</p><p>"Hongqiang, I've called 120, but the emergency center said all ambulances are currently dispatched, and it might take over an hour for one to arrive!"</p><p>A man of about the same age as the staff member spoke from the crowd.</p><p>"What? More than an hour?"</p><p>Hearing his colleague's words, the officer's face turned pale.</p><p>Giving birth is like stepping into the gates of hell for women; who knows what will happen after an hour?</p><p>"Ah Qiang, it hurts so much!"</p><p>The woman's screams grew more and more piercing, echoing through the large office hall.</p><p>"Oh, the pregnant woman is bleeding. Could it be a severe hemorrhage?"</p><p>At that moment, someone in the crowd shouted in alarm. Indeed, blood was slowly seeping out from under the woman's dress and soon flowed onto the tiles.</p><p>"Xiao Meng, Xiao Meng!"</p><p>The officer, panic-stricken and at a loss for what to do, hugged his wife and repeatedly called her name.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei watched the unfolding scene before him. He hated the officer's disdainful attitude, but the woman was innocent, as was the child.</p><p>"Hold it, what are you going to do?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei heading towards the crowd, Mao Yu frowned and asked.</p><p>"I can't just stand by and watch!"</p><p>"Do you know what condition the pregnant woman is in? Do you know what could happen if you act recklessly? It's likely that both of them will die. Can you take responsibility for that?"</p><p>This was the first time since the beginning that Mao Yu spoke with an emotional tone.</p><p>"I'll act, and there will be only one result!"</p><p>"What result?"</p><p>"Mother and child are safe!"</p><p>After saying these four words, Zhu Tianlei walked over to the expectant mother with determination.</p><p>Mao Yu was taken aback; this Zhu Tianlei seemed different from what she had imagined.</p><p>"Get out of my way, I'll deliver her!"</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei's voice rang out, the clerk looked up, but instead of feeling hope when he saw him, his heart became even more irate.</p><p>"You're just a rural bumpkin with nothing to offer; how can you deliver my wife? Are you trying to kill my wife and child?"</p><p>The clerk glared at Zhu Tianlei and shouted without hesitation.</p><p>"Ah Qiang, I'm dying, it hurts so much, wuwu......"</p><p>At this moment, the expectant mother let out another piercing scream, her voice like that of a malevolent spirit, sending chills down their spines.</p><p>"I'll say it one more time, I will deliver her. If you don't move out of my way, you won't see your wife or child again!"</p><p>"What do you mean? Are you cursing me? What are you trying to achieve?"</p><p>The clerk's emotions grew increasingly agitated; he and his wife had worked hard for years to become pregnant, only to be faced with such an unexpected situation. He couldn't comprehend why.</p><p>"Move out of the way!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't want to continue talking to the clerk. He reached out and pressed on the clerk's shoulder, causing him to involuntarily twist aside. Zhu Tianlei then steadied the expectant mother, placing his fingers on her wrist.</p><p>The expectant mother's pulse was thready and weak, clearly indicating signs of severe hemorrhage.</p><p>"I can guarantee their safety!"</p><p>Feeling the officer lunging towards him again, Zhu Tianlei said in a stern voice.</p><p>The sentence was short but carried weight and power, making the officer's lunge come to an abrupt halt.</p><p>At this point, he could only trust this person!</p><p>"Sis, come help me for a moment!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked around and called out to a middle-aged woman standing among the crowd. She was also a kind-hearted person and, without any hesitation, squatted down upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's call.</p><p>"Hold her back with me, I will be giving her an injection soon, she might struggle, so pay attention and make sure her body remains stable!"</p><p>The elder sister nodded seriously.</p><p>"You come over too, hold your wife's leg. When it comes to delivery, you will be responsible for pulling the baby out; do it gently so as not to harm the child!"</p><p>The officer rushed forward and also nodded seriously.</p><p>As long as his wife and child were safe, he would agree to anything!</p><p>With preparations complete, Zhu Tianlei took out the silver needles and quickly inserted them into several key points on the pregnant woman. As expected, the upper part of her body began to convulse. The elder sister was very helpful, firmly holding down the shoulders of the laboring woman, greatly reducing Zhu Tianlei's difficulties.</p><p>The woman continued to scream, drenched in sweat, her face as pale as paper. However, after Zhu Tianlei inserted his last silver needle, the convulsions stopped.</p><p>"Mengmeng, don't scare me like that! What happened?"</p><p>Seeing his wife suddenly fall silent after screaming continuously before, the officer immediately became anxious, his gaze towards Zhu Tianlei now filled with suspicion and anger.</p><p>"What did you do to my wife? Tell me, what did you do to my wife?"</p><p>The clerk was waving his fist angrily. Zhu Tianlei was currently channeling spiritual energy to the pregnant woman and couldn't afford to be distracted by the clerk, so he took a punch squarely on the face.</p><p>"You don't have any sense of reason at all, huh? Your wife is being treated right now, and if you don't appreciate it or thank me, that's fine. But what kind of man are you to start fighting?" </p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback, not expecting Mao Yu to actually step in on his behalf—what a sight!</p><p>"Who are you? Standing here talking without considering the consequences! This is my wife; how could I not be worried? If anything happens to her, I'll make you pay for both of their lives!"</p><p>The clerk said menacingly while staring at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei continuously channeled spiritual energy into the pregnant woman's body, just like he had done for Tan Jia's wife. For a successful childbirth, she needed sufficient stamina.</p><p>"Oh my! The pregnant woman has opened her eyes—what a surprise!"</p><p>The crowd burst into applause, and hope flickered in the clerk's eyes.</p><p>"Xiao Meng, Xiao Meng, how are you?"</p><p>"A Qiang, I feel much better now......"</p><p>"That's good news, that's good news!"</p>

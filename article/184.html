						<p>Tang Wen was rather taken aback.</p><p>Is this Wang Hao a fool? Could he not understand that testifying in court like this would be pouring dirt on himself?</p><p>"Young man, you'd better think carefully before speaking. This testimony is no game; it carries legal responsibilities."</p><p>Tang Wen said with what he thought to be kindness.</p><p>"This is my chat record with Wu Xiaohui and the transfer record of the 500 yuan she asked for."</p><p>Wang Hao took out his phone, opened the chat interface between him and Wu Xiaohui, and then handed it over to Lei Pan.</p><p>Wu Xiaozhong was also rather taken aback.</p><p>He knew what his daughter was up to, but he never thought that even in the isolation zone, she would still do such things.</p><p>He glanced at Tang Wen, then at Zhu Tianlei, secretly making up his mind. Wu Xiaohui was already dead; from now on, he had to rely solely on himself.</p><p>"Oh, so you're the boy Xiao Hui's been hanging around with? I told you, how could Xiao Hui have gotten infected by Dengluolin virus out of nowhere? It must be all your doing! Now you've killed my daughter. That's not acceptable; you have to pay for my daughter’s life and compensate me!"</p><p>Wu Xiaozhong pointed at Wang Hao, his voice booming.</p><p>Tang Wen's expression turned ugly instantly. Did Wu Xiaozhong really understand what he was saying? At this point, they should be pinning everything on Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>However, Wu Xiaozhong ignored Tang Wen's constant blinking eyes.</p><p>"I'll tell you, my little Xiao Hui earns over 10,000 yuan a month and gives me at least 8,000 yuan as maintenance. Now that you've killed Xiao Hui, you have to support me. If we calculate it at 8,000 per month, I’m 45 years old now, so that’s another 35 years until I'm 80. Three times eight is twenty-four; five times eight is forty... You have to compensate me with 3.3 million yuan. If you don't give me a single cent more, you'll be heading to prison!"</p><p>Wu Xiaozhong calculated the compensation amount clearly, coming up with it in just a blink.</p><p>Wang Hao's expression did not change at all.</p><p>Tang Wen's face had already sunk to the bottom.</p><p>"According to the content on WeChat, Wu Xiaohui contacted Wang Hao proactively. The two of them were not boyfriend and girlfriend but rather in a business relationship. Wu Xiaohui was involved in that."</p><p>Lei Pan read through the chat records, handed his phone over to the judge, and said.</p><p>"You are lying. My daughter is an innocent maiden, and you, as a lawyer, dared to slander my daughter's reputation. You must compensate for it, pay for her loss of reputation, and also my consolation money—100,000."</p><p>Wu Xiaozhong was like a rabid dog, biting whoever spoke.</p><p>However, his behavior undoubtedly transformed him from the previously pitiable victim into an insatiable rogue profiting from his daughter's death.</p><p>How credible could the testimony of such a rogue be?</p><p>"The plaintiff has presented two pieces of evidence. One is a statement signed by 121 people in isolation, proving that the argument between the plaintiff and Wu Xiaohui on that night was instigated unilaterally by Wu Xiaohui. The other piece of evidence is a corpse examination report issued by Yunhai Municipal Public Security Bureau. The report indicates that Wu Xiaohui's death was caused by acute onset of Dengluolin virus leading to organ congestion and respiratory failure, unrelated to any other factors."</p><p>Having said this, the judge flipped over the two pieces of paper and unfolded them towards the courtroom.</p><p>Tang Wen immediately broke out in a cold sweat. If he hadn't been gripping the table corner tightly, he would have collapsed.</p><p>Stay calm, stay calm. Even if Zhu Tianlei could prove that he was not related to Wu Xiaohui's death, he couldn't prove that the drug was something he had developed. All his testimonial witnesses were involved in drug development and belonged to a common interest group; their statements might not be trusted. He still had a chance.</p><p>Tang Wen kept repeating this to himself.</p><p>"Certainly!"</p><p>Lei Pan almost regarded himself as an audience member watching a play. If it weren't for Zhu Tianlei's reminder, he would have been immersed in his sudden embarrassment and delight.</p><p>Although this was unbecoming of his professional image, what could be done? Wasn't life supposed to be filled with uncertainty and grandeur?</p><p>"Deputy President Tang said the medicines were developed by his own team. Then, I ask a simple question: Why are Bai Zhu and Fu Ling included in the medicine?"</p><p>"It is because people infected with Deng Luolin virus will experience mild anemia due to organ congestion, so it is necessary to add blood-supplementing herbs."</p><p>Tang Wen thought that Zhu Tianlei would ask some difficult questions; after all, he was a medical doctor. Although his specialization was clinical medicine, he was quite familiar with the basic properties of traditional Chinese medicines.</p><p>"Is Deputy President Tang certain?"</p><p>"Certainly. Does Doctor Zhu have any other opinion?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled slightly.</p><p>"Bai Zhu and Fu Ling both have blood-supplementing effects, but I added these two herbs to the medicine not for that purpose."</p><p>Tang Wen's eyes widened. Not for blood supplementation?</p><p>"Because before we developed a successful treatment drug, in order to stabilize the condition, we injected large amounts of antibiotics to patients. However, while antibiotics can suppress the illness, they also cause significant damage to the patient's stomach lining. I observed that other isolation zones in the country were also using antibiotics as their treatment method, so in order to repair the damage to the stomach lining during the treatment phase, I added Bai Zhu and Fu Ling, which have relatively mild effects."</p><p>After Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, Tang Wen knew he was in trouble.</p><p>"There are more than thirty kinds of treatment drugs. Forgetting one or two is quite normal, right? What does that prove?"</p><p>At this point, Tang Wen could only stubbornly deny.</p><p>"Yes, it is normal for Deputy President Tang to be busy with various interviews and lectures while also being concerned about the patients in the isolation zone."</p><p>Unlike Tang Wen, Zhu Tianlei not only did not refute Tang Wen's words but also gave him affirmation.</p><p>"However, while Deputy President Tang was busy accepting interviews and giving lectures, he might have forgotten something."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>This was Tang Wen's unconscious question.</p><p>"A person who has never had contact with patients, someone without any clinical experience, cannot conjure up drug research and formulation out of thin air."</p><p>A plain truth so ordinary it instantly plunged Tang Wen into despair.</p><p>"Brother Kong, as the first national case of Dengluolin virus infection, I believe you could say a few words."</p><p>Kong Shengbin had volunteered to appear in court, although Zhu Tianlei did not understand his intention. However, within the isolation area, they had built up a deep friendship, and he admired Kong Shengbin greatly, so he accepted his request.</p><p>"Your Honor, members of the jury, distinguished spectators, my name is Kong Shengbin, the first case of Dengluolin virus infection discovered in the nation. Fortunately, I survived among the 23,876 infection cases and 3,755 deaths nationwide. My survival was not due to mere luck but thanks to Doctor Zhu and the dedicated care and round-the-clock treatment provided by dozens of medical staff in the isolation area."</p>

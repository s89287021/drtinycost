						<p>Zhu Tianlei, of course, knew who Director Ke was referring to, but what puzzled him was why Li Xu had started bleeding again despite stopping the hemorrhaging both externally and internally. He had confidence in his medical skills.</p><p>"Inside, Junfeng, quickly take this young man in!"</p><p>Upon hearing Director Ke's words, Shen Junfeng immediately led Zhu Tianlei towards the emergency center lobby.</p><p>"Director, it's bad! The patient's heartbeat has stopped!"</p><p>As soon as Zhu Tianlei entered the lobby, he saw Dr. Xue Ping, whom he had encountered earlier at the scene, rushing out anxiously, her hair messy on both sides of her face.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>The loss of a heartbeat meant death to a person, and as doctors, they were more aware than anyone else what this signified.</p><p>"Where is the patient?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei coldly glanced at Xue Ping, who had come out, and asked in a low voice.</p><p>Xue Ping felt guilty and dared not meet Zhu Tianlei's gaze. She quickly turned around and led him into the emergency area alongside Shen Junfeng.</p><p>On the hospital bed, Li Xu was covered in fresh blood; one of his hands hung off the side, and he was completely motionless. Two nurses stood beside him, performing CPR on Li Xu.</p><p>"Make way!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei quickly reached the bedside in three strides, causing the two nurses to stare in astonishment at him, wondering who this person was who had dared enter the emergency area. However, upon seeing Director Ke's expression, they complied, though unsure of his identity.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sat by the bed and grabbed Li Xu's wrist, his face darkening.</p><p>Li Xu's vital signs were almost nonexistent now.</p><p>"Where are the silver needles on him?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at Li Xu's body, only to find that none of the silver needles he had inserted were visible.</p><p>"I......I.......I pulled them out!"</p><p>Xue Ping shuddered in fear upon seeing Zhu Tianlei's horrifying gaze.</p><p>"You're killing him!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei could not help but shout in anger. Everyone knew what secondary injuries meant for a critically injured patient.</p><p>"I.....I....."</p><p>Xue Ping's face turned deathly pale, but she did not know what to say. Her mind was in complete chaos; she already realized her mistake, but time could not be rewritten.</p><p>"Boy, this is Xue's fault. I've already scolded her. The urgent task now is to save the patient. What about......saving him first!"</p><p>Director Ke also knew about the incident; it was Xue Ping's fault, and it was understandable for Zhu Tianlei to be angry. However, the error had been made, and there was nothing they could do about it now.</p><p>"Humph!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei let out a cold snort but realized that it was not the time to assign blame. Thus, he ignored Xue Ping and focused on providing Li Xu with a large amount of spiritual energy to preserve his vital signs.</p><p>The entire emergency area was eerily silent, with the footsteps in the hall echoing clearly.</p><p>Everyone stared intently at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei closed his eyes and moved his hands constantly over Li Xu's body. Due to the critical injury, Li Xu's blood vessels were severely constricted, hindering the flow of spiritual energy. Zhu Tianlei could only work segment by segment, simultaneously clearing the blood vessels and channeling spiritual energy.</p><p>Soon, Zhu Tianlei's back was drenched in sweat.</p><p>Time ticked by second after second, and it was about twenty minutes later that Zhu Tianlei finally withdrew his hand, took out the needle bag from his pocket, and skillfully re-administered the injection.</p><p>"Director Ke, this time, you must ensure that the needles in his body stay for at least twelve hours. If they are pulled out again, even a god descending from heaven would be powerless!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood up, his face slightly pale.</p><p>Hao Xinmei quickly moved forward and grabbed Zhu Tianlei's arm. She could clearly feel the chill emanating from him; it was freezing in midsummer.</p><p>Having said that, without waiting for Director Ke to respond, Zhu Tianlei turned and left. As he passed Xue Ping, she couldn't help but shiver.</p><p>Shen Junfeng watched as Zhu Tianlei's figure disappeared behind the screen corner of the emergency area. In an instant, his gaze fell on the nearby monitoring instruments, and he was stunned into silence.</p><p>"Systolic pressure 109, diastolic pressure 71, heart rate 62/min."</p><p>Everyone in the room had faces like Shen Junfeng's, staring at the data on the monitors with wide eyes.</p><p>"Miracle doctor!"</p><p>After a moment, Ke Yong, who was over forty and known for his strictness and rigor, slowly uttered two words.</p><p>"Tianlei, your face looks very pale. Are you alright?"</p><p>In the car, Hao Xinmei worriedly looked at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Hehe, just kiss me once and I'll be fine!"</p><p>"You're so naughty!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei was truly helpless with Zhu Tianlei but knew that he was a smooth-talking man with a good heart who had saved her from danger several times. She couldn't bring herself to hate such a man.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Hao Xinmei's pretty profile, his lips curling into a smile. Suddenly feeling drowsy, he simply closed his eyes and fell asleep.</p><p>"Tianlei, Tianlei, wake up! Don't scare me!"</p><p>In a daze, Zhu Tianlei heard what sounded like a woman's sobs near his ear, coming and going, and calling out his name.</p><p>Was he dreaming?</p><p>"Tianlei, wake up!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt his eyelids heavy and his head dizzy; for a moment, he forgot where he was. However, the constant sobbing of the woman caused a sharp pain in his heart. He struggled hard and finally opened his eyes.</p><p>In front of him, Hao Xinmei's eyes were filled with tears, her cheeks flushed red, and she almost collapsed on Zhu Tianlei's body.</p><p>"Little Mei, are you trying to molest me?"</p><p>When Hao Xinmei heard Zhu Tianlei's voice, her tears flowed even more fiercely. She clenched her fists and pounded them repeatedly against his chest.</p><p>"You villain, do you know how scared I was? I thought you were dead... wuwu..."</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was baffled by Hao Xinmei's actions. He had just slept for a while due to being tired; why did this girl keep saying he was going to die? It wasn't like she hated him so much that she would curse him.</p><p>"You've been sleeping for more than six hours, and I couldn't wake you up no matter how I called."</p><p>"What? Six hours?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sat up in surprise, forgetting that Hao Xinmei's half-body was still on top of his. With the force, Hao Xinmei's back instantly pressed against the handbrake handle, causing her to let out a stifled groan.</p><p>Panicked, Zhu Tianlei tried to lift Hao Xinmei, but unexpectedly grabbed her dress at the side instead.</p><p>Snip!</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei looked at her dress being torn by Zhu Tianlei and instinctively screamed.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt awkward; this time, he really hadn't meant to do it.</p>

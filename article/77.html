						<p>This question had been swirling in Yang Hua's mind, refusing to be dismissed. He had always wanted to suppress his curiosity, but he couldn't hold back in the end.</p><p>"Xiao Yu contracted a common form of psoriasis, but Qi Xuehua gave Pang Lan maosha grass. Although maosha grass is not toxic by itself, it is fatal for those with psoriasis. It can cause psoriasis to break and become infected, directly affecting internal organs such as the heart. Taking an overdose could lead to organ failure and death."</p><p>Yang Hua drew a sharp breath. He had always known that Pang Lan was malicious, but he never imagined she would be so vicious. As for Qi Xuehua, she truly was a beast in human skin!</p><p>"As for how I found out, it's because I smelled a strong scent of maosha grass on Pang Lan and then asked Xiao Yu. Naturally, I knew the truth."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke simply and casually, but Yang Hua was already completely convinced.</p><p>"Tianlei, are you really not considering staying at the hospital?"</p><p>Yang Hua's disappointment was no less than that of his teacher Song Binyao.</p><p>"I can't leave Hamagou."</p><p>"But what if you didn't have to stay at the hospital all the time and only occasionally make house calls?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback.</p><p>"Occasional house calls? Would that be possible?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei's puzzled expression, Yang Hua's eyes lit up instantly. Zhu Tianlei's reaction had given him his answer.</p><p>A man in his forties suddenly laughed like a child.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Yang Hua's inexplicable laughter and, without an explanation from the other party, did not inquire further. When he got on the returning bus to Hamagou, he saw Yang Hua suddenly jump up and spin around on the spot through the rear window.</p><p>Had he won the lottery?</p><p>The bus jolted along the road at a steady pace.</p><p>Hou Suqin was illiterate, Zhu Quezi had only completed elementary school, but he could still recognize the four characters "business license." However, he didn't understand why his son would place this document before them, or where it came from.</p><p>"Dad, don't you open and take a look?"</p><p>The parents' reaction made Zhu Tianlei feel helpless. Seeing the two of them sitting there like puppets without any response, Zhu Tianlei could only initiate the conversation.</p><p>"Open and take a look?"</p><p>"Yes, Dad, take a look at what it says inside."</p><p>Zhu Quezi looked at his son's expectant face. Although he didn't know what was going on in his son's mind, he followed his son's instructions and opened the business license.</p><p>"Tianlei Medicine?"</p><p>The moment Zhu Quezi finished reading it, Hou Suqin immediately leaned over.</p><p>"Dad Tianlei, what did you say? What does this say?"</p><p>"Dad, Mom, I formally announce to both of you that your son, me, Zhu Tianlei, has registered a company!"</p><p>Zhu Quezi and Hou Suqin stared at their son in disbelief, then looked at the large red book in their hands, feeling as if they were dreaming.</p><p>His son had opened a company?</p><p>They had never dared to dream about such a thing before, but it had actually come true?</p><p>That night, Zhu Quezi and Hou Suqin left the business license exposed in their bed, even lighting a lamp to check on it twice when they went to the toilet in the middle of the night.</p><p>A person's life can change with just one step!</p><p>At the entrance of Zhu Family Lane, as soon as Zhu Tianlei stepped out, someone pulled him into a nearby tree grove.</p><p>"Yún Táo?"</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei saw that it was Zhang Yuntao pulling him, he felt quite good.</p><p>Compared to Ma Lanlan and Yang Xiaoxue, Zhang Yuntao made him feel even more at a loss. Zhang Yuntao's thoughts were more sensitive than most people, and she had a deep-seated sense of inferiority. Getting Zhang Yuntao to completely open up was not an easy task.</p><p>"Tianlei, I......I have something to talk to you about!"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao lowered her head slightly, her cheeks flushed red, her voice so low it seemed as if she was squeezing it out from the back of her throat.</p><p>"Your matter is mine. Go ahead and tell me!"</p><p>"I......I......I that......that......"</p><p>After Zhang Yuntao talked for a long time, she still couldn't explain herself clearly, which left Zhu Tianlei thoroughly confused and worried.</p><p>"Which one? Yuntao, there's nothing we can't talk about before. Just go ahead!"</p><p>"I want you to take a look at......my stomach hurts!"</p><p>Oh!</p><p>Only then did Zhu Tianlei realize what it was. No wonder Zhang Yuntao was so embarrassed to speak up.</p><p>"Are you having your period now?"</p><p>"Yeah, the flow is particularly heavy. Not only does my stomach hurt, but I can't even get up because my back aches!"</p><p>At first, she was embarrassed, but once she opened her mouth, it became much easier to talk.</p><p>"Yuntao, there's a pile of hay over there. Lie down on it, and I'll take care of you!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced around and spotted a hay bale nearby. He pointed at it and said to Zhang Yuntao, "You really can cure?"</p><p>"Magic hands!"</p><p>As soon as Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, Zhang Yuntao's face turned bright red. The words 'magic hands' made an inexplicable image appear in her mind, making her feel flushed all over.</p><p>However, Zhang Yuntao was extremely trusting of Zhu Tianlei's medical skills, so she walked to the hay bale with a blushing face and slowly lay down on it.</p><p>Underneath her white blouse, the contours of her mountains and valleys could be faintly seen, trembling slightly with each breath. The morning light fell upon her, making the blouse seem almost transparent.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's lips curled up in a smile as he squatted beside Zhang Yuntao, his eyes twinkling with amusement.</p>

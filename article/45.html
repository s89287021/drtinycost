						<p>Zhu Tianlei didn't say much else. With his own woman, he could be as playful and naughty as he wanted. If she was in a fit of anger, there was no point in reasoning with her; it might even fuel the fire. Sure enough, Ma Lanlan's struggles gradually ceased, her head resting on Zhu Tianlei's chest as she quietly sobbed.</p><p>"Lanlan, I'm the one who's at fault. Don't cry! If you're feeling upset, hit me a couple of times!"</p><p>Seeing the bold and fiery Ma Lanlan lying pitifully in his arms, Zhu Tianlei's heart tightened. He had thought about such situations before but still felt somewhat flustered when faced with reality.</p><p>"Wu wu... She's so beautiful, wealthy, and influential; she could be of great help to you. I'm just a farmer without any education or notable looks. I..."</p><p>Ma Lanlan had always been proud. She was the first college graduate in her village, beautiful from a young age, and had been pursued by boys throughout school. After graduation, she returned to her village as a doctor. She had always felt like a golden phoenix.</p><p>But today, upon meeting Hao Xinmei, her confidence and pride were ruthlessly shattered. She didn't have the capital to compete with others.</p><p>"Good Lanlan, in my heart, you're the best, unique. You're beautiful, and my biggest dream since childhood was to marry you one day. Don't think like that; Hao Xinmei has her advantages, but you have qualities she can't match!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan raised her head with tear-stained eyes.</p><p>"What qualities?"</p><p>"This one here, much larger than hers. I love large ones the most; don't you know?"</p><p>Ma Lanlan had genuinely wanted to hear Zhu Tianlei's explanation but was shocked when he ended up saying such a thing. Instantly enraged and embarrassed, she clenched her fists and punched Zhu Tianlei in the chest repeatedly.</p><p>She didn't know how many times she hit him until her hands felt numb and swollen with pain. When she saw Zhu Tianlei biting his lip, clearly enduring it, her heart panicked.</p><p>"Are you okay? Did I hurt you? Why didn't you dodge?"</p><p>"As long as you're not angry, even if they kill me, I'll be willing!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan originally wanted to be angry, but upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, all her rage dissipated. She could only let out a light sigh.</p><p>Who made her fall in love with this handsome man!</p><p>"Lanlan, I like you, really!"</p><p>After a while, Zhu Tianlei lowered his head and said softly.</p><p>Ma Lanlan raised her head and looked into Zhu Tianlei's clear eyes, where emotions were swirling. All her anger finally vanished, and she kissed him when he leaned in.</p><p>Their lips met, and Ma Lanlan felt her heart almost jump out of her chest.</p><p>This was her first kiss, given to the person she loved most. She thought it all worthwhile!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei initially only intended to take a light taste, but the innocence and fragrance between their tongues ignited like gunpowder instantly.</p><p>His tongue danced around Ma Lanlan's, while his hands impatiently roamed over her body, soft as mountains, vast as plains.</p><p>In the dark room, Zhu Tianlei's hand explored unfamiliar yet familiar territory. Ma Lanlan had long lost her rationality, collapsing in Zhu Tianlei's arms, submitting to his desires, even responding with her own awkwardness.</p><p>"Lanlan!"</p><p>Heavens!</p><p>How many times was this?</p><p>If this continued, he, Zhu Tianlei, would surely be childless.</p><p>"Mom, what is it?"</p><p>Ma Lanlan was also startled and quickly freed herself from Zhu Tianlei's embrace, hurriedly tidying her hair and clothes.</p><p>Her underwear had already been pulled down by Zhu Tianlei. If he had gone further...</p><p>Ma Lanlan couldn't describe her feelings; she was both relieved and regretful that the situation had been interrupted.</p><p>"Is Tianlei here? Why didn't you turn on the lights?"</p><p>Jiang was still sharp as ever!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei silently rejoiced, thankful that he hadn't gone too far. If his future mother-in-law had caught him, he might never lift his head again.</p><p>"Oh, the light is broken. Tianlei is fixing it right now! It'll be done soon!"</p><p>"Right, right, Auntie, it'll be done soon!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei caught Ma Lanlan's glance and quickly pulled a chair under the faulty lamp before standing on it.</p><p>"Mom, you went to visit neighbors today, didn't you? You're back early!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan opened the door and smiled at her mother, though her smile seemed guilty.</p><p>Niao Fengyun didn't respond to her daughter but instead stared around with wide eyes, paying special attention to the bedding on the kang bed.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt a chill run down his spine; this future mother-in-law was too formidable!</p><p>"The light is fixed!"</p><p>"Oh, let me try it!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan hurried to the switch and flicked it on with a snap, lighting up the lamp.</p><p>"Thank you, Tianlei. If not for you, I would have been in the dark tonight!"</p><p>"Don't be so polite, I just happened to be around. If there's nothing else, I'll head out."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei could clearly sense the murderous intent emanating from Miao Fengyun's body. In a place of right and wrong, it was better for him to leave quickly.</p><p>"Auntie, I'm heading back now. There's still work at the clinic!"</p><p>"Stay for a meal!"</p><p>"No thanks, Auntie, I've finished eating. I'll be off!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said that and dashed out of the house, almost flying to the village entrance in one stride.</p><p>Miao Fengyun then examined her daughter again carefully, her probing and suspicious gaze making Ma Lanlan nervous.</p><p>Fortunately, Miao Fengyun didn't say anything else, and Ma Lanlan breathed a sigh of relief, secretly resolving to be extra cautious around Zhu Tianlei in the future.</p><p>Because he was preoccupied with the research results, Zhu Tianlei slept very restlessly that night and woke up the next morning with dark circles under his eyes.</p><p>"Leizi, what's wrong with you?"</p><p>Seeing her son Wu Qing's eyes, Hou Suqin was startled.</p><p>Their son was now successful, making them feel proud. However, seeing him busy treating villagers' illnesses these days, not eating or sleeping properly, she couldn't help but worry.</p><p>"Mom, it's nothing, just have me some egg drop soup to replenish my strength!"</p><p>"You, this child...... Alright, wait there, I'll make you some egg drop soup."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei walked into the courtyard, stretched a few times, then fetched a basin of water and washed his face. Just as he was about to head back inside, his phone rang.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was extremely excited, quickly pulling out his phone.</p><p>"Tianlei, the results are in. I'm driving over right now!"</p><p>"Little Mei, stop bothering, let me go!"</p><p>"What's the point of discussing this between us two?"</p><p>Ding ding ding.......</p><p>Before Zhu Tianlei could say anything more, a busy signal came from the other end of the phone.</p><p>Less than nine o'clock, Hao Xinmei's car was parked outside the clinic. This time, Ma Lanlan's expression was much calmer, though not particularly warm. After pouring Hao Xinmei a glass of water, she sat down at the table to look at the medical records.</p><p>"Tianlei, here are the test results."</p>

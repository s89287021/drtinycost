						<p>Hey?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had just strolled into the main hall when he heard people talking in the courtyard. He peered out and saw his father sitting on a stone bench in the yard, with Hu Daniu sitting opposite him.</p><p>"Leizi!"</p><p>Hu Daniu spotted Zhu Tianlei standing at the door and immediately stood up, the gratitude in his eyes unchanged from before.</p><p>"Uncle Hu has come, how is Uncle Hu's health these days?"</p><p>"Much better, Uncle Hu is as strong as a bull, he’s back to normal after a good sleep!"</p><p>Hu Daniu looked at Zhu Tianlei more favorably the longer he stared.</p><p>"Haha, that's great. Then Uncle Hu, you can continue chatting with my father. I'll go take a walk!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't really like Hu Daniu. With Hu Daniu’s better-off family background, he naturally had an air of superiority. More importantly, thinking about Hu Daniu hugging Chen Laowu made Zhu Tianlei extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>"Tianlei, quickly tell Uncle Hu that we can't accept this money. We're neighbors, what does this mean!"</p><p>Money?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was stunned and only then realized that Hu Daniu was holding a stack of hundred-dollar bills, pink notes gleaming with an enticing sheen, as captivating as a naked beauty.</p><p>At a glance, it seemed to be at least five or six thousand!</p><p>"Leizi, Uncle Hu is a straightforward man who doesn't say fancy words. These eight thousand yuan are my way of showing you my gratitude, take them!"</p><p>Eight thousand!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's heart tightened. His family’s six acres of land, after working hard all year round, could net them around five or six thousand yuan in good years after deducting the cost of seeds and fertilizers, but if it was a bad year, they might only get about four or five thousand.</p><p>Eight thousand dollars is the entire family's income for a year!</p><p>"Uncle Hu, although I, Zhu Tianlei, am young and used to partying in the past, I still know what can be done and what cannot. If I accept Uncle Hu's money, how will I face people in the village in the future? Uncle Hu, please take back your money!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said with a pained expression, saying one thing but meaning another.</p><p>"That's right, Uncle Hu. What my son says is correct; this money under no circumstances can be accepted!"</p><p>Zhu Quezi sincerely refused and was thoroughly satisfied with his son's performance, speaking confidently. Seeing his father's attitude, Zhu Tianlei felt that if he gave up the eight thousand dollars, it would make his father happy.</p><p>"Then Uncle Hu won't insist. I came today actually for another matter; Elder Brother Zhu must promise to help me!"</p><p>Hu Daniu was also straightforward, putting the money back in his pocket. Zhu Tianlei twitched his mouth corner, trying to appear calm on the surface.</p><p>As for money, he, Zhu Tianlei, would have plenty later on. Eight thousand dollars was just a drop in the bucket!</p><p>"What matter?"</p><p>When Hu Daniu said he needed help, Zhu Quezi subconsciously got nervous. His Zhu family had always been an insignificant presence in the village, and what could someone as wealthy as the Hu family need help with?</p><p>"Elder Brother Zhu, to be frank, I've been preparing to expand my toad processing factory recently. Once the scale expands, there won't be enough manpower, so I want Elder Brother Zhu and your sister-in-law to come help me. It's not heavy work; just inspecting the quality of the toad skins that come in."</p><p>Hu Daniu looked earnestly at Zhu Quezi, paused for a moment, and seeing that Zhu Quezi was somewhat bewildered, he continued.</p><p>"Fifty dollars per month, lunch provided. Elder Brother Zhu must give your brother this favor!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Hu Daniu, who was clearly trying to indirectly give them money. To be honest, just for this point alone, Hu Daniu wasn't a bad person; he knew how to repay favors.</p><p>However, he didn't want to interfere with this matter. Whether or not to go would depend on his father's decision.</p><p>Zhu Quezi stared blankly for a while, looking at Hu Daniu and then at his son who seemed lost in thought, wrestling internally.</p><p>A monthly salary of five hundred yuan, added together for the old couple, that's a thousand yuan. Lei was about to get married, and nowadays, without three or five ten-thousand-yuan, don't even think about it.</p><p>"He Uncle Hu, I'll go!"</p><p>Zhu Quezi was still hesitating. Hou Suqin, who had been cooking in the house, came out at an unknown time, wiping the water from her hands with her apron and said resolutely, "Alright then, Brother Zhu, Sister-in-law, I'll be heading back now. Once things are sorted out at the factory, I'll send you a message!"</p><p>Hu Dainiu seemed very happy, his face lighting up with a smile as he got up to greet Zhu Tianlei before taking large strides out of the courtyard.</p><p>"Lei, it's time for you to get married. Your dad and I have been thinking about it, and in these few days, I'll ask Auntie Fat to find you a suitable girl. Get married early, so your dad and I can soon hold our grandchild!"</p><p>Hou Suqin finally said the words she had kept inside her for over half a month during dinner.</p><p>"Mom, I'm only twenty-one, still young, no rush!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was eating noodles without even raising his head, mumbling softly.</p><p>"How young are you? Old Liu's second son is a year younger than you, and that kid can already run around everywhere. Just do as your dad and I say!"</p><p>Hou Suqin made the final decision.</p><p>"Alright, as long as you and my dad are happy. But don't be too picky about my bride!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei laughed and jumped off the kang just as Hou Suqin's chopsticks were about to hit his head.</p><p>Hou Suqin shook her head, both amused and irritated. However, the atmosphere at home was now much better than before, and while she was cleaning up the dishes, she hummed a little tune.</p><p>Listening to his mother humming, Zhu Tianlei started pondering his life.</p><p>In the past, he had been an idle youth without any qualifications or skills, and with no money at home, he felt that his life would be like this, living in Toad Valley and spending his entire life honestly.</p><p>But now, everything is different. He must re-plan his life.</p><p>The pressing matter is to earn money. For a man, the foundation of survival is to have one's own business and make money, support parents and wife and children, but what should he do to earn money?</p><p>Be a barefoot doctor?</p><p>No, the government enforces strict regulations, and practitioners without proper credentials will be jailed if caught practicing medicine.</p><p>Follow Dr. Liu from the city hospital to work in the hospital?</p><p>It doesn't seem feasible either. Although his medical skills are high, it's a regular hospital where he would definitely face exclusion, and there are many rules. As someone who has been used to being carefree since childhood, he probably couldn't handle it.</p><p>After much thought, Zhu Tianlei suddenly remembered Hu Daniu.</p><p>Right, live off the land, he Zhu Tianlei not only knows how to treat illnesses but also how to prepare medicines; in the book "Immortal Medical Techniques," there are countless formulas for concocting elixirs and miraculous drugs.</p><p>Hagamo Gou is full of mountains and forests, with plenty of herbs. He could definitely produce and sell medicine!</p><p>Haha, as soon as this idea popped into his head, Zhu Tianlei got excited, rubbing his hands together, carefully calculating in his mind until he finally succumbed to sleepiness late that night.</p><p>The next morning, after breakfast, Zhu Tianlei pulled out a half-sized basket from the shed and told Hou Suqin before heading to Heihu Forest with the basket on his back.</p>

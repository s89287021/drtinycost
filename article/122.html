						<p>"Hmm? No?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei gave a mischievous smile. The small boat sped up, delving deeper into the creek. Hao Xinmei felt as if she had been thrown into an oven, desperately trying to dispel the terrifying heat while simultaneously craving to be scorched by flames.</p><p>"Ah...... Tianlei......"</p><p>"Do you want it?"</p><p>"Yes, yes......"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled in satisfaction and got on his horse with a gun.</p><p>Leaves danced outside as autumn's heat raged on, but inside the house, spring was lush and intimate.</p><p>......</p><p>"How many pharmacies refused to be agents for the medicine?"</p><p>After another half-hour of torment, Zhu Tianlei finally let Hao Xinmei go. Leaning against Zhu Tianlei's chest, she spoke intermittently. When she heard about a few pharmacies refusing to be agents for the beauty pill, she sat up in surprise.</p><p>"What were those pharmacies called? Do you remember?"</p><p>"I do!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's memory was extraordinary. Not only could he recall several pharmacies but even if he saw a page filled with words at a glance, he could memorize most of it.</p><p>"Yongsheng Grand Pharmacy is one of my franchisees. They were discussing a few days ago whether they could be supplied with some beauty pills."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned. What kind of act was this?</p><p>"There must be something fishy about this. I'll find the time to talk to their boss and get the scoop."</p><p>This trip to Yunhai City, Zhu Tianlei not only resolved his doubts but also indulged in intimate moments with a beautiful woman, leaving him feeling overjoyed. Upon returning, Zhu Tianlei reported the sales situation of the beauty pill on the market to Mao Yu. Both Mao Yu and Han Lin, along with other key management members, were extremely pleased. The group immediately held a small meeting, adjusting the market sales direction and strategies, everyone feeling highly motivated and full of hope for the future. With Hao Xinmei securing an exclusive agency, the sales of the beauty pill required little effort, even the market promotion work was handled by Hao Xinmei.</p><p>However, just as everything seemed to be progressing smoothly...</p><p>"Mr. Zhu, quickly, come see the news."</p><p>Midday, right after lunch, Tu Feng rushed into Zhu Tianlei's office panting. Under Tu Feng's explanation, Zhu Tianlei opened 'Yunhai Minsheng', a popular TV program focused on national and public welfare issues, which ranked first among similar programs in terms of viewership. On the screen, a young girl, about seventeen or eighteen years old, was lying on the ground, groaning in pain while clutching her stomach, with a pharmacy in the background. A reporter from Yunhai Minsheng was interviewing the crowd gathered around.</p><p>"Madam, as a witness, do you know what caused this little girl to collapse on the ground?"</p><p>"I heard she ate some medicine that upset her stomach and came here for an explanation, but she ended up in extreme pain..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned.</p><p>"Are you a salesperson from this pharmacy? Could you please give us a brief description of the situation?"</p><p>The reporter found a salesperson inside the pharmacy, but the salesperson immediately covered his face with his hand.</p><p>"I don't know, don't ask me, I'm just an employee..."</p><p>At that moment, two people rushed into the camera frame, looking like relatives of the little girl.</p><p>"Daughter, my daughter, what happened to you? You were fine when she left home. What’s wrong with her?"</p><p>It was the mother of the little girl.</p><p>"Hello, may I ask if you are the mother of this little girl? Could you please tell me what happened?"</p><p>"My daughter is a student at Yunhai University. One morning, this child said she had an upset stomach, so I gave her two tablets of Meiyandan that I bought two days ago, and then she left home. I just heard someone say that she collapsed in front of the pharmacy door, so I ran all the way here. Reporter, you must help us get justice!"</p><p>This woman was holding her daughter while speaking excitedly; the word 'Meiyandan' sounded crystal clear yet painfully sharp.</p><p>"Don't worry, we at Yunhai People's Livelihood are a program specifically for the voice of the people. If the issue truly exists, we will definitely help you seek justice."</p><p>At this moment, a line appeared below the screen: The ‘Catastrophe’ Caused by Meiyandan.</p><p>Tu Feng looked at the screen and then at Zhu Tianlei; both knew what this program meant for the newly established Tianlei Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>"Hmph, to topple me, Zhu Tianlei, one must have the ability."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei snorted coldly and then left the office like a gust of wind.</p><p>Tu Feng was stunned for a moment before rushing to Maoyu's office to report the news. He saw how terrifying Mr. Zhu’s face looked just now; he had to make sure nothing drastic happened.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei got into his car, pressing the accelerator almost to the floor and speeding off like a sharp sword.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zhu Tianlei's phone began ringing incessantly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not want to answer them, so he muted all calls.</p><p>Half an hour later, Zhu Tianlei arrived at the pharmacy mentioned in the news. The crowd had yet to disperse, indicating that the issue remained unresolved.</p><p>This is precisely what Zhu Tianlei wanted.</p><p>"Beauty Elixir is produced by Tianlei Pharmaceutical. It has always sold well in our store, and we had no idea the drug would cause any issues. We are just agents; if there's a problem with the medication, it should be Tianlei Pharmaceutical's responsibility. You should go to them if you want to find someone."</p><p>The person speaking in the crowd was the pharmacy owner, a middle-aged greasy uncle who kept repeating 'Tianlei Pharmaceutical' as if afraid that no one would hear him clearly.</p><p>An ambulance was parked outside. As Zhu Tianlei squeezed through the crowd, two doctors and a nurse were performing CPR.</p><p>The girl's mother sat on the side, her expression oddly numb.</p><p>"Hey kid, what are you doing? Don't get too close; these days people can be so bad. If you go up there, watch out for trouble!"</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was about to move forward, an elderly woman in her seventies grabbed his arm and gently tried to persuade him.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled and headed straight towards the fallen girl.</p><p>"Let me check on her condition."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words immediately drew attention from those around him. The reporter from Yunhai People's Livelihood also recognized Zhu Tianlei as the vice president of Meixin Pharmaceutical who had made a scene in the arbitration hall that day.</p><p>One of the doctors participating in the CPR turned around.</p><p>"Are you... you?"</p><p>Xue Ping was surprised to see Zhu Tianlei again, this time at the scene of an emergency.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei recognized Xue Ping too, but his expression remained calm and unaffected.</p><p>"Okay, go check her out!"</p><p>Xue Ping hesitated slightly before speaking up.</p><p>"Senior sister, this is a violation of our work regulations, and besides, this person isn't a doctor. We..."</p><p>Upon hearing Xue Ping's words, another little girl spoke up.</p><p>"He is Zhu Tianlei."</p><p>What?</p><p>The name Zhu Tianlei instantly silenced the little girl. In the emergency center, apart from Director Ke Yong, the most renowned and well-known figure was Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>His miraculous hand that day had become a legend and myth in the emergency center.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said nothing more and squatted down where Xue Ping had moved aside, gently pressing on the little girl's wrist with his hand.</p>

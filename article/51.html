						<p>"You don't push me, Zhu Tianlei. Why do you always have to meddle? Do you want money? I'll give you money, how about it? Thirty thousand, right in the card. As long as you don't interfere, thirty thousand is yours!"</p><p>Li Xu knew that Zhu Tianlei's family conditions were not good either; he could tell just by looking at the clothes Zhu Tianlei wore.</p><p>"Thirty thousand is a bit too little, isn't it?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei snorted and continued walking forward.</p><p>"You stand there! Don't walk any further. Take one more step, and I'll act!"</p><p>Now Li Xu was like a scared rabbit. He was afraid of Zhu Tianlei, afraid of his terrifying strength that could kill anything in an instant, but he also feared the chairman, afraid that he would lose his job as assistant to the chairman.</p><p>Li Xu had worked hard for ten years, climbing up from university with countless hardships and countless setbacks, only to reach his current position. If he lost this job, there was little difference between living and dying.</p><p>"Act? Then go ahead, but let's see who is faster... I'll move fast!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei paused, but in that moment, he suddenly teleported on the spot. Li Xu felt a flash before his eyes, a sharp pain in his wrist, and then the dagger clanged to the ground.</p><p>The moment Yao Gang escaped, he immediately collapsed onto the nearby sofa, too weak to even lift himself up.</p><p>"How about it, Assistant Li? Was I faster?"</p><p>Li Xu's arms were held by Zhu Tianlei; the frantic strength had instantly vanished. His face was now ashen.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei reached out, and Li Xu shivered in fear.</p><p>"Your glasses are crooked!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei laughed as he gently adjusted the crooked glasses on Li Xu's side. Only then did Li Xu realize that his back was already soaked with sweat.</p><p>"Assistant Li, I'm taking this item with me, and I'll take Village Head Yao back too. See you later!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei finished speaking and reached out to pick up the contract. The words on it, "Hagamoog Land Transfer Contract," were unusually clear.</p><p>"No, you can't take it away!"</p><p>The words on the contract felt like a bomb exploding in Li Xu's head suddenly. He lunged crazily towards the contract in Zhu Tianlei's hands.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei raised his hand and held the contract above his head, with a hint of coldness in his eyes.</p><p>He had already shown mercy, but this Li Xu seemed unyielding and remorseless.</p><p>"Assistant Li, I'm already very angry. Don't provoke me any further!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked coldly at Li Xu, who kept snatching the contract from his hands like a mad dog. His anger was almost unbearable.</p><p>"You can't take away the contract. Give it back to me!"</p><p>Li Xu desperately tried to reclaim the contract, but Zhu Tianlei had decided to take it away.</p><p>"I heard that your Shengshi Group started with building materials and that your boss is a vegetarian who prays, but seeing you makes me doubt whether he's really a vegetarian or praying at all. He would actually trust someone like you!"</p><p>Thinking of how Hao Xinmei spoke about the chairman of Shengshi Group with respect, Zhu Tianlei recalled the saying, "If the beams are not straight, the rafters will be askew." A boss who allowed Li Xu, such a shameless person, to act freely couldn't be good.</p><p>"Youth, watch your mouth!"</p><p>This man was slightly overweight, with rosy cheeks, puffy eyes, pale lips, and sharp eyes like those of an eagle or falcon.</p><p>"D-Director..."!</p><p>"Are you Mr. Min Shengjun, the boss of Shengshi Group?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hesitated before speaking. Honestly, someone with this build didn't look like they had been abstaining from meat for a long time.</p><p>"I am Min Shengjun, young man. Why are you causing such a commotion in the company and having an argument with Assistant Li?"</p><p>Min Shengjun spoke smoothly, making it hard to dislike him.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was always one who didn't provoke others and didn't get provoked himself; now that the other party was treating him politely, he couldn't afford to be too rude.</p><p>"Do I have to ask you, Chairman?"</p><p>"Ask me? Young man, what do you mean by this? We've never met before, right?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei rolled his eyes. He hadn't even met that Zhao Zhiguo yet, and still, the other party had been targeting and framing him at every turn.</p><p>Hatred in this world has nothing to do with whether people have ever seen each other or not.</p><p>"Does the Chairman really say he doesn't know about this contract?"</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei casually picked up one of the contracts from his stack and tossed it over to Min Shengjun, curious to see what Min would say.</p><p>Min Shengjun took the contract and looked at Zhu Tianlei strangely before lowering his head and carefully reviewing the entire document.</p><p>Min Shengjun had already seen the contract before, so Zhu Tianlei's words seemed baffling to him. However, upon seeing Li Xu, his eyebrows involuntarily furrowed.</p><p>Min Shengjun's face suddenly darkened.</p><p>"Assistant Li, what exactly is this young man talking about?"</p><p>Min Shengjun felt his blood boiling after hearing Zhu Tianlei's words. He was afraid that the land acquisition would lead to conflicts with the villagers, which was why he had carefully selected Li Xu to handle this matter. For a year, Li Xu had regularly reported back on the situation and progress to him. Just three days ago, he had informed Min Shengjun that he had finally convinced the villagers and that they were about to sign the contract.</p><p>But what was happening now?</p><p>Li Xu had a deep-seated respect and fear for Min Shengjun. He originally wanted to deny his actions, but the words got stuck in his throat.</p><p>"What did you actually do?"</p><p>"I... I had some people put parasites in the water tanks of several households and Xiaohei Stream..."</p><p>"You actually......"</p><p>"General Min!"</p><p>Min Shengjun's head spun, and he felt a surge of blood rush to his forehead. Then everything went dark, and he collapsed on the ground.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei watched as this unfolded. Was Min Shengjun truly unaware of what was happening?</p><p>Or was it an act between a superior and subordinate?</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you can treat people, right? Please save General Min!"</p>

						<p>Looking at the several people rushing towards him like tigers, Zhu Tianlei remained in place. However, just as their fists were about to land on the target, Zhu Tianlei lightly sidestepped and moved two steps away. When they attacked again, Zhu Tianlei effortlessly dodged them once more. "One, two, but not three, Inspector Mu. This is what you’re forcing me to do!" Zhu Tianlei spoke these words in a light, almost carefree tone, as if a goose feather was brushing across his heart, tingling with a hint of mischief. When Mu Kun worked at the Public Security Inspection Bureau, his temper and martial skills were renowned. He even had a nickname, 'Northeast Tiger,' known for his powerful builds and ruthless techniques. There was an incident where he accidentally broke two ribs of a vendor who was illegally peddling goods. At this moment, Mu Kun lunged for Zhu Tianlei's shoulders with both hands, truly deserving his title of Northeast Tiger; his punches carried the force of gale winds, and his palm strikes were like iron fists. In front of Zhu Tianlei, a majestic tiger seemed to materialize—tiger-striped fur, glaring eyes, ferocious beyond measure. Zhu Tianlei suddenly recalled the story of Wu Song fighting the tiger, and a surge of heroic spirit surged through him. Almost instantly, he grabbed Mu Kun's wrist, shook his forearm slightly, and sent Mu Kun soaring through the air before crashing into the medicine cabinet with a thud. The others didn’t even touch Zhu Tianlei; they were flipped over by him and tumbled to the ground in a heap. "Zhu Tianlei, you’re resisting law enforcement violently—aren’t you afraid of going to jail?" Mu Kun stood up, looking at Zhu Tianlei coldly. Zhu Tianlei gently moved his hands in front of his eyes and curled his lips into a slight grin. "Whether I go to jail or not might not be something Inspector Mu can decide, but it seems that this newly appointed Deputy Inspector is about to get dismissed." "What do you mean?" Mu Kun was clearly losing ground; Zhu Tianlei was proving to be an incredibly difficult opponent, the toughest he had ever faced. "Inspector Mu should understand my meaning after seeing this item. Jianxiong, show Inspector Mu what it is."</p><p>"You...you...how could you possibly..."</p><p>Mu Kun skimmed through the contents of the file folder, his heart finally losing all warmth. The file folder in his hand fell to the ground like a shattered stone plummeting into a deep valley with a thud.</p><p>"Mu Kun, Chairman Zhu Tianlei of Tianlei Pharmaceutical has namedly reported that you are suspected of defaming Zhu Tianlei's personal reputation and corporate reputation through your official position, as well as suspicion of bribery. Please come with us for an investigation."</p><p>At this moment, several individuals in disciplinary inspection uniforms walked in from outside and said to Mu Kun word by word,</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, we'll see about that! Hmph!"</p><p>No matter how bold Mu Kun was, he dared not be extravagant in front of the disciplinary inspection staff. However, he would never let Zhu Tianlei off.</p><p>"Goodbye, Chief Mu! We won't send you off!"</p><p>Mu Kun came with great momentum and made all kinds of preparations, but he returned in a miserable defeat.</p><p>Only after everyone had left did the remaining dealers' emotions become complex again.</p><p>This Zhu Tianlei was young yet so capable. They really needed to be extremely cautious if they wanted to collaborate with him!</p><p>"Everyone, I apologize for the trouble. Chairman Tianlei has prepared a bountiful lunch in the company's reception hall, featuring local specialties from rural areas, to soothe everyone's nerves. Jianxiong, lead everyone there!"</p><p>"Uncle, I really have to thank you!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said with a smile as he looked at Jin Wenbiao, but Jin Wenbiao's expression on the other side was somewhat awkward.</p><p>"Chairman Zhu, please don't tease me..."</p><p>Jin Wenbiao wore an unnatural expression, recalling the scene when Zhu Tianlei had discovered his true identity; he still felt a burning sensation on his face.</p><p>"Deputy Jin, if you can return to the right path, we will not bring up the past. I will continue to call you my uncle, and I hope you visit our house from time to time, as your grandmother often mentions you."</p><p>"If General Zhu can forgive me and give me this chance, I must take it!"</p><p>Jin Wenbiao was surprised by Zhu Tianlei's words. Although he felt ashamed, a weight had been lifted off his heart.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled and pulled Mao Yu, who looked completely baffled, out of the room.</p><p>"Tianlei, what kind of act are you putting on?"</p><p>Mao Yu, seeing through everything now, knew that Zhu Tianlei was clearly luring him into a trap to catch him like a turtle in a jar. However, since she spent every day with Zhu Tianlei, she had no idea when he had done all these things.</p><p>"Xiaoyu, I am sorry. I hid this from you for two reasons: first, I was unsure if things would go as planned, and second, to make the act more convincing so that Mu Kun would lower his guard and fall into the trap I set up."</p><p>Walking outside to a big tree, Zhu Tianlei and Mao Yu stopped in their tracks. Zhu Tianlei turned around and said seriously,</p><p>Mao Yu rolled her eyes.</p><p>"How did you know about Mu Kun's plans? And what was with that uncle business earlier?"</p><p>Mao Yu was indeed somewhat angry, but she understood Zhu Tianlei well enough to know he wasn't untrusting; sometimes men acted more straightforwardly without considering her feelings.</p><p>"That uncle of mine is the deputy director of the county Traditional Chinese Medicine Factory. He joined the factory right after graduation. In recent years, the factory has been struggling and barely breaking even. As the head of business operations, he naturally had to think of ways to expand the company's business and save the enterprise from crisis..."</p><p>In essence, this was a very cliché story. When Zhu Tianlei first noticed the sudden appearance of this uncle, he had been highly curious, despite his busy schedule with factory construction. He hadn't forgotten to investigate Jin Wenbiao.</p><p>For more than half a month, there were no leads. Just when Zhu Tianlei thought it all might be mere conjecture, he discovered that Jin Wenbiao was close to several local leaders, especially Yang County Mayor.</p><p>This Yang County Mayor had a grudge against him, so Zhu Tianlei certainly did not believe this discovery was coincidental.</p><p>Through a thorough investigation that followed the trail, Zhu Tianlei chose a dark and windy night to corner Jin Wenbiao in a narrow alley. After some tough negotiations combined with persuasion, he successfully got Jin Wenbiao to defect.</p><p>So, Jin Wenbiao was an informant arranged by Zhu Tianlei near Mayor Yang and Mu Kun; all of their schemes were under his control.</p><p>"Well done, Zhu Tianlei. You’re quite the master at turning enemies, huh? Looks like Mu Kun is just a mere monkey, completely fooled by you!"</p><p>After hearing Zhu Tianlei’s words, Mao Yu was speechless.</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei’s methods were unconventional, one had to admit that attacking the enemy’s weak point, using this strategy against Mu Kun, was almost magical!</p><p>"Hehe, mere trifles, not worth mentioning."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei rubbed his nose and laughed mockingly.</p>

						<p>When Zhu Tianlei came down from the attic, he saw Mao Yu and Zhang Yi sitting face to face. Although it was a profile view, Zhu Tianlei instantly caught sight of Mao Yu's flushed cheeks and the sparkling glint in her eyes that seemed like stars flickering constantly.</p><p>He glanced at Zhang Yi; his face remained as calm and serene as ever, without any ripples, but there was now an added spark of vitality.</p><p>This......</p><p>Zhu Tianlei briefly explained to Zhang Yi what he had agreed upon with Old Man Yan. The specifics would naturally be arranged by Old Man Yan.</p><p>The result seemed to be within Zhang Yi's expectations; at least, there was not a trace of surprise on his face. However, as the two left, his gaze lingered on Mao Yu with obvious interest.</p><p>"Tianlei, did you know that Zhang Yi is a descendant of Zhang Yu......"</p><p>After getting in the car, Mao Yu excitedly told Zhu Tianlei about Zhang Yi.</p><p>"Zhang Yu?"</p><p>Who was Zhang Yu?</p><p>"During the Three Kingdoms period, apart from Zhuge Liang under Liu Bei's command, there were two other extremely capable people: Zhou Qun and Zhang Yu. Both could be called divine calculators; all their predictions came true. Zhang Yu was even more remarkable; he not only practiced divination but also physiognomy. In Shu Han, he was almost a godlike figure."</p><p>As Mao Yu spoke, she waved her arms to emphasize her points.</p><p>It seemed as if the Zhang Yu she was talking about was her own ancestor rather than Zhang Yi's forebear.</p><p>"No wonder Zhang Yi is so accurate with his predictions; he divined my future and got it spot-on, literally...... Hey, Zhu Tianlei, why are you looking at me like that?"</p><p>Mao Yu, who was enthusiastically sharing her joy with Zhu Tianlei, suddenly felt a searing gaze from the side. She turned to see Zhu Tianlei looking at her with an ambiguous smile. This look could not be one of admiration or affection; it was clearly one of mockery.</p><p>"Xiao Yu, have you been in a relationship before?"</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Máo Yǔ was taken aback. What did he mean by that?</p><p>"When a woman is smitten, she becomes extremely excited when talking about that man, gesturing wildly, acting completely different from her usual self. Look at you, ever since getting in the car, you’ve been calling him Zhang Yi over and over..."</p><p>"Zhū Tiānlěi, what are you saying? I..."</p><p>Máo Yǔ instinctively wanted to argue back. She was exceptionally beautiful and capable, becoming an object of admiration for many people at a young age. However, she had never dated anyone or harbored feelings for any man, regardless of her appreciation for Zhū Tiānlěi, which only went so far as admiration.</p><p>But, recalling the scene they just shared together, her heart skipped a beat, wishing time could remain frozen in that moment. Could this be what falling in love at first sight felt like?</p><p>"Naïve girl, think it through yourself!"</p><p>Seeing the bewildered Mao Yǔ, Zhū Tiānlěi shook his head internally. This girl was ruthless and decisive in business but innocent as a child when it came to emotions.</p><p>To be fair, Zhang Yi was indeed an exceptional talent. Not only did Mao Yǔ admire him, so did he, deeply impressed by him. However, thinking about Zhang Yi’s leg injury made Zhū Tiānlěi slightly disappointed.</p><p>Throughout the journey, Mao Yǔ remained unusually quiet, her head lowered, lost in thought.</p><p>"I will take you to soar everywhere, traveling around the world to admire its beauty, free from worries and sorrow, carefree and relaxed. Forget your pain and that place; we’ll set off on an adventure together.</p><p>Though we may not have luxurious houses or fancy clothes, our hearts are filled with hope..."</p><p>Familiar music echoed in the car as Zhū Tiānlěi hummed along softly. A familiar song often transported one to a specific space, evoking memories tied to that place.</p><p>The car stopped at the entrance of Tiānlěi Pharmaceutical.</p><p>Máo Yǔ suddenly grabbed Zhū Tiānlěi’s arm, her expression somber.</p><p>"Tiānlěi, I’ve thought carefully about what you said earlier."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>I truly do like Zhang Yi, and I want to be with him.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't find it strange; Zhang Yi was indeed a very attractive man. As for his legs, Zhu Tianlei believed he could cure them.</p><p>"I support you, Xiaoyu!"</p><p>The two comrades-in-arms looked at each other, their eyes filled with encouragement and blessings, as well as anticipation and determination.</p><p>One hour later.</p><p>Yan Mumu pushed open the door to Zhu Tianlei's office.</p><p>At seventeen, the girl stood tall and graceful, clearly inheriting her mother's looks.</p><p>"Director, did you call me?"</p><p>In the company, Yan Mumu, like all other employees, addressed Zhu Tianlei as Director.</p><p>"Hmm, sit down first."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei lowered his head to read the city newspaper, idly responding, then fell silent.</p><p>Yan Mumu sat on the sofa, constantly observing Zhu Tianlei's expression. She felt that today's Zhu Tianlei seemed a bit odd.</p><p>A woman's intuition told her that something was about to happen.</p><p>Time ticked by, and Yan Mumu's mood began to grow anxious, while Zhu Tianlei continued to flip through the newspaper, which was clearly still on the same page as before.</p><p>Just as Yan Mumu couldn't bear to ask any longer, a knock sounded from outside, followed by an elegantly handsome young man walking in.</p><p>"Director."</p><p>"Jianxiong big brother......"</p><p>"Xiaomu?"</p><p>The two young men were surprised to see each other.</p><p>"Jianxiong, sit down!"</p><p>Yao Jianxiong was astonished and could not understand why Zhu Tianlei had called him and Mumu to the office together. Apart from regular meetings, whenever there was anything important, Zhu Tianlei would casually mention it. Being formally invited to the office was a first for Yao Jianxiong.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei slowly spoke these words, which were so sudden that Yao Jianxiong was momentarily stunned.</p><p>Yan Mumu, sitting beside him, moved slightly unconsciously.</p><p>"Chairman, you...... do you suspect me of leaking out the formula?"</p><p>Although Yao Jianxiong was young, he was very smart and sensitive. He knew who in the company had access to the formula and was certain that Zhu Tianlei would not ask such a question without reason.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not speak but tapped lightly on the table with his fingers.</p><p>"I...... Chairman, I have been with the company since its inception. You trust me and entrust me with important tasks. There is no way I would do anything to disappoint you or the company."</p><p>Yao Jianxiong was worried by Zhu Tianlei's attitude but did not know how to defend himself.</p><p>"Chairman, Brother Jianxiong has always worked diligently and been loyal to the company. It is absolutely impossible for him to leak out our confidential information."</p><p>Seeing Yao Jianxiong being misunderstood, Yan Mumu could no longer hold back and spoke up in his defense.</p><p>"The formula was sent out from the materials department, and this point is already confirmed. Jianxiong, I also believe that you wouldn't do anything to harm the company. Think about it, besides you, is there anyone else who has come into contact with the formula?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's seemingly casual question made Yao Jianxiong's heart jolt, and he instinctively looked at Yan Mumu.</p>

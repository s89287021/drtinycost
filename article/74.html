						<p>"The president is here! The president is here!"</p><p>A few minutes later, a hurried footsteps were heard at the corner of the staircase.</p><p>An elderly man in a black polo shirt briskly walked over from one end of the corridor.</p><p>"President!"</p><p>Seeing the president approaching, Yang Hua's eyes filled with emotion.</p><p>He was President Song Bosen's student. Over the years, without the president's strong support, it would have been very difficult for him to survive in the hospital, let alone become a department head.</p><p>He had always been grateful, so he worked diligently, afraid of tarnishing his teacher's reputation. But now, seeing his teacher looking exhausted and travel-worn, Yang Hua was moved to the point of choking back tears.</p><p>Qi Xuehua's face was full of surprise!</p><p>Wasn't Song Bosen supposed to be attending a national medical system exchange conference? Why had he suddenly returned?</p><p>"What's going on? There are very few patients in the hospital today?"</p><p>The president wasn't particularly tall, but he was very serious. His voice was not loud, but his presence was intimidating.</p><p>"President, it's like this......"</p><p>Yang Hua was about to speak when Qi Xuehua preempted him, playing the role of accuser.</p><p>"Qi Xuehua, you're slandering me!"</p><p>Qí Xuěhuá spoke with sharpness, pressing the matter forward relentlessly. Yáng Huá was no match for Qí Xuěhuá in terms of argumentative skills and found himself getting increasingly flustered, his eyes almost rolling back.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Song Bǎonián did not comment but instead turned to Zhū Tiānlěi and asked.</p><p>Upon hearing Zhū Tiānlěi’s words, a flicker of smug satisfaction appeared in Qí Xuěhuá's eyes.</p><p>"A village doctor? Do you know where you are, and do you know that your actions violate public health regulations and medical standards?"</p><p>Zhū Tiānlěi looked at Song Bǎonián, blinked, and suddenly laughed.</p><p>"What are these health regulations? If it’s about not providing aid to the dying, I don’t believe there is a need for me to adhere to them. As for medical standards, do they specify that doctors can only save patients in their own hospitals and wards, leaving others to ignore or remain indifferent?"</p><p>Zhū Tiānlěi spoke with composure, his words crisp and clear.</p><p>Song Bǎonián was taken aback; he did not expect the young man in ordinary clothing before him to have such convincing arguments.</p><p>"President Song, this guy is a habitual offender. We now have both the suspect and the evidence. He’s still being so brazen. I’ve already called the police. When they arrive, we’ll see how arrogant he remains."</p><p>Song Bǎonián's expression darkened.</p><p>"Director Qí, aren't you being a bit hasty? The facts haven’t been verified yet, and if word gets out, what will happen to our hospital’s reputation?"</p><p>"President Song, I have evidence. This... Peng Lán is the witness!"</p><p>Qí Xuěhuá suddenly pointed at Peng Lán, who was sitting on a bench outside the corridor, restrained.</p><p>Zhū Tiānlěi raised an eyebrow; it seemed that this matter was not as simple as he thought!</p><p>Pang Lan stared wide-eyed at Qi Xuehua.</p><p>"Pang Lan, tell me, is this person the one who killed your daughter?"</p><p>Qi Xuehua glared fiercely at Zhu Tianlei while pointing at Pang Lan.</p><p>Pang Lan's eyes darted around, cursing Zhu Tianlei in her heart countless times, but she couldn't open her mouth, not even able to move her fingers.</p><p>Seeing Pang Lan remain silent, Qi Xuehua grew so angry that smoke seemed to rise from her eyes.</p><p>"Seal off the scene! No one is allowed to enter or exit!"</p><p>Like a bustling show, before Song Bainian could speak, a group of police officers rushed down the staircase in a clamor.</p><p>And leading them was someone familiar!</p><p>"Good morning, Chief Qiu. I didn't expect your jurisdiction would extend all the way to the county."</p><p>Qiu Ran looked at Zhu Tianlei, sneered, and tugged at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>"You don't know this? I was just transferred to serve as Deputy Director of Dahuo County Public Security Bureau yesterday. Coincidentally, the first case I handled turned out to be yours!"</p><p>Yang Hua's heart tightened. Although he had a gentle disposition, he wasn't stupid; in fact, he was very astute and immediately noticed that this public security director and Zhu Tianlei had longstanding animosity.</p><p>What should he do now? With enemies ahead and tigers behind, did he really end up harming Zhu Tianlei?</p><p>At the same time, he glanced worriedly towards the bed. Feng Xiaoyu's figure was eerily quiet, and from when they left the room to now, Zhu Tianlei hadn't mentioned Feng Xiaoyu at all. If... if Feng Xiaoyu were to die for sure, then both he and Zhu Tianlei would be in deep trouble.</p><p>"Yes, what a coincidence. It seems Director Qiu came prepared today!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei mockingly glanced at the dozens of fully armed police officers following behind Qiu Ran.</p><p>"To deal with a cunning, vicious, and habitual criminal like you, I must be well-prepared to prevent another escape!"</p><p>"From what Director Qiu says, it seems as if he knew the habitual criminal was me even before coming here. This doesn’t seem coincidental, does it, President Qi?"</p><p>Qi Xuehua’s face turned pale, and Qiu Ran realized he had let something slip.</p><p>"Humph, Zhu Tianlei, the law is like a net that catches all, and today I will act on behalf of the people to bring this rogue and habitual killer to justice."</p><p>Saying this, Qiu Ran waved his hand, and the police officers behind him surged forward.</p><p>"Director Qiu, don’t you want to look at the scene? Collect evidence before apprehending someone?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei showed no sign of panic; Qiu Ran did not consider him a threat.</p><p>"Humph, the dead patients in the ward are clear evidence."</p><p>"Oh, with Director Qiu and President Qi being so decisive, I really have nothing to say!"</p><p>Qiu Ran did not expect Zhu Tianlei to react so easily and felt a wave of doubt. However, remembering his father-in-law’s instructions, he gritted his teeth and signaled the police officers to apprehend Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"By the way, I would like to ask Director Qiu, how should police officers be punished if they collude with others to deliberately frame and harm people?"</p><p>Just as a young police officer was about to handcuff Zhu Tianlei, the latter suddenly spoke up.</p><p>"As judicial officials who break the law, they will certainly face severe punishment. However, this has nothing to do with you!"</p><p>"President Song, as medical staff, especially hospital administrators, if one disregards patients’ conditions and even resorts to indiscriminate medication use for their own purposes, worsening their conditions, how should such behavior be punished?"</p><p>Without waiting for Qiu Ran’s reaction, Zhu Tianlei turned to Song Baiyearn and asked sternly.</p><p>Suddenly, Qiu Ran felt a chill down her spine and involuntarily looked at Qi Xuehua. There was an unmistakable hint of panic in Qi Xuehua's eyes.</p><p>But she quickly regained composure. She did it discreetly; nobody would notice. Zhu Tianlei must be desperately struggling, yes, desperately struggling!</p><p>"Expel him and have him examined by the judicial authorities!"</p>

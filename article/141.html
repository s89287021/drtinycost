						<p>"Oh, Huang Journalist has been promoted? Li Journalist, I think you should call Director Huang; otherwise, it might be problematic for you to become a full-fledged journalist after this."</p><p>"Who do you think you are? A quack doctor who killed someone without feeling any remorse, yet still boasts so arrogantly. Why should I listen to you? Director Huang would never recognize someone like you, a medical incompetent!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's threat stirred up Li Xiang's youthful passion, causing her to forget that as a journalist, she should maintain emotional stability and an objective stance.</p><p>"Do you think the same way?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the man behind Li Xiang. He had met this person before and thought he was probably quite familiar with Huang Hai.</p><p>Zhou Zheng looked at Zhu Tianlei, hesitated for a moment, then pulled out his phone.</p><p>"Brother Zhou, what are you doing? We are journalists who must adhere to our principles. How can we be led around by the nose by the parties involved, especially when it comes to a quack doctor who kills people indiscriminately?"</p><p>Seeing Zhou Zheng about to make a call, Li Xiang immediately intervened. Under normal circumstances, she would never argue back in front of her senior, but now, her rationality was completely overwhelmed by her emotions.</p><p>Zhou Zheng looked at Li Xiang without saying anything and dialed the number on his phone.</p><p>Li Xiang's face turned red with anger, but she dared not say anything more. Her eyes were filled with fury, piercing Zhu Tianlei like pins.</p><p>"Li Xiang, Director Huang wants to speak to you..."</p><p>A moment later, Zhou Zheng handed the phone to Li Xiang.</p><p>Li Xiang had previously launched a string of accusations, but she slowly lowered her head in disappointment after hearing something on the other end of the phone from Huang Hai. She reluctantly hung up.</p><p>"Hmph, what are you looking at? Don't think that just because you know Director Huang, you can escape legal punishment or the condemnation of the people. I will report this truthfully and let Director Huang see your true face as a quack doctor."</p><p>Li Xiang was still seething with anger, while Zhu Tianlei remained indifferent. After seeing Zhou Zheng's gaze, he turned around and walked back to the woman.</p><p>Those men shouting slogans were very confident; they had not drunk any water for such a long time, but their voices did not weaken at all. The woman, however, was about to collapse from crying too hard.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei squatted down, glanced at the woman, and placed his hand on her shoulder...</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you are too bold! Are you going to kill someone in broad daylight?"</p><p>The oily man had been eyeing Zhu Tianlei all along. Upon seeing him place his hand on the woman's shoulder, he immediately shouted.</p><p>This scene once again pushed the live broadcast to a minor climax.</p><p>The woman tried to struggle, but stopped when she felt the warmth of Zhu Tianlei's palm.</p><p>A few seconds later.</p><p>"Yes, I did treat the newborn baby. The reason for treatment was that the baby had its airway blocked by meconium and amniotic fluid at birth and nearly suffocated."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the onlookers and faced the cameras head-on, saying solemnly.</p><p>Many people drew a sharp breath.</p><p>The other party had no evidence, and Zhu Tianlei could have completely denied it. Although his reputation might be damaged, he would not have to bear legal consequences. However, Zhu Tianlei actually admitted this in front of everyone.</p><p>Was he crazy?</p><p>Or was he crazy?</p><p>"But..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei paused, and his gaze suddenly turned cold.</p><p>It was unclear whether this change in expression or the natural weather shift caused it.</p><p>The originally clear sky suddenly darkened, with the bright sun obscured by dark clouds. A strong mountain wind howled, causing leaves, bushes, paper money, and banners to rustle noisily.</p><p>The mountain wind stirred up dust, instantly turning into a sandstorm.</p><p>Faced with this sudden change, everyone felt an inexplicable sense of panic in their hearts.</p><p>Dong E's innocence moved heaven and earth, hence the snowfall in June. Could it be that the heavens were advocating for this fragile little life?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood firm in the sandstorm, unmoved, his figure tall and imposing.</p><p>"However, the cause of death for this infant was external force causing internal organs to shatter and organ failure."</p><p>This statement created a huge stir.</p><p>Everyone present was shocked and incredulous at Zhu Tianlei's words.</p><p>How could it be possible? Such a young infant could not have been subjected to such violence. This must be Zhu Tianlei's justification.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, shut your damn mouth! You killed someone and still dare to speak nonsense. Media friends, you all saw it; this is a quack doctor, this is a murderer......"</p><p>The oily man was adept at exploiting opportunities, seizing any chance he could find.</p><p>Zhou Zheng's camera zoomed in several times instantly. Under the lens, the tiny body of the infant was covered with bruises, and the sternum was sunken. Even a fool could see that the infant had indeed suffered horrific torture and abuse.</p><p>The sudden occurrence left the woman momentarily stunned. Upon seeing the injuries on the infant's body, she screamed and then fainted as her vision went black.</p><p>Oily Man also did not expect Zhu Tianlei to suddenly remove the cup from the infant's body and was temporarily disoriented.</p><p>"You... you actually don't even spare the child's corpse; you're worse than an animal, worse than an animal......"</p><p>Feeling that he had to say something, Oily Man could not think of a better excuse due to the urgency of the situation, so he continued to curse.</p><p>"The infant died approximately ten hours ago, around 10:30 PM last night. Three of her ribs were broken, her lungs showed signs of congestion, the right lobe of her liver was fractured, and there was a blood clot about 3.5*2.4cm in size inside her skull. I can take full responsibility for my diagnosis."</p><p>The infant's injuries and Zhu Tianlei's words immediately changed the atmosphere on site.</p><p>Oily Man looked at Zhu Tianlei incredulously, finally forgetting that he should continue his denunciation and defamation.</p><p>Going with the flow is a common trait among most people.</p><p>The reporters covering the event were no exception. The development of events exceeded their expectations, but they also had to admit that such a plot twist would certainly boost ratings.</p><p>"I have contacted the forensic doctor at the nearby police station."</p><p>A reporter with a side part said.</p><p>"I have also contacted the nearest hospital; they will arrange for a specialist doctor to come over soon."</p><p>...</p>

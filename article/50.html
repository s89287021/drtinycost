						<p>Mentioning his son Yao Jianxiong, Yao Gang's face involuntarily twitched.</p><p>In other words, 10,000 five-yuan (purple) banknotes, 1,000 hundred-yuan (red) banknotes, plus a handful of fifty-yuan (green) banknotes, amounting to at least 150,000 yuan.</p><p>Even if he included all his savings, it wouldn't reach 50,000 yuan. Therefore, no matter what Li Xu said before, he had never wavered, but now, his mind was indeed somewhat swayed.</p><p>Thirty thousand yuan could allow his son to choose a bride from nearby villages, and his wife would no longer have to frown all day long.</p><p>"No way, I Yao Gang am elected by the villagers one vote at a time. I must live up to their expectations. Assistant Li, you don't need to say anything more!"</p><p>Li Xu watched as Yao Gang's originally somewhat wavering eyes became resolute once more, his barely calmed anger surging again.</p><p>"Yao Gang, I see you really prefer taking the bitter pill over the sweet one. Do you think you can leave this room safely if you don't sign your name today?"</p><p>Yao Gang's face paled.</p><p>"What... do you mean?"</p><p>No matter how shamelessly Li Xu acted, his attitude toward him was still decent enough; otherwise, he wouldn't have followed him to Yunhai City, just wanting to settle this matter. But upon hearing what Li Xu said earlier, things might not be as simple as he thought.</p><p>"What do I mean? Village Chief Yao, this is the transfer contract. Do you want to sign it yourself or shall I help you?"</p><p>Li Xu took out the pre-prepared transfer contract from his drawer, staring at Yao Gang menacingly.</p><p>"You're committing a crime!"</p><p>Yao Gang instinctively tried to stand up from the sofa; he felt fear, as if Li Xu had transformed into someone else before his eyes.</p><p>"Crime? Haha, Village Chief Yao is really naive. After all these years as village chief, you must have been acting like a fool! The signature and fingerprints on the contract are yours, Village Chief Yao. Such a contract would be valid anywhere!"</p><p>Seeing Li Xu's rampant behavior, Yao Gang became even more anxious.</p><p>"Come on, Village Chief Yao!"</p><p>Li Xu picked up the red ink from the table and handed it along with the contract to Yao Gang's face.</p><p>"I won't sign it!"</p><p>After saying that, Yao Gang suddenly stood up and rushed towards the door.</p><p>But before he could reach the door, it was pushed open from outside. Two burly black-clad men stood outside, wearing sunglasses and looking at Yao Gang gloomily.</p><p>"Village Chief Yao, those who know when to yield are true heroes. Don't make things worse for yourself!"</p><p>"I......"</p><p>Yao Gang looked at Li Xu, then at the security guard by the door, his heart racing with uncertainty.</p><p>He had no idea how things could have come to this point.</p><p>"Come on, help Village Chief Yao!"</p><p>One of the taller security guards walked in, striding right up to Yao Gang. His massive frame resembled half a steel tower.</p><p>Without even saying hello, he grabbed Yao Gang's hand. Li Xu held the ink pad, watching as Yao Gang's fingers touched it, making a shallow indentation on the ink.</p><p>He eagerly handed over the contract. His breathing was ragged; once Yao Gang's finger pressed down, his mission would be accomplished.</p><p>Hurry up, hurry up, Li Xu kept urging himself in his mind.</p><p>"Beep beep beep!"</p><p>Suddenly, a shrill alarm rang out. Li Xu's contract fell to the ground with a thud.</p><p>This was a Level One security alert.</p><p>Since the security department of Shengshi Group had been established, this alarm had never gone off before.</p><p>What had happened?</p><p>The sudden incident revived Yao Gang's already despondent heart, and he forcefully pulled his hand back.</p><p>"Assistant Li, this......"</p><p>The tall security guard was also extremely shocked; he hadn't even noticed when Yao Gang withdrew his hand.</p><p>"Yang Shuang, go check what's happening!"</p><p>Another security guard who had been standing by the door ran away at Li Xu's instruction. However, he reappeared at the door in less than half a minute.</p><p>"What is going on?"</p><p>Li Xu's face was dark as could be; it felt like going out to hook up, taking off his clothes and pants, about to get intimate when suddenly someone interrupted him.</p><p>"L......L......L......."</p><p>"Who are you 'L'ing? I'm asking you!"</p><p>Hearing the stammering security guard, Li Xu became even more irritated. Not a single good thing had happened all day.</p><p>"I don't know what Assistant Li wants to ask."</p><p>A sound came from outside the door. Although Li Xu had only heard it once, he immediately knew who it was.</p><p>Isn't he at Hama Gou?</p><p>How could he be here at Shengshi Group? There are at least ten security guards at the gate of Shengshi Group. How could he walk into the building so nonchalantly?</p><p>But no matter how many doubts Li Xu had in his mind, they couldn’t change the facts before his eyes.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei’s figure slowly appeared at the door and then walked in gradually. The guard at the entrance, Yang Shuang, stared at Zhu Tianlei in disbelief and even forgot to stop him.</p><p>The opponent was too terrifying. As soon as he rushed out, he saw that the opponent had flipped over ten or more security guards with just a few moves. The speed was so fast that he barely had time to see clearly.</p><p>"Tianlei!"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei’s appearance, Yao Gang was almost moved to tears with excitement.</p><p>"What do you want to do?"</p><p>Looking at Zhu Tianlei approaching step by step, Li Xu’s voice trembled. He had witnessed Zhu Tianlei’s strength, and the fact that the security department could activate a level one security alert proved that those guards were no match for Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"What? This question should be directed at Assistant Li. I don’t know why you invited Village Head Yao to Shengshi Group."</p><p>"Tianlei, this Li Xu is trying to force me to sign the contract..."</p><p>At this moment, Yao Gang not only saw Zhu Tianlei as a lifeline but also as a close relative. He desperately wanted to tell his story.</p><p>"You... what are you doing..."</p><p>Before Yao Gang could finish his sentence, he was suddenly grabbed in front by Li Xu. A dagger appeared out of nowhere in Li Xu’s hand.</p><p>The cold glint of the dagger was like frost pricks in winter, instantly turning Yao Gang’s heart into ice.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, if you know what's good for you, get the hell out of here. Otherwise..."</p><p>Li Xu finished speaking, and his dagger was pressed against Yao Gang's neck, his eyes filled with desperate madness.</p><p>"What otherwise? Do you want to kill someone?"</p><p>Although he was incredibly shocked inside, Zhu Tianlei showed no change on his face. Yao Gang, however, felt his legs go weak and his bladder contract in waves.</p>

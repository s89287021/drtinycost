						<p>Pang!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei merely flicked his hand, and the oily man was slapped away with a plop.</p><p>"You dare hit me? You're asking for death..."</p><p>Pang!</p><p>Without even turning his head or being captured by the cameras, Zhu Tianlei flicked the oily man away again, causing him to fall like a dog eating shit.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you stinking turtle brat, scum turtle grandson, animal..."</p><p>The oily man kept spouting dirty words but only lay on the ground, unwilling to get up.</p><p>Several accompanying people glanced at the oily man and then looked at Zhu Tianlei's silhouette. They all chose wisely to be invisible.</p><p>Lesson learned, they weren't stupid!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei instantly stood by the infant girl. The baby wrapped in the blanket had a purple face and black lips. Without needing to touch her, Zhu Tianlei knew that this little infant was dead!</p><p>His heart ached.</p><p>Thinking back to that night, he had been holding this tiny life while joking with Hao Xin about having such an adorable baby in the future. In just a few dozen days, a lively little life was gone like that.</p><p>But he did understand medicine; his Spirit Physician Immortal Techniques were indeed unparalleled worldwide. However, they could not truly bring the dead back to life. The infant had been dead for at least seven or eight hours.</p><p>"My suffering daughter, it's Mommy's fault you're here. Don't reincarnate in Mommy's womb next time, daughter..."</p><p>The woman sobbed uncontrollably, her face pale and bloodless, genuinely emotional.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei placed his hand on the infant girl's chest, and soon his expression turned grim.</p><p>He reached out, preparing to unbutton the small blanket covering the infant. The woman, who had been crying beside him as if she would faint, suddenly lunged at him frantically.</p><p>"Do not touch my daughter, you murderer......"</p><p>"Men, surround her!"</p><p>As the woman lunged, the oily man shouted, and the men who had been standing by without moving quickly surrounded Zhu Tianlei. Each of them held a stick in hand.</p><p>Seeing this scene, all the cameras immediately turned their lenses toward him, like hawks sensing the scent of prey.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned his head slightly, his cold gaze sweeping across the oily man and the other men holding sticks.</p><p>"You say I killed your daughter, is that it?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei suddenly spoke again. The woman, holding her infant, shuddered violently. Her swollen eyes flickered with a look of recognition.</p><p>"Yes, it was you. Since I brought her home, she has been running a high fever. Such a small child, burning so intensely that her body seized up. My daughter had never come into contact with anyone else; could it have been anyone but you?"</p><p>The woman's words were firm. After all, the case involved an infant, and everyone's emotions were highly agitated. Even many of the villagers watching on looked at Zhu Tianlei with some suspicion.</p><p>"What a sin, this child died after just a few weeks......"</p><p>"I heard that this woman had a difficult labor, nearly losing her life giving birth to this child. Now the child has only lived for a few days. Tsk tsk......"</p><p>"Tianlei is going to be in hot water now; you saw it, he even admitted to having saved this child......."</p><p>The villagers' voices rose and fell, though not loudly. Zhu Tianlei could hear them clearly.</p><p>He did not particularly care.</p><p>In the past six months, he had long adapted to this life.</p><p>High mountains wind up, the sea of desire churns, rumors fly, praise and criticism are mixed.</p><p>"Here we come, make way!"</p><p>Before the discussion died down, another loud shout rang out from outside the crowd.</p><p>As the people dispersed, a young man with a small beard and a short guy with a tattoo on his arm and yellow-dyed hair rushed in briskly.</p><p>"Big brother, I brought it!"</p><p>The two men dashed in and waved what they were holding in front of the oily-looking man's face.</p><p>"Hmph, hang it up. If Zhu Tianlei doesn't give us an explanation today, we won't leave!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at them coldly without making any move.</p><p>Several people thought that Zhu Tianlei was frightened by their demeanor and their emotions surged. They pushed Old Liu, who was standing at the door, to one side and then unfolded what they were holding on top of the two stone pillars beside the door with a flap.</p><p>They tied ropes at both ends of the stone pillars, stretching out a white banner about seven or eight meters long.</p><p>"Unscrupulous quack, taking lives lightly, return my daughter, give me justice."</p><p>The white banner with black large letters was shocking to see.</p><p>A group of people stood under the banner, jabbing sticks into the ground and pounding it loudly.</p><p>"Unscrupulous quack, taking lives lightly, return my daughter, give me justice!"</p><p>More than a dozen men shouted in unison, their voices loud, piercing through the morning mist of Toad Hollow and spreading over Great Green Mountain.</p><p>This was Zhu Tianlei's third appearance on television.</p><p>The first time, he appeared as Vice President of Meixin Pharmaceutical Corporation at the Yunhai City Labor Arbitration Center, delivering a powerful and compelling speech that turned what seemed to be an inevitable defeat into a victory. As a result, his name became etched in the records of the Yunhai City Labor Bureau.</p><p>The second time was outside the entrance of Dahua Chain Pharmacy. With just a few words, he exposed a meticulously planned conspiracy. This live broadcast was akin to an exciting crime thriller and set a new record for viewership in Yunhai Minsheng News over the past decade. From then on, Zhu Tianlei's name resonated with all the staff members of Yunhai Minsheng News.</p><p>This time, however, Zhu Tianlei found himself in a more perilous situation. Although there was no evidence, the dead body of the infant, the heartbroken mother who had lost her child, the enraged family members, and Zhu Tianlei's consistent admission of having treated the infant all contributed to his precarious position.</p><p>Under the spotlight and before the live cameras, Zhu Tianlei became the focal point of everyone's intense curiosity.</p><p>Suddenly, a gust of wind swept through, causing a white banner to flutter. The oily man somehow produced a large basket of white paper money, which he tossed into the air. Carried by the mountain breeze, the paper money drifted into the factory area, into the tree groves, and towards the vast Da Qing Mountain.</p><p>Old Liu leaned against the wall, his heart sinking.</p><p>Oh no, Tianlei Medicine is truly finished. He had only been here for two months and hadn't yet enjoyed his current life!</p><p>Just as everyone's expressions varied, Zhu Tianlei suddenly tugged at the corner of his mouth, glancing at a media outlet standing beside him. His eyes swept over the microphone in their hands.</p><p>"Are you a reporter from Yunhai Minsheng Morning News?"</p><p>The other person was a young woman who looked startled upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's question.</p><p>"Yes, I'm intern reporter Li Xiang."</p><p>"Oh, Ms. Li, could you please try to contact Huang Hai, the reporter?"</p><p>Li Xiang frowned.</p><p>"Can we just find our director whenever you want?"</p><p>For Li Xiang, Huang Hai is her idol, the pioneer of the industry, and the person she has always dreamed of becoming. In contrast, she does not have any positive feelings towards Zhu Tianlei in front of her.</p>

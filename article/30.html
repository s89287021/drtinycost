						<p>Wu Pingjian did not respond to Zhao Jianguo's provocation but instead turned to look at Zhu Tianlei, his tone familiar. Sun Jianguo, Zhang Gu, Zhao Zhiguo, Sun Jiang, and others' hearts sank at this moment. They never imagined that Zhu Tianlei would actually know Mayor Wu. So, was the call just made to Mayor Wu? "Mayor Wu, the matter is simple. My friend and I came for dinner, but when it was time to pay, we were blocked at the door by someone who attacked us without any reason. As a man, I could have ignored it, but he even went after the women. I did act, but not with the intention of harming him; rather, I protected and saved people." Facing Wu Pingjian's inquiry, Zhu Tianlei showed no fear or hesitation, speaking clearly and succinctly. "Mayor Wu, this kid is lying. He was clearly provoking us first. The injured party acted in self-defense, yet unexpectedly, this kid, despite his skills, ended up seriously injuring the other person. This can be attested to by the hotel manager." Seeing Sun Jianguo's expression, Qiu Ran formulated some words in her mind and approached Wu Pingjian. "Who are you?" Wu Pingjian looked at Qiu Ran, not looking too pleased. He was already overwhelmed with this situation and desperately wanted it resolved quickly, but Qiu Ran clearly intended to stir things up further. "I am Captain Qiu Ran of the Criminal Investigation Division of Suzhou District." Qiu Ran felt a hint of excitement. If not for Sun Jiang's incident today, as the head of a district criminal investigation team, he would never have had the chance to meet the mayor of the city, especially Wu Pingjian, who was in charge of governance and law. "Where is the hotel manager?" As soon as Wu Pingjian finished speaking, a somewhat plump middle-aged man stepped out from the crowd, his eyes briefly flickering with panic. "Mayor Wu, I am He Ping, the manager of Linyuan Chun." "Manager He, since you witnessed the entire incident, please share your account!"</p><p>He Ping took a deep breath. He had been personally promoted by Sun JianGuo, so he had always been loyal to him. However, facing the number one and two leaders of Yunhai City at this moment, it was impossible for him not to feel nervous.</p><p>"Captain Qiu is right; this guest came to our restaurant for dinner and believed we were overcharging and cheating during the payment process, even insulting our staff. Mr. Sun is a shareholder of the hotel and happened to be inspecting the store today, so he went into the private room to find out what was happening. Unexpectedly, not only did they refuse to listen, but they also attacked Mr. Sun severely."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled at He Ping, who was recounting the story in great detail, wondering what he was thinking.</p><p>However, Hao Xinmei's face changed drastically. A wave of anger surged up from her heart and suddenly erupted.</p><p>"Manager He, you are twisting facts and spreading lies. It was clearly Sun Jiang who initiated the attack."</p><p>Hao Xinmei often dined at Liyuan Chun and wasn't unfamiliar with He Ping. When this incident hadn't occurred, He Ping had been charming and flexible, excelling in both his work and personal interactions. Hao Xinmei even admired him.</p><p>But now, Hao Xinmei wished she could slap him.</p><p>"Xiaolin, you were serving the guest in the private room. Do you think what I said is true?"</p><p>The young waiter with twinkling eyes, having been frightened by a series of events earlier, was already somewhat stunned. Hearing He Ping's question, he almost instinctively nodded repeatedly.</p><p>"Yes, yes, Manager is telling the truth!"</p><p>"Little girl, tell me the truth! If not for his protection, you might have been beaten up by those people together just now. Now, you're saying such things, where is your conscience?"</p><p>Hao Xinmei didn't expect the young waiter to side with He Ping as well and felt both angry and cold.</p><p>Wu Pingjian's head was buzzing. If it were only about rescuing someone from jail, he would have simply informed Zhang Gu. But now, in broad daylight, he couldn't use his position as mayor to intimidate people, especially since Secretary Yang was right there.</p><p>"Mayor Wu, I have something for you to see!"</p><p>Just when Wu Pingjian's mind was agitated and his temper flaring up, Zhu Tianlei, who had remained silent for a while, suddenly spoke again.</p><p>Wu Pingjian glanced at Zhu Tianlei, who appeared calm and even seemed somewhat indifferent. His agitation inexplicably dissipated.</p><p>"Oh? Boy, if this matter is really as the manager said, I would still handle it impartially."</p><p>"That's natural. Tian Lei has always been brave and decisive. However, if I didn't do it, you absolutely cannot splash dirty water on me. Mayor Wu will see through everything once he sees this!"</p><p>Everyone's gaze fell on Zhu Tian Lei simultaneously. They saw Zhu Tian Lei holding his phone and tapping lightly; a voice then came from the phone.</p><p>This was Sun Jiang's voice.</p><p>Hao Xinmei first opened her mouth in shock, then shook her head with a smile. Zhu Tian Lei's brain really was exceptionally smart; it turned out he wasn't just pretending not to know how to use a phone. Now it seemed that not only could he use one, but he did so very skillfully!</p><p>Hearing the voice from the phone, Sun Jianguo's face paled gradually.</p><p>He originally thought the other party was merely a strong rural man with no brains in his head, and that he could easily make him worse off by just moving his fingers. However, he never expected the other party to be not only exceptionally smart but also to have a powerful background.</p><p>The recording from the phone had already made Sun Jianguo realize that today's matter would not only result in Sun Jiang losing his leg; it was likely that he himself would be implicated as well. Thinking of this, his gaze at Zhu Tian Lei and Hao Xinmei became even more filled with resentment.</p><p>Sun Jiang, lying on the stretcher, was thoroughly stunned, almost forgetting to wail in agony. Why did things turn out completely different from what he had imagined? He was the young master of the Sun family, and his father was the chairman of Sun Pharmaceutical Group!</p><p>Wu Pingjian listened to the recording from the phone and a faint smile slowly appeared in his eyes.</p><p>Someone who could receive such high praise from an elder like Master Ma was indeed no ordinary person!</p><p>"Director Zhang, how do you think this matter should be handled?"</p><p>Zhang Gu's forehead was covered with a dense layer of sweat. What a reversal of fortune in the gutter!</p><p>"It was my failure to investigate thoroughly and dereliction of duty. Since this young man acted in self-defense, this is clearly a misunderstanding!"</p><p>"Director Zhang, your statement seems too casual and carefree. If Tian Lei hadn't recorded it, he would likely have been arrested by you guys already. A misunderstanding? It's clear that you're all colluding to want to put Zhu Tian Lei to death!"</p><p>Hearing Zhang Gu casually brush off the matter with just two words, "misunderstanding," Hao Xinmei could no longer control her anger and roared. </p><p>Zhang Gu felt somewhat embarrassed by Hao Xinmei's words but found it hard to refute her; his expression was a mix of feelings, quite a spectacle.</p><p>"Yes, Director Zhang is right, it's just a misunderstanding, haha!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei glared disapprovingly at Zhu Tianlei. Now that the truth was on their side, they should take advantage of this opportunity instead of being foolish?</p><p>"Young man, I really didn't misjudge you!"</p>

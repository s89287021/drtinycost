						<p>"Bro, it's this guy showing off!"</p><p>A voice with a sharp, monkey-like tone.</p><p>"Who dares touch my men? You've grown too fat and soft!"</p><p>That voice sounded familiar!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei lifted his head. When he saw the person speaking in front of him, he couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p><p>The world is so small; we parted yesterday, and today we meet again.</p><p>"Lu Big Boss, you're doing well!"</p><p>Lu Kang's body stiffened involuntarily, trembling slightly.</p><p>He took a step forward and finally saw who was standing in front of him.</p><p>Damn!</p><p>Lu Kang cursed the heavens several times inwardly.</p><p>"Haha, I never expected it to be little brother you. What a stroke of fate! Jinyan, quickly apologize to this little brother. You're all comrades!"</p><p>Lu Kang laughed nervously; these people were his subordinates. If they found out about last night's incident when Zhu Tianlei had taken a beating, how could he face the streets anymore!</p><p>But he dared not confront Zhu Tianlei again, so he could only hope that Zhu Tianlei would also want to avoid trouble.</p><p>"Brother, it's no misunderstanding; this fool hid that stinking woman. I wanted to search for her, and this guy beat up our comrades. This isn't a misunderstanding; this fool doesn't care about his brothers or us! That's hitting your face, Brother!"</p><p>Jinyan, not understanding the reason, immediately got angry upon hearing Lu Kang say this!</p><p>"Shut up! Apologize if I tell you to!"</p><p>Lu Anti's anger boiled over. Jin Ya usually seemed quite clever, but why was he being so obtuse at this critical moment!</p><p>"I won't apologize, Big Brother. Everything Jin Ya said is the truth. I don't agree with what Big Brother did!"</p><p>Jin Ya stubbornly held his ground, refusing to admit fault.</p><p>Lu Anti's anger flared up even more.</p><p>"Slap!"</p><p>A resounding slap landed on Jin Ya's face, causing half of it to immediately swell up. Jin Ya looked at Lu Anti in disbelief.</p><p>"Apologize, or don't blame me if I don't recognize you as a brother anymore!"</p><p>Seeing this scene unfold before them, everyone was stunned. Jin Ya was Big Brother's favorite; not only had he never been slapped before, but Big Brother usually pampered him excessively, to the point where Jin Ya could do as he pleased without any reservations.</p><p>"Big Brother... you hit me?"</p><p>"Apologize!"</p><p>Lu Anti's face darkened to an even deeper shade.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, on the other hand, remained motionless, seemingly enjoying the commotion before him.</p><p>"Brother, it was my mistake. I was short-sighted not to recognize true talent. Brother, don't hold me in low regard!"</p><p>After a long hesitation, Jin Ya finally opened his mouth and apologized. He understood that a small loss could prevent bigger problems.</p><p>"Yes, Brother, there really was a misunderstanding today. Why don't you let it go? Or how about I treat you to some fun at Jinhantidi?"</p><p>Lu Kang blushed, acknowledging his inferior skill and accepting defeat.</p><p>"Forget it! Lu Kang, what you do is under the watch of heaven. Always stay cautious when walking by the riverside; I hope we don't have another chance to meet!"</p><p>After watching the commotion, Zhu Tianlei casually tossed out this remark, causing Lu Kang's face to pale, but he didn't dare to disagree.</p><p>"Yes yes yes, Brother says so!"</p><p>Including Golden Teeth and several other Black Eagle Gang brothers were quite puzzled. The person who was nodding submissively and fawning before them was their big brother?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei finished speaking without another word, opened the car door, and got in.</p><p>In the driver's seat, Hao Xinmei gave Zhu Tianlei a thumbs up and then stepped on the accelerator, sending the car roaring away.</p><p>This left several bewildered Black Eagle Gang henchmen looking at each other.</p><p>Hao Xinmei drove directly to the hotel where Zhu Tianlei was staying. Yao Gang had already left, but he had left a note for Zhu Tianlei at the front desk.</p><p>"Alright, now I'm all alone!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei waved the note in front of Hao Xinmei's face with a pitiful look.</p><p>"Don't think you know what plans are in my mind; it won't work!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei approached meekly.</p><p>"What plans are in your mind?"</p><p>"You... hmph!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei blushed again. Zhu Tianlei was completely different when saving lives compared to his usual self.</p><p>"Haha, just kidding! You really got angry, huh? I'll stay at the hotel for one more night and leave early tomorrow. It's been a few days since I came out!"</p><p>Seeing Hao Xinmei's rosy red face, Zhu Tianlei grinned several times. He loved seeing the woman in front of him pouting with a huff.</p><p>"I'll come pick you up tomorrow morning!"</p><p>Watching Hao Xinmei leave, Zhu Tianlei indulged in his fantasies again before returning to his room.</p><p>Since he had slept for a long time during the day, he wasn't very tired at that moment. Therefore, he plugged in his phone charger and sat on the bed, closing his eyes to meditate calmly.</p><p>The ball of spiritual energy in his dantian was now as full as a fist and could change size according to how much spiritual energy he used.</p><p>Every time he used spiritual energy to treat someone, it seemed to deplete first but then doubled the depleted amount, becoming even more stable and pure.</p><p>For instance, within half an hour of absorbing it, his meridians and qi flow were incredibly smooth.</p><p>An hour later, Zhu Tianlei ended his meditation without any fatigue; instead, he felt refreshed and clear-minded. His gaze was sharp as a lightning bolt, piercing through the window to view the city of Yunhai's myriad lights and colorful neon signs.</p><p>After taking a quick shower, Zhu Tianlei turned on the TV and pulled out his phone, which had already charged to eighty percent.</p><p>As soon as he turned it on, the phone vibrated incessantly, startling him.</p><p>There were seventeen missed calls, over sixty WeChat messages, and two promotional text messages.</p><p>Lying in bed, Zhu Tianlei first glanced at the missed calls. Among them were several from Hao Xinmei, Min Shengjun, Ma Lanlan, and Yao Gang, but there was also an unknown number with four missed calls.</p><p>After some thought, Zhu Tianlei pressed the redial button.</p><p>"Hello, who is this?"</p><p>.......</p><p>The phone rang, but there was no sound on the other end. However, Zhu Tianlei knew that someone was on the line.</p><p>"Hello? Speak up! Who are you?"</p><p>......</p><p>Zhu Tianlei repeated himself several times, but still received no response from the other end of the line, which made him increasingly frustrated.</p><p>What a mystery!</p><p>He browsed through WeChat and his Moments, then checked a few articles about herb procurement and cultivation. Soon, he felt drowsy and fell asleep in nothing but his underwear.</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei heard someone knocking on the door and groggily got up to answer it. Just as he opened the door, he heard a piercing scream that nearly burst his eardrums.</p><p>Standing at the doorstep was Hao Xinmei, holding a paper bag of KFC breakfast. Her face was flushed red, and she stared wide-eyed at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"You... you... pervert!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei lowered his head and then realized he was shirtless, wearing only tight briefs. Since it was early morning, he hadn't used the bathroom yet, and there was a spectacular sight in that area of his briefs.</p><p>"Hehe, my buddy gets easily excited when he sees beautiful ladies!"</p>

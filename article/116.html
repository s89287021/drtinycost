						<p>The Administrative Inspection Department is a specialized agency that collaborates with administrative departments and the Labor Bureau to conduct investigations and gather evidence, subordinate to the Public Security System.</p><p>"Alright, since this is the case, Sun Mou will certainly cooperate!" </p><p>Sun Jianguo clenched his fists until they turned pale, devoid of any color.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>The Labor Arbitration Hall was bustling with activity.</p><p>This was undoubtedly a major news story.</p><p>Ordinarily, labor arbitrations were usually represented by the company's legal department or human resources department, but for the legal representatives of two large pharmaceutical companies to appear in court directly was simply too hard to ignore.</p><p>All kinds of newspapers, television stations, and other media outlets surrounded the entire arbitration hall, filling it to capacity; it could be said that they all came out in force.</p><p>On the podium, Hao Xinhui wore a sleek black professional suit that accentuated her graceful figure even more. Her light makeup gave her an air of mystery without smiling.</p><p>On the other side, Sun Jianguo was dressed in a business suit. Although he sat upright, his face betrayed signs of fatigue, with dark circles under his eyes and a fierce glare directed at Hao Xinhui sitting opposite him and Zhu Tianlei behind her, wishing he could see through them right away.</p><p>"Quiet, the court is now about to begin. Please have both plaintiffs and defendants take their seats."</p><p>The presiding judge was a young female staff member, with six jurors in attendance, making it quite an extensive panel.</p><p>Following the usual procedure, the plaintiff would first present their claims, then provide evidence, after which the defendant would counter-argue and present their own evidence, before the court made its verdict or set a date for a later announcement.</p><p>As the plaintiff representing Meixin Pharmaceutical, Chen Guangming spoke first. His statement was rather ordinary, and Zhu Tianlei listened with a smile on his face, seemingly delighted, while Sun Jianguo's expression darkened to an extreme degree.</p><p>He wanted Zhu Tianlei dead!</p><p>Mingxin Pharmaceutical's spokesperson, who happened to be a legal advisor, said nothing extraordinary; in short, there was no persuasiveness whatsoever. Sun Jianguo's expression finally eased slightly. He had thought that Zhu Tianlei and Hao Xinmei had some capabilities, but it seemed they were just bluffing.</p><p>"Where are the plaintiffs?"</p><p>The judge inquired.</p><p>A hint of smugness flashed across Sun Jianguo's eyes.</p><p>With no plaintiffs present, there was no way to proceed with the trial. On the other hand, Mingxin Pharmaceutical had abundant evidence. With so many media present, Mingxin Pharmaceutical's reputation would inevitably be severely damaged; even if they escaped unscathed, they would be humiliated.</p><p>"The plaintiffs have withdrawn their lawsuit!"</p><p>Another staff member walked in from outside and announced to everyone.</p><p>Withdrawn their lawsuit?</p><p>Instantly, the courtroom erupted into chaos. To withdraw a lawsuit just before the trial began was awfully suspicious, wasn't it?</p><p>Sun Jianguo twitched the corner of his mouth; money could make devils do anything, and Sun Jianguo happened to be flush with cash.</p><p>Tu Feng's entire family depended on him for support, and 300,000 yuan would be enough to ensure that everyone kept their mouths shut.</p><p>"Given this situation, today's arbitration seems to belong solely to Mingxin Pharmaceutical. It's truly a pity!"</p><p>Sun Jianguo looked at Hao Xinmei, his lips curling into a sardonic smile as he said ambiguously.</p><p>"Since the plaintiffs have withdrawn their lawsuit, Sunshi Pharmaceutical may leave the courtroom."</p><p>The judge glanced at Sun Jianguo and stated.</p><p>"Mr. Sun's words are truly inspiring and motivating!" </p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood up, clapping several times. Instantly, all media attention was drawn to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Sun Jianguo's expression darkened.</p><p>"Who are you? To my knowledge, you do not appear to be an employee of Meixing Pharmaceutical nor its hired agent; it is not your place to speak."</p><p>Hearing Sun Jianguo's words, the room erupted in whispers. This was a courtroom, not a marketplace, and Sun Jianguo had clearly put Zhu Tianlei on the spot.</p><p>"He is Meixing Pharmaceutical's newly appointed vice president, responsible for all of Meixing Pharmaceutical's external business!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei's voice fell, precise and deliberate.</p><p>Sun Jianguo's expression turned grim but he could say no more. Nevertheless, he knew that regardless of Zhu Tianlei's capabilities, the situation was beyond redemption for Meixing Pharmaceutical.</p><p>"Honorable court officials, I, Zhu Tianlei, accept a full power of attorney from Ms. Hao Xinmei, chairman of Meixing Pharmaceutical, to represent Meixing Pharmaceutical in this labor dispute case. For the lawsuit filed by Meixing Pharmaceutical employee Chen Guangming, we present the following evidence."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei straightened his posture, picked up a document from the table, and it was immediately taken away and placed before the court officials.</p><p>Sun Jianguo's heart skipped a beat.</p><p>The court officials and a few others whispered among themselves for a moment, then nodded at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>In the audience section, several figures slowly stood up.</p><p>Sun Jianguo's heart froze at this moment.</p><p>The first was Tu Feng, who took 300,000 yuan from Sun Jianguo to agree to drop the lawsuit. The second was Zhang Qiang, who suddenly fainted on the construction site of Tianlei Pharmaceutical. The third was Han Lin, the HR manager of Sun Pharmaceutical Industry.</p><p>"My name is Tu Feng. I did not sit in the plaintiff's seat because Chairman Sun Jianguo gave my mother a check for 300,000 yuan to convince me to drop the lawsuit."</p><p>"My name is Zhang Qiang, and I am a worker from the construction unit that built Tianlei Pharmaceutical. I am here to testify that Chairman Sun Jianguo of Sun Pharmaceutical Industry bribed me to frame the chairman of Tianlei Pharmaceutical—that is, Zhu Tianlei, the vice-chairman of Meixin Pharmaceutical."</p><p>"My name is Han Lin, the HR manager of Sun Pharmaceutical Industry. I want to testify that Sun Jianguo violated labor principles by extending employees' working hours without limit and failing to pay corresponding compensation as stipulated in relevant documents. He also coldly treated employees who fell ill due to overwork."</p><p>...</p><p>Sun Jianguo's hands were cold.</p><p>How could things have turned out like this?</p><p>"You are slandering me, brazenly slandering me. I, Sun Jianguo, founded Sun Pharmaceutical Industry at the age of twenty and have always been law-abiding for decades. I absolutely did nothing wrong. Who instructed you? What is your motive?"</p>

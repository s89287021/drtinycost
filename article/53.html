						<p>Zhu Tianlei felt his heart racing as he stared at the simple numbers on the screen, having checked them over a dozen times but still unable to believe what his eyes were seeing.</p><p>One hundred thousand?</p><p>He, Zhu Tianlei, never in his wildest dreams imagined owning such a sum of money.</p><p>What did one hundred thousand mean?</p><p>Slipping back his bank card, Zhu Tianlei wobbled as he continued aimlessly down the street, his mind struggling to come to terms with it all.</p><p>Yunhai City at night, though not comparable to its bustling daytime scene, was still more lively than the isolated Hamagou valley.</p><p>Tens of thousands of lights illuminated the streets, vehicles moving in a steady stream.</p><p>Fragrances from street food wafted over, enhanced by the night breeze, making one's mouth water involuntarily.</p><p>Despite having eaten quite a bit during dinner, these scents still stirred some passion within Zhu Tianlei. Fortunately, he spotted a small stall at the corner with its lights on and steam rising.</p><p>"Boy, how about a bowl of tripe soup? Old hands, very tasty..."</p><p>The owner of the small stall was an elderly woman with wrinkles all over her face; her accent suggested she was not from around here.</p><p>"How's it taste? Can't be bad, right?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei finish his bowl of tripe in large gulps, the old lady seemed delighted, laughing and asking him.</p><p>"Delicious. Your mother's cooking is top-notch."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei wasn't exaggerating; the tripe was genuinely flavorful, with no hint of gamey taste at all, leaving a lingering pleasantness in his mouth.</p><p>"Ai, ai, boy, you shouldn't spend so much money like this."</p><p>Now, I will pass this to the senior proofreading editor for further refinement.</p><p>The old woman saw the one hundred dollars that Zhu Tianlei had placed on the table and chased after him, shouting. Zhu Tianlei smiled and quickly walked to the bottom of the overpass, waving at the old woman. This bowl of beef tripe was worth it. With a full belly, it was time to check his money. Zhu Tianlei took out his phone and checked the time: 11:20 PM; it was about time to go back. However, just then, his phone rang. "Help me!" It was an unknown number, and it was an SMS message. Who would still send text messages nowadays? "Who are you?" Zhu Tianlei replied. "Help me!" What a sick joke? Zhu Tianlei glanced at the content of the message, pursed his lips, and thought that people these days were really bored. Sending him a message in the middle of the night to treat him as their Sunday amusement! "Help me, Qingchuan Factory..." ... "Help me, please!" ... "Help me, good Samaritan!"</p><p>The old woman chased after Zhu Tianlei when she saw the one hundred dollars he had placed on the table and shouted at him. Zhu Tianlei smiled and quickly made his way to the bottom of the overpass, waving goodbye to her. This bowl of beef tripe was definitely worth it. With a full stomach, it was time to check his wallet. Zhu Tianlei took out his phone, glanced at the time, 11:20 PM, and decided it was about time to go back home. Just then, his phone rang. "Help me!" It was an unknown number, and it was an SMS message. Who still sent text messages these days? "Who are you?" Zhu Tianlei replied curtly. "Help me!" He rolled his eyes at the text. What kind of person would send such a message in the middle of the night just to bother him? "Help me! Qingchuan Factory..." ... "Help me, please!" ... "Help me, kind soul!"</p><p>The old woman spotted Zhu Tianlei placing one hundred dollars on the table and chased after him, shouting frantically. Zhu Tianlei smiled and hurried to the bottom of the overpass, waving a farewell. This bowl of beef tripe was indeed worth it. With his belly full, he checked his wallet. Zhu Tianlei pulled out his phone and glanced at the time—11:20 PM—and realized it was almost time to head back home. Suddenly, his phone rang. "Help me!" The caller ID showed an unfamiliar number, and the message was sent via SMS. It was surprising that anyone still used text messages these days. "Who are you?" Zhu Tianlei replied tersely. "Help me!" He shook his head in disbelief at the message. What kind of person would send such a message in the middle of the night? "Help me, Qingchuan Factory..." ... "Help me, please!" ... "Help me, kind soul!"</p><p>In just a few minutes, Zhu Tianlei's phone buzzed constantly. The messages were all short, and they conveyed almost the same meaning: help!</p><p>Could it really be true?</p><p>"What happened to you?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei replied.</p><p>"I was......."</p><p>A clearly unfinished message came through, after which the phone fell silent.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei waited for over ten minutes, but his phone did not ring again. Just then, a gust of night wind blew by, and Zhu Tianlei couldn't help shivering.</p><p>After some thought, he dialed the number.</p><p>"Sorry, the phone you are trying to reach is out of service. Please try again later!"</p><p>Out of service?</p><p>An ominous feeling rose in Zhu Tianlei's heart. He hesitated for a moment before reaching out to stop an approaching taxi.</p><p>"Driver, Qingchuan Factory!"</p><p>"Qingchuan Factory? Buddy, what are you going there for this late at night?"</p><p>The driver's face turned somewhat strange upon hearing that Zhu Tianlei was headed to Qingchuan Factory.</p><p>"It's urgent, Driver. Hurry up, please!"</p><p>If the person who sent the text wasn't pranking him, then they were probably in real danger, and the situation was very critical.</p><p>"Brother, it's not that I won't go; the place is just too remote. There isn't even a streetlight. I..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei fished in his pocket and pulled out a hundred-yuan bill, throwing it directly onto the taxi driver's dashboard.</p><p>"Alright, I'll take my chances!"</p><p>Seeing the money, the driver gritted his teeth, stepped on the gas, and the car shot off.</p><p>Sure enough, the road got more winding as they drove deeper into darkness. Soon, everything was pitch-black, with tall grasses swaying in the night wind, creating an eerie scene.</p><p>In Yunhai City, to find such a desolate place was beyond Zhu Tianlei's expectations. Yet, precisely because of this, he became even more convinced that the person who sent him the text message was indeed in danger.</p><p>About seven or eight minutes later, the taxi stopped.</p><p>"Brother, we're here!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced outside; it was still pitch-black, with only the car's headlights illuminating a small patch ahead. However, there was no warmth to the light amidst the darkness of night.</p><p>"Wait for me for ten minutes at most twenty. If I haven't come back by then, leave without me!"</p><p>With that said, Zhu Tianlei pulled out another hundred-yuan bill from his pocket and tossed it onto the passenger seat before slamming the car door shut.</p><p>The driver glanced at Zhu Tianlei and then at the one-hundred-yuan note on the dashboard. After some internal struggle, he gritted his teeth and put the money in his pocket.</p><p>In front of him, the Qingchuan Factory resembled a sleeping giant, quietly resting in the night.</p><p>This was an abandoned factory. Judging from the scattered large machinery, it must have been a production plant. The courtyard was vast, overgrown with wild grass. A sign over two meters long lay at the gate, and on the wall beside it, there were still remnants of the slogan 'Work happily, return safely.'</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Zhu Tianlei took a step towards the factory.</p><p>Inside the factory, dust was everywhere. With every breath, he inhaled the particles, which irritated his throat and made him cough.</p><p>Inside the factory, there were only abandoned machines, along with silicone gloves and greasy work clothes scattered everywhere, as well as broken chairs. </p><p>The floor was also covered in oil stains; despite the passage of time, the smell of motor oil remained distinctly perceptible.</p><p>The factory was eerily silent. Although Zhu Tianlei's footsteps were light, his sounds echoed through the empty space.</p><p>Suddenly, a dark shadow darted out from behind a machine, fleeting like a gust of wind.</p><p>"Meow!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei calmed himself; it was just an owl.</p><p>Time passed slowly, and Zhu Tianlei had already checked every corner of the factory without finding any anomalies.</p><p>In this vast factory, apart from himself, there seemed to be no other signs of life. The night breeze rustled through the weeds in the courtyard, adding a touch of eeriness to the darkness.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned.</p><p>Could it really just be a prank?</p><p>No, that couldn't be right. The content of the text message was still vividly clear in his mind. He picked up his phone, intending to redial as before, but just as he reached for it, a soft thudding sound suddenly came from behind him.</p><p>"Bang bang bang!"</p><p>This sound, like an incantation, echoed through the silent night.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned around and saw a pool of blood slowly seeping out from beneath a machine, resembling a red serpent slowly winding its way forward.</p><p>The clouds parted, allowing moonlight to pour in, illuminating the glaring pool of blood.</p><p>......</p>

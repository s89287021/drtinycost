						<p>At night, Zhu Tianlei went to bed early. He had already planned to get up very early the next day to take a closer look at the situation in Xiaohexi's medicinal field.</p><p>Now that he had money, setting up a pharmaceutical factory could be put on his schedule.</p><p>"Yang Xiaoxue, I love you. Marry me, I promise to treat you well, Xiaoxue......"</p><p>In the middle of the night, Zhu Tianlei was suddenly woken up by a ringing phone. He groggily picked up the call and hadn't even opened his mouth when he heard a man's voice on the other end.</p><p>A man?</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shot out of bed immediately.</p><p>"Xu Mingzhe, let me go! I've already told you many times that it's impossible!"</p><p>"Xiaoxue, I love you. I want you......"</p><p>"Ahhh!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue's scream instantly darkened Zhu Tianlei's face. He rushed out of the house without even putting on clothes, wearing only his vest and underwear, like a gust of wind heading towards Yang Xiaoxue's residence.</p><p>"Bang!"</p><p>The gate to Yang Xiaoxue's courtyard was kicked open by someone seven minutes later. Then, Zhu Tianlei, like a strong wind, charged into the house in an instant.</p><p>Xu Mingzhe was pinning Yang Xiaoxue down, his hands pressing on her wrists as he tried desperately to kiss her mouth.</p><p>"F*ck you!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was burning with rage; daring to touch his woman was sheer suicide!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei almost acted on instinct, grabbing Xu Mingzhe by the collar and slinging him against the wall like a sandbag with a loud thud.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue hadn't expected Zhu Tianlei to arrive so quickly. Her heart, already in despair, suddenly revived upon seeing Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Tiandelei!"</p><p>All her grievances and fears turned into two words that spilled out of her mouth, followed by Yang Xiaoxue crying as she threw herself into Zhu Tianlei's arms.</p><p>Seeing Yang Xiaoxue's face pale from shock, tears streaming down her cheeks, Zhu Tianlei's heart, full of pain, shattered into pieces.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Xu Mingzhe was slammed against the wall, his back colliding painfully. But compared to the pain, the scene before him was even more shocking.</p><p>He knew Yang Xiaoxue intimately and that she had no boyfriend. Yet now, Yang Xiaoxue was sprawled in Zhu Tianlei's arms, her manner clearly very intimate.</p><p>"Who are you? The one who hit you!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said this and then placed Yang Xiaoxue aside, delivering a kick to Xu Mingzhe's chest. Xu Mingzhe felt a searing pain in his chest as blood churned, and he coughed up fresh blood.</p><p>"Dare to hit me? Do you know who I am?"</p><p>Xu Mingzhe hadn't expected Zhu Tianlei to be so ruthless and couldn't help feeling slightly intimidated, though secretly reached for his pocket.</p><p>"I don't care who you are. Touching my woman means looking for death!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei prepared to strike again but was stopped by Yang Xiaoxue.</p><p>"Tiandelei, stop. I'm fine."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face darkened. Just thinking about Xu Mingzhe on top of Yang Xiaoxue set a raging fire in his heart that burned away all his reason.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei almost acted without thinking, grabbing Xu Mingzhe by the collar and slinging him against the wall like a sandbag with a loud thud.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue hadn't expected Zhu Tianlei to arrive so quickly. Her heart, already in despair, suddenly revived upon seeing Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Tiandelei!"</p><p>All her grievances and fears turned into two words that spilled out of her mouth, followed by Yang Xiaoxue crying as she threw herself into Zhu Tianlei's arms.</p><p>Seeing Yang Xiaoxue's face pale from shock, tears streaming down her cheeks, Zhu Tianlei's heart, full of pain, shattered into pieces.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Xu Mingzhe was slammed against the wall, his back colliding painfully. But compared to the pain, the scene before him was even more shocking.</p><p>He knew Yang Xiaoxue intimately and that she had no boyfriend.

Just thinking about Xu Mingzhe on top of Yang Xiaoxue set a raging fire in his heart that burned away all his reason.</p><p>Almost without hesitation, Zhu Tianlei grabbed Xu Mingzhe by the collar and hurled him against the wall with a loud thud, as if he were a sandbag.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue had not anticipated Zhu Tianlei's swift arrival. Her heart, already in despair, suddenly revived upon seeing him.</p><p>"Tiandelei!"</p><p>All her grievances and fears erupted into two words that spilled from her lips, followed by Yang Xiaoxue weeping as she threw herself into Zhu Tianlei's arms.</p><p>Seeing Yang Xiaoxue's face pale with shock, tears streaming down her cheeks, Zhu Tianlei's heart, filled with pain, shattered into pieces.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Xu Mingzhe was slammed against the wall, his back colliding painfully.

Touching my woman means looking for death!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei prepared to strike again but was stopped by Yang Xiaoxue.</p><p>"Tiandelei, stop. I'm fine."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face darkened. Just thinking about Xu Mingzhe on top of Yang Xiaoxue set a raging fire in his heart that burned away all his reason.</p><p>Tian Lei, it's better to avoid unnecessary trouble. He is County Mayor Yang's nephew!"</p><p>Seeing that Zhu Tianlei did not nod, Yang Xiaoxue lowered her voice and whispered in his ear.</p><p>"Are you County Mayor Yang's nephew?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei raised an eyebrow, asking sternly with a dark look in his eyes, unreadable for joy or anger.</p><p>"Hmph, do you know fear now? I tell you, if you act wisely, hurry up and kneel to apologize. I can still say a few good words for you in front of my uncle, otherwise..."</p><p>"Otherwise what?"</p><p>"Otherwise, I'll move your head!"</p><p>Xu Mingzhe felt that his words were very impressive and secretly delighted. Although his uncle was just a county mayor, he had extensive connections everywhere, making his power far surpassing an ordinary county mayor.</p><p>"That all depends on whether you have the chance or not!"</p><p>"You...you...you...what are you going to do?"</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei approached him step by step, Xu Mingzhe seemed to smell the scent of death.</p><p>"Let you know what happens to anyone who touches my Zhu Tianlei's woman!"</p><p>With that said, a silver needle flashed in Zhu Tianlei's hand and instantly pierced into Xu Mingzhe's neck.</p><p>A silver needle could be used to save or kill, depending entirely on one's intent.</p><p>Xu Mingzhe only felt a sharp pain in his lower abdomen, followed by excruciating pain throughout his groin area, as if thousands of ants were biting his treasure.</p><p>"You go back and tell County Magistrate Yang, I will not change my name or surname, Zhu Tianlei of Hamagou. If he wants to take up your case, come find me!" </p><p>Xu Mingzhe reached out to cover his treasure, his face as pale as paper.</p><p>"What have you done to me?"</p><p>Xu Mingzhe was no fool; he knew that the pain he was experiencing now must be due to the silver needle Zhu Tianlei had just used.</p><p>"Cutting off descendants!"</p><p>What?</p><p>Xu Mingzhe's heart jolted. His family had been an only son for four generations, and he was their only hope to continue the lineage and carry on the Xu family name!</p><p>"You...Zhu Tianlei, I will make you pay for this! And you, Yang Xiaoxue, you will be mine, Xu Mingzhe's, sooner or later!"</p><p>The words "cutting off descendants" were like arsenic to Xu Mingzhe. He even forgot about the pain in his body as he stood up, his face sinister as he pointed at Zhu Tianlei and Yang Xiaoxue.</p><p>"Get out!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei ignored Xu Mingzhe. In his mind, a man who could not protect his own woman was not worth living.</p><p>Xu Mingzhe knew he was no match for Zhu Tianlei. Although he felt angry and unwilling to accept it, he slunk out of the room, his tail between his legs.</p><p>"Xiaoxue..."</p><p>Only after Xu Mingzhe had left did Zhu Tianlei softly call Yang Xiaoxue's name.</p><p>"Tianlei, I have caused you trouble. This Xu Mingzhe is not a good person; he has been bothering me since college, but I never thought he would dare come to Hamagou. You beat him up, County Magistrate Yang will definitely not let it go easily. I..."</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue felt very guilty, even somewhat regretting that she had called Zhu Tianlei. County Magistrate Yang loved his nephew immensely, almost to the point of indulgence, and he had many connections in Dahexian County. If one really wanted to deal with Zhu Tianlei, it would be a piece of cake.</p><p>"Simpleton, what are you saying? What do you mean by trouble? Your matters are mine. However, I'm very glad that you thought of me first."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said it sincerely, almost the most serious thing Yang Xiaoxue had heard from him since they started dating.</p><p>"You're the one who's simpleton!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue was deeply moved and couldn't help but snuggle closer to Zhu Tianlei's chest again.</p><p>The night was long. After the previous commotion, neither of them felt sleepy, so they decided to sit on a bamboo bed in the middle of the room, chatting sporadically as the moonlight fell upon them and time quietly passed.</p><p>That night, though there was no secret meeting, their feelings were deep as the sea.</p><p>"Oh dear, I'm going to be late for class!"</p>

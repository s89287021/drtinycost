While they thanked him, he felt immense gratitude toward them as well; in just one month, it seemed he had gained new perspectives on himself and life.</p><p>When everyone slowly dispersed, several graceful figures appeared in Zhu Tianlei's line of sight.</p><p>Four women, each holding a large bouquet of fresh flowers, stood in the sunlight, smiling at her.</p><p>Behind them, Mao Yaoyi with her pretty short hair smiled radiantly as well.</p><p>Their gazes met, and each person’s lips slowly curled upward. After surviving such trauma, they could only embrace beauty for the rest of their lives.</p><p>At the women's insistence, Zhu Tianlei took a bath, changed clothes, crossed the fire basin, and was even forced to wear a pair of red panties.</p><p>Returning to her home which she had left for a month, Zhu Tianlei suddenly felt his eyes welling up with tears.</p><p>Zhu Quezi and Hou Suqin said nothing, but from their obviously grayed hair, Zhu Tianlei could imagine the torment they had endured over the past month.</p><p>After dinner.</p><p>As usual, Zhu Quezi turned on the television. Watching evening news was a habit Zhu Quezi had developed over the years.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stretched his arms and planned to go out for a walk. Having been confined in the isolation zone for a month, he needed to find an opportunity to be close to his woman.</p><p>But before he could leave, he heard the sound of the television.</p><p>"President Tang, you have developed this special drug to treat 'Deng Luolin Virus,' which can be considered a great benefit to humanity. Could you please tell us about the process of developing this drug?"</p><p>"You are too kind. As a medical worker, my responsibility is to heal the sick and injured. As long as I can alleviate the patients' suffering and contribute to the country, it is my honor. Although the process was lengthy, it was necessary and not worth mentioning."</p><p>On the screen, Tang Wen wore a silver-gray Zhongshan suit, his hair slightly gray, wearing gold-rimmed glasses, smiling gracefully.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei clenched his fists.</p><p>"Tianlei, what’s going on here? The drug was clearly developed by you, how did it become Tang Wen's achievement?"</p><p>Hao Xinmei's phone call came almost immediately after the news was broadcast.</p><p>"I don't know either," Zhu Tianlei said truthfully. He couldn't figure out what Tang Wen was up to now. In his memory, Tang Wen had always been a very competent dean, and he had praised Tang Wen in front of Yang Wenhua more than once.</p><p>"Wait here, I'll be right over!" Hao Xinmei hung up the phone angrily. Why should she, Hao Xinmei, be treated as someone to bully?</p><p>Mao Yu slammed the folder on the table with a bang and rushed out of the office seconds later.</p><p>"Tianlei, did you see the news? What's going on here? How could the medicine become Vice Dean Tang's project?"</p><p>Li Ping and Li Yong's phones rang one after another.</p><p>Tang Wen had always been popular in the hospital. Compared to Wei Baoguo, who was rigid and looked down on everyone, Tang Wen was a nice guy, and most of the staff respected him. Therefore, when this incident happened, Li Ping's tone carried a hint of disbelief.</p><p>Less than two hours later, Zhu's courtyard became bustling with activity.</p><p>Not only did several women arrive, but Song Binián and Yang Hua also rushed over after hearing about it.</p><p>When the health bureau issued the call for medical aid, Yang Hua had signed up right away, but her application was rejected due to her age.</p><p>However, both Song Binián and Yang Hua had never lost their interest in Rui Tianlei's isolation zone research. Therefore, they knew about Tianlei's discovery of a cure for infectious diseases.</p><p>"Tianlei, what's going on?"</p><p>"President Song, to be frank, I don't know either, but it doesn't matter to me."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's statement wasn't mere politeness; he didn't need anything to bolster or brag about himself. Moreover, he always believed that fate was fair, and taking what wasn't his would eventually come with a price.</p><p>Mao Yü was so enraged that steam seemed to be coming out of her ears, her face filled with fury.</p>

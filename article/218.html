						<p>Zheng Chu's voice was very soft, but for Zhang Gu, who had been married for over a decade, it was crystal clear. The foot he extended immediately came to a halt.</p><p>He could reach his current position today largely thanks to his wife Zheng Jing.</p><p>Mao Fang did not expect the other party to attack her. Without any preparation, she was knocked to the ground, while Guan Xiaojie instantly rushed to Zhu Tianlei's side.</p><p>"Dad!"</p><p>Seeing Guan Yunli lying on the ground with his eyes tightly shut, Guan Xiaojie screamed and tried to rush over.</p><p>"Don't come near him!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's treatment was at a critical stage; the bleeding point inside his ribcage had been located, and he was using Soul Rebirth Qi to stop the bleeding.</p><p>"Who are you? Let go of my dad!"</p><p>Guan Xiaojie saw that Zhu Tianlei was young, wearing a casual jacket over jeans and soft leather boots. Although he did not look like a bad person, he certainly did not look like a good one either. Her father had coronary heart disease, always in danger of his life, and now this unknown boy had his hand on her father's chest.</p><p>Didn't he know that heart patients needed sufficient oxygen after an attack?</p><p>"Xiaojie, Secretary Guan looks very angry!"</p><p>Zheng Jing coldly glanced at Zhu Tianlei, who was squatting on the ground. Qiu Ran said that it was this boy who had been secretly watching from outside the door just now. Humph, what kind of person was she, Zheng Jing? If she couldn't kill him, she might as well not be the Director of the Discipline Inspection Commission.</p><p>Hearing Zheng Jing's words, Guan Xiaojie became even more frantic. Seeing that Zhu Tianlei did not let go, she immediately rushed over.</p><p>She was a champion in women's taekwondo—could she really be unable to handle this young punk?</p><p>As Guan Xiaojie rushed forward, Zhu Tianlei's eyes darkened.</p><p>What an ungrateful woman.</p><p>Almost in the blink of an eye, Guan Xiaojie's palm wind approached Zhu Tianlei's face. To her utter surprise, despite being self-assured about her skills, she did not even touch Zhu Tianlei before being swept away by a gust of air. Had it not been for her solid martial arts foundation, she would have likely been thrown out.</p><p>Guan Xiaojie was secretly startled.</p><p>Even Zheng Jing was immensely surprised. Although Qiu Ran wore an expression of disdain, he was also shaken in his heart; he could clearly sense that Zhu Tianlei's abilities had grown significantly.</p><p>"You...... actually dared to hit me?"</p><p>Guan Xiaojie stared at Zhu Tianlei in disbelief. Ever since she started learning taekwondo, it had always been her who struck others, and with her father being the chief of the Public Security Bureau, she could walk around as if no one else mattered—no one would dare to object. Now, this brat actually dared to lay a hand on her?</p><p>"Ma Tianming, come in!"</p><p>Despite her anger, Guan Xiaojie knew very well that she was no match for Zhu Tianlei. However, she couldn't ignore her father; ever since she lost her mother at a young age, it had been her father who raised her with utmost care, and he was the entirety of her world—she would absolutely not allow anything to happen to him.</p><p>Upon hearing Guan Xiaojie call out Ma Tianming's name, a hint of satisfaction appeared in Zheng Jing's eyes.</p><p>Humph, as if heaven itself aided her!</p><p>As soon as Guan Xiaojie finished speaking, a chubby man walked in from outside the door. He had a round face covered with acne, and there was also one on his nose bridge, making his already sizable nose resemble a bulbous one, giving him an overall unpleasant appearance.</p><p>"Xiao Jie, what do you need me to do?"</p><p>The moment Ma Tianming entered, he beamed at Guan Xiaojie with an obsequious smile.</p><p>"You're still smiling? My father's life is in danger, and you're smiling!"</p><p>"I..... I wasn't laughing, I wasn't......"</p><p>Hearing Guan Xiaojie's words, Ma Tianming immediately suppressed his smile, adopting a solemn expression instead. Tears even welled up in his eyes.</p><p>"Ma Tianming, my father isn't dead yet; why are you crying?"</p><p>Guan Xiaojie was holding a grudge, feeling anxious. Looking at Ma Tianming made everything seem even more wrong.</p><p>Ma Tianming, after being scolded, looked extremely tense and bewildered, neither crying nor laughing, with his expression changing dramatically.</p><p>"I don't care what method you use, get an ambulance to the City Public Security Bureau within ten minutes, and make sure this brat disappears from my sight. Otherwise, don't ever come back to see me again."</p><p>While saying this, Guan Xiaojie stared at her father. Seeing Guan Yunli's chest rise and fall slightly, she finally relaxed a little.</p><p>"Ten minutes... this......"</p><p>What was the joke? Although it was past rush hour, even if the ambulance moved non-stop with green lights all the way, ten minutes probably wouldn't be enough to get there.</p><p>"You can't do it?"</p><p>Seeing Guan Xiaojie's face turn icy cold, Ma Tianming gritted his teeth.</p><p>"I can. I guarantee that the ambulance will arrive within ten minutes."</p><p>After saying this, Ma Tianming took out his phone and walked out. A moment later, he returned.</p><p>"Xiaojie, don't worry, everything is arranged. Uncle Guan will definitely be fine."</p><p>Hearing Ma Tianming say this, Guan Xiaojie finally put her mind at ease, but her gaze at Zhu Tianlei grew increasingly resentful.</p><p>This resentment stemmed from the blow to her proud self-respect, and the fact that the person striking her pride looked younger than she did.</p><p>To all of this, Zhu Tianlei seemed oblivious.</p><p>His actions were simply a matter of duty as a doctor, merely because he admired Guan Yunli.</p><p>"Xiaojie, who is this brat?"</p><p>Seeing Guan Xiaojie's gaze constantly sliding over Zhu Tianlei, Ma Tianming felt extremely uncomfortable. He had pursued Guan Xiaojie for nearly a year, but she had hardly ever given him a proper look, let alone stared at him like this now.</p><p>"Hmph, whoever it is, just make sure he disappears from in front of me before the ambulance arrives."</p><p>Guan Xiaojie snorted coldly. Well, if Ma Tianming could drive this brat away, it would be sweet revenge for her. If she couldn't, she could use this as an excuse to make Ma Tianming disappear from her life.</p><p>"Alright, I'll take care of it."</p><p>Hearing Guan Xiaojie's words, Ma Tianming was instantly relieved. He had finally gotten a chance to show his devotion and he wasn't going to let it slip away.</p><p>With that said, Ma Tianming clapped his hands several times, and soon, seven or eight tall men in black suits walked in.</p><p>"Young Master."</p><p>"Take this brat out and throw him away."</p><p>Ma Tianming commanded from above with an air of authority.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Mao Fang had been pushed to the side by Guan Xiaojie earlier, his elbow grazed against the table and bled. However, remembering that Guan Xiaojie was after all Guan Yunli's daughter, his actions in the heat of the moment could be forgiven. Thus, he sat on one side, resting.</p><p>Later, when Ma Tianming came in, although his words were somewhat inappropriate, it didn't affect Zhu Tianlei, who remained silent.</p><p>But now, with these black-suited men appearing, it was clearly not good for Zhu Tianlei. She stood up again.</p><p>Xiaofang and Xiaotong also stood beside Mao Fang. Earlier, Guan Xiaojie had acted extremely cruelly, kicking them in the groin. Even if they didn't care about their lives, as two young men, they couldn't bear it.</p><p>Standing now, that area still hurt faintly.</p>

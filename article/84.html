						<p>"Doctor Zhu, get in the car. Young Master asked me to take you home!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hesitated for a moment, thinking about all the things he still needed to do once he got back. Hao Xinmei was not in the city either, and the afternoon bus would arrive in two more hours. Therefore, Zhu Tianlei finally decided to get into the car.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, thank you for saving Old Man!"</p><p>After driving a short distance, the young driver suddenly spoke up.</p><p>"Not much."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not have a good impression of Ge Tianying and was not particularly interested in any conversation about him. However, he did not want to appear rude, so he simply replied with a lukewarm acknowledgment.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, Old Man has a straightforward personality; he speaks and acts without beating around the bush. If I offended Doctor Zhu in any way, Sea Ancestral will apologize for Old Man on his behalf!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was slightly surprised. From the tone of Sea Ancestral's voice, it seemed that he had deep feelings for Ge Tianying!</p><p>"How long have you been with the Black Eagle Gang?"</p><p>The journey was long, and Sea Ancestral's words piqued Zhu Tianlei's interest, so he decided to use this as a way to pass the time.</p><p>"I have been raised by Old Man since I was little."</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Sea Ancestral's words shocked Zhu Tianlei. Sea Ancestral had actually grown up with Ge Tianying?</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei's expression in the rearview mirror, Sea Ancestral smiled slightly.</p><p>"Actually, many of the younger generation in the Black Eagle Gang have been raised alongside Old Man since they were little. To us, the Black Eagle Gang is like a big family. Old Man is not just the boss of the Black Eagle Gang; he is our dear family member."</p><p>Sea Ancestral's tone was sincere and free from any trace of exaggeration.</p><p>"Did you hear that Ge Yang also grew up with Father?"</p><p>"Yes, when Shao'er was three years old, his parents were in a car accident and passed away. Father took on the role of both parent to take care of Shao'er. Once, Shao'er contracted acute pneumonia, and Father did not sleep for three days and three nights. By the time Shao'er recovered, Father's heart had developed a condition."</p><p>Recalling this past, Zuhai's voice choked up.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, you saved Father's life; I will never forget this favor. As for others, I don't care, but from now on, whatever Doctor Zhu needs, Zuhai is willing to risk his life!"</p><p>Zitianlei did not speak again. It was uncertain whether he would ever need Zuhai or even if they would cross paths with Ge Yang.</p><p>Seeing Zitianlei close his eyes, Zuhai fell silent as well. The jeep sped down the mountain road and stopped at the village entrance after about forty minutes.</p><p>No sooner had the car come to a stop than Zitianlei opened his eyes, his gaze clear and free of any signs of sleepiness.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, this is something Father asked me to give you!"</p><p>As soon as Zitianlei closed the car door, Zuhai rolled down the window, handed him a black plaque, and without waiting for a response from Zitianlei, started the car, flooring the accelerator, speeding away as if something was chasing after him.</p><p>Zitianlei lowered his head to examine the plaque in his hand, which was about the size of a mobile phone, made of iron, with an eagle engraved on it, spreading its wings and ready to take flight.</p><p>On the back, three large words were carved: 'Black Eagle Gang.'</p><p>Zitianlei found this hilarious, feeling as if he had received some kind of exemption certificate or a pardon from death.</p><p>However, after chuckling, Zitianlei put the item into his file folder and walked towards the clinic.</p><p>"Tianlei is not here, why don't you come back later?"</p><p>Just as he reached the entrance, he saw a short-haired, pretty figure.</p><p>"Consultant Mao!"</p><p>Since Meng Shengjun mentioned Mao Yu's value, Zhu Tianlei's admiration for Mao Yu grew uncontrollably. He decided to give Mao Yu the utmost respect and even refrained from calling him by name, directly addressing him as Consultant Mao.</p><p>Mao Yu turned around and saw Zhu Tianlei, his expression not looking too pleased. Zhu Tianlei inwardly sighed, wondering if he had offended this godlike figure?</p><p>"Why didn't you inform me before Consultant Mao arrived?"</p><p>"Are you displeased with my unsolicited visit?"</p><p>"No no no, of course not. I meant that if Consultant Mao had given me prior notice, I could have personally greeted him at the village entrance to demonstrate my respect and value for him!"</p><p>Riding the tiger's back and flattery came naturally to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, how did you do with the preparations I told you about earlier?"</p><p>Mao Yu placed his hands on his hips, wore an expression of displeasure, and asked sharply.</p><p>Before Zhu Tianlei could respond, Ma Lanlan at the door was already unwilling.</p><p>"Who are you? Tianlei is someone I can reprimand as I please!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face turned awkward, quickly stepping forward to block between Ma Lanlan and Mao Yu.</p><p>"Lanlan, let me formally introduce you. This is Consultant Mao from Tianlei Pharmaceuticals."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei kept giving Ma Lanlan subtle signals. He didn't dare offend Mao Yu; this impulsive young lady couldn't be offended, or else he wouldn't want to drive away such a powerful figure in the American business circle.</p><p>"What's so great about being an enterprise consultant? Tianlei Pharmaceuticals still bears the Rui surname; you're the one making decisions. Why does he get to boss people around here?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei being treated unfairly, Ma Lanlan couldn't stand it, although the victim himself didn't feel wronged at all.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, this is how you show your respect and value for me?"</p><p>Mao Yu glanced at Ma Lanlan, his lips curling upward in a mocking smile as he looked at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Mr. Mao Advisor, Mr. Mao Advisor, Lanlan is young and has a quick temper. Don't hold grudges against little girls like her!"</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, who do you think is the small-minded one? I'm only doing this for your own good. Why are you turning a blind eye to your own people?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei inwardly groaned.</p><p>Oh my heavens, she usually seems so smart, why doesn't she get it at crucial moments? He was clearly buttering her up; how could he be bullying her?</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, when leaders are away from their troops, they most fear unrest at home. If you can't even keep your own household in order, this company might as well close down."</p><p>Mao Yu finished speaking and started to walk away. How could Zhu Tianlei let Mao Yu leave? He couldn't find another genius like her if she walked away; thus, he naturally chased after her.</p><p>As a result, the clinic door slammed shut behind him.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, it seems your girlfriend is angry!"</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was groaning in despair and steam rising from his forehead, Mao Yu suddenly turned around with an evil grin on his face.</p><p>"Were you doing this on purpose?"</p><p>"Of course. I had to test how much you value me as a corporate advisor. Now that I see the result, it's acceptable."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei could only stare speechlessly at the sky!</p><p>It seemed women were all the same everywhere—whether it was the native Ma Lanlan or the powerful businesswoman in America, they were all unreasonable troublemakers at heart.</p><p>"Alright, alright, are you gentlemen really overreacting like this!"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei's forlorn face, Mao Yu sneered. She had never been in a relationship and naturally couldn't understand Zhu Tianlei's current state of mind.</p><p>Sigh, never mind, is Mr. Mao Consultant coming today just to test me?</p>

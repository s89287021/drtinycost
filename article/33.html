						<p>Zhu Tianlei was somewhat surprised. His family had always been one of the least noticed in the village; not even the village head visited them frequently, let alone neighbors.</p><p>When Zhu Quezi saw his son return with Yao Gang behind him, he quickly put on his shoes and rushed out to greet them anxiously.</p><p>In recent days, more people had visited their home than in the past few decades combined.</p><p>Yao Gang was the village head. In Zhu Quezi’s simple-minded view, this official held a position of great importance, so he could not afford to be negligent.</p><p>"Brother Zhu, is your leg better?"</p><p>As soon as Yao Gang stepped into the courtyard, he saw Zhu Quezi rushing out eagerly, walking steadily on both feet.</p><p>"Yes, Tianlei has been giving me injections for several days now, and I can finally walk again!"</p><p>Zhu Quezi felt a bit embarrassed. After being lame for over ten years, suddenly being able to walk again was hard to accept, not just for others but even for himself.</p><p>"Oh my God, Tianlei! You must be a reincarnated deity; your medical skills are simply miraculous!"</p><p>Yao Gang could hardly contain his excitement as he looked at Zhu Quezi.</p><p>This Zhu Tianlei was from Hacham Village. For the village head, this was certainly something to boast about.</p><p>"Village Head, please come in and sit down!"</p><p>It took Zhu Quezi a while to react. He hurriedly pulled Yao Gang inside, but Yao Gang waved him off.</p><p>"Brother Zhu, I came here today to discuss something with you. I’ll be on my way once we’re done; there are still matters to attend to in the village!"</p><p>Zhu Quezi’s heart sank.</p><p>His family had always been law-abiding and honest. What could possibly go wrong? Could it be that Chen the widow was up to something again?</p><p>"It's like this, the village wants to hire Tianlei as a doctor in the clinic and would like to know Brother Zhu and Tianlei's opinions."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Zhu Quezi was secretly guessing what might happen when suddenly, instead of trouble, a big windfall dropped from the sky, immediately stunning Zhu Quezi.</p><p>"Village head, you said you want Tianlei to work at the clinic?"</p><p>"Yes, Brother Zhu, Tianlei is a skilled doctor and very honest and dependable. Having him as a doctor in our Hama Village will be a blessing for the villagers!"</p><p>Aoyang's words really boosted Tianlei's reputation; even Zhu Tianlei, who was standing quietly by the side, couldn't help but inwardly marvel.</p><p>"This.......this......"</p><p>Happiness came so suddenly that Zhu Quezi didn't know what to say at first.</p><p>"Brother Zhu, the village will pay Tianlei 2400 yuan per month and give him a 1000 yuan subsidy at the end of the year. What do you think?"</p><p>Aoyang knew that Tianlei was filial and that even if he was very capable, it was still Zhu Quezi who made the decisions at home. So, he basically talked to Zhu Quezi about this.</p><p>"Tianlei, are you listening?"</p><p>Zhu Quezi finally came back to his senses and quickly pulled Zhu Tianlei over.</p><p>"Village head, doesn't the clinic already have a doctor?"</p><p>Tianlei's first thought wasn't about the 2400 yuan the village was offering but about Ma Lanlan. There were only about 300 households in Hama Gou, so the clinic couldn't afford to hire two doctors. If he went, what would happen to Ma Lanlan?</p><p>"Don't worry, Ma Jia Yaogou is still working at the clinic. However, she studied nursing, and her medical skills can't match yours. Let her assist you; how does that sound? By the way, I've already talked to Ma Jia Yaogou about this, and she has no objections!"</p><p>Aoyang, as the village head, immediately guessed Tianlei's concerns after seeing his expression.</p><p>No matter what was said, it was the last sentence that truly mattered. Ma Lanlan had agreed to it, so Zhu Tianlei immediately felt no more concerns.</p><p>Thinking of being able to spend every day with that girl, joking and teasing each other, made his heart feel full of joy!</p><p>"Alright, Village Head, when should I start working?"</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei agree, Yao Gang rubbed his hands in excitement. He had been afraid that Zhu Tianlei was too proud and would want to go to the city, unwilling to work in this small mountain village. Now he was overjoyed.</p><p>"Go as early as tomorrow morning!"</p><p>Yao Gang thought it best to decide early to avoid any mishaps or changes of heart.</p><p>"Alright, then I'll report for duty at the clinic tomorrow morning!"</p><p>Watching Yao Gang leave hastily, Zhu Quezi's eyes suddenly filled with tears. Zhu Tianlei was startled when he noticed his father's gaze returning.</p><p>"Dad, what happened?"</p><p>"It's nothing, a strong wind blew something into my eye!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the gloomy atmosphere as if it were stagnant water and secretly rolled his eyes. His father was really an expert at lying!</p><p>In the evening, Hou Suqin insisted on cooking several extra dishes. The three of them sat around the table, Zhu Quezi even drinking two cups of baijiu for the first time in a long while. They ate happily, as if this meal marked the beginning of a new chapter for the Zhu family.</p><p>The next morning, Zhu Tianlei deliberately wore a white shirt and blue jeans, carefully combing his hair several times before taking his handbag, which contained Zihuai grass medicine pills and silver needles, out the door.</p><p>Zhu Quezi and Hou Suqin stood at the doorway, watching Zhu Tianlei's figure disappear from view at the intersection.</p><p>The biggest difference between summer in the countryside and the city is that wherever one looks, there are fields of greenery. Even the gloomiest mood would lighten up because of it.</p><p>Whistling a tune, Zhu Tianlei walked briskly toward the clinic.</p><p>The clinic door was slightly ajar. Zhu Tianlei glanced into the room and found no one inside, so he pushed the door open and walked in. This wasn't Zhu Tianlei's first visit to the clinic, but this time his status had changed, affecting his mood accordingly. Zhu Tianlei placed his handbag on the desk and began to walk around, taking it all in. Apart from the two desks at the entrance, there was an iron filing cabinet further inside, containing patient files and medical documents. Behind the filing cabinet stood a medicine cabinet with a glass window that clearly showed neatly arranged medications above and examination and injection equipment below. In the corner's inner side hung a white curtain behind which was a nursing bed used for examinations and intravenous treatments. Just as Zhu Tianlei was about to go out to greet Ma Lanlan, he suddenly noticed the white curtain slightly moving. Mouse? Zhu Tianlei felt bewildered and quietly moved toward the curtain. When he got close enough, he abruptly lifted his hand, pulling up the white cloth curtain. Oh my God! Zhu Tianlei felt a buzzing in his head, followed by something slowly trickling out of his nostrils; he had started bleeding from his nose! "Ah, go away! Don't look!" Behind the curtain stood an elegantly curvaceous woman wearing only a black slip and pink thigh-high stockings. Ma Lanlan covered her chest with both hands and screamed loudly. She had arrived early, hoping to be there before Zhu Tianlei, so she hadn't had time to put on her clothes. She was about to change into her nurse's uniform behind the curtain when Zhu Tianlei unexpectedly walked in at that moment. "Hehe, Lanlan, your hands are too small to cover it!"</p>

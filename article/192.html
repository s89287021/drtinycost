						<p>He saw only you.</p><p>Zhang Yi said.</p><p>Mao Yu was about to react.</p><p>"Alright, I'll go myself.

Truly, youth is where heroes are made!"</p><p>Old Man Yan never would have thought that the chairman of Tianlei Pharmaceuticals was the same young man who had spoken up for him in the ginseng and deer antler market. It really was a small world after all.</p><p>"Old Man, you truly are good at hiding like a pig eating a tiger! Your skills put your junior to shame!"</p><p>If Zhu Tianlei still thought that Old Man Yan was as weak as he seemed on the surface now, he would be foolish indeed.</p><p>He saw only you.</p><p>Zhang Yi said.</p><p>Mao Yu was about to react.</p><p>"Alright, I'll go myself.

Mao Yu was about to react.</p><p>"Alright, I'll go myself," Zhu Tianlei continued. "Please help take care of her, Brother Zhang!" He pointed at Mao Yu standing beside him. Zhang Yi nodded, and Zhu Tianlei left the room, following the direction Zhang Yi had come from, going up the stairs outside the house.</p><p>It turned out that above the three-story building was another floor, although this floor was very small, with an area of less than one-third of a normal floor. The door opened, and a strong smell of medicinal herbs wafted out. Though the lighting in the room wasn't good, Zhu Tianlei could see a figure standing by the window right away.</p><p>"Old Man, we meet again!" he said. The dark silhouette slowly turned around.</p><p>"It's you?" This dark shadow was none other than Old Man Yan, whom Zhu Tianlei had met briefly before. "You're actually the chairman of Tianlei Pharmaceuticals. Truly, youth is where heroes are made!"</p><p>Old Man Yan never would have thought that the chairman of Tianlei Pharmaceuticals was the same young man who had spoken up for him in the ginseng and deer antler market. It really was a small world after all.</p><p>"Old Man, you truly are good at hiding like a pig eating a tiger! Your skills put your junior to shame!" If Zhu Tianlei still thought that Old Man Yan was as weak as he seemed on the surface now, he would be foolish indeed.</p><p>"Haha, I faked producing Qingdan from Tianlei Pharmaceutical. You, Chairman, have come to ask for justice. How could old man I still dare to pretend to be a pig eating a tiger!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was indeed a fierce tiger, truly the king of the jungle!</p><p>"I highly admire your skills, being able to adjust each ingredient in Qingdan precisely without any errors. Not everyone can possess such talent."</p><p>"Overpraising me, old man I am quite familiar with medicines after all, as our ancestors were physicians, but my skills are not as great as you think."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei slightly frowned, as old man clearly had more to say.</p><p>"Young man, Zhang Yi should have told you already, right?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded.</p><p>"What's your opinion?"</p><p>Yan Old Man was even more direct than Zhang Yi. If it were an ordinary person, they would have quietly hid away once meeting the main character, how could they still dare to challenge in front of them?</p><p>"What do you think, old man?"</p><p>"I think you will agree."</p><p>The elderly and young man looked into each other's eyes.</p><p>It seemed as if dust was stirred by some sudden energy floating around both of them.</p><p>After a long while.</p><p>"I agree, but with conditions."</p><p>"Go ahead and say."</p><p>"All personnel are incorporated into Tianlei Pharmaceuticals, with raw materials supplied uniformly by Tianlei Pharmaceuticals. Salaries and other expenses for the staff are also paid by Tianlei Pharmaceuticals. Most importantly, each batch of products must be inspected and approved by Tianlei Pharmaceuticals before going to market; this is a prerequisite and a bottom line."</p><p>From the start until now, Zhu Tianlei has discovered that although this small pharmaceutical factory produces counterfeit drugs, it meets industrial standards in terms of environment, raw materials, and management.</p><p>Old Man Yan and Zhang Yi are both outstanding individuals; even Yuan Zhen is no ordinary person. With such a team, Zhu Tianlei really wants to recruit them.</p><p>"Have you seen those workers?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Do you understand the situation?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Are you certain you won't regret it?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>The exchange between the two became more and more resolute on Zhu Tianlei's part.</p><p>Those people are all deaf-mutes, so every command by Yuan Zhen is accompanied by gestures. Therefore, even if they attack, it happens silently.</p><p>However, these workers are well-trained. Whether in production or formation, there is no sign that they are disabled, and the effort put into their training can be imagined.</p><p>Moreover, the respect and reverence in the way these people look at Zhang Yi comes from within. Force and coercion can make people comply but cannot win their trust, let alone respect.</p><p>Therefore, a person who accommodates the disabled, treats them kindly, gives them dignity to survive, and teaches them life skills is someone one truly finds hard to hate, even if they produce counterfeit drugs.</p><p>"Mumu didn't misjudge you!"</p><p>Suddenly, Old Man Yan said something, immediately breaking the solemn atmosphere.</p><p>"Mumu?"</p><p>"It's true, that girl has a very high opinion of you!"</p><p>Mentioning Mumu, Old Master Yan's facial features softened.</p><p>"Old Master, this is unacceptable. You actually sent someone into my inner circle! Moreover, if you were to send someone, couldn't it be a more normal person? That girl almost dismantled Tianlei Pharmaceuticals."</p><p>Upon learning that the notorious troublemaker was Old Master Yan's person, Zhu Tianlei immediately became displeased.</p><p>"That girl wasn't sent by me. In the end, my little pharmaceutical company could even produce Medicine of Clearness identical to Tianlei Pharmaceuticals thanks to her efforts!"</p><p>Recalling the image of the girl pretending to eat ginseng as if it were a radish in his medicinal field, Zhu Tianlei felt stabbed in the heart again.</p><p>Oh, no wonder. That girl seemed to be causing trouble everywhere she went, but was actually stealing Tianlei Pharmaceuticals' secrets!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei suddenly realized and also remembered Yao Jianxiong's close relationship with that little girl. All of his doubts were instantly cleared up.</p><p>"Tianlei, don't blame Little Mu either. She is a child from a hard life. Her father was framed and put in prison, where he will most likely be sentenced to death. Despite her studying abroad, she insisted on dropping out to return upon hearing the news."</p><p>Old Master Yan shook his head with a sigh as he spoke.</p><p>"Before her father went in, he set up a small factory to support those disabled individuals. Now that he's inside, these disabled people have no place to go, so this is what she came up with."</p><p>"Who is Mumu to Old Master?"</p><p>Old Master Yan raised his head slightly, his eyes cloudy with age.</p><p>"She is my granddaughter. Her mother surnamed Mu, which is why the child was named Yan Mumu."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's eyes widened. So that girl even lied about her name.</p><p>"Does Uncle Yan have a scar on his chin?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei suddenly thought of someone.</p><p>"Yes, how do you know?"</p><p>Yan Laogou was shocked, even more so than when he learned that Zhu Tianlei was the chairman of Tianlei Pharmaceutical.</p><p>"We've met."</p><p>Truly...</p><p>Could this be what they call fate predetermined?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei briefly recounted his encounter with Yan Daitou, naturally omitting the identities of Qiao Jang and Mao Fang.</p><p>"My son... sigh..."</p><p>Yan Laogou sighed.</p><p>Although he knew that his son was innocent, he lacked evidence and connections. He didn't even have a powerful background or mentor to rely on. His only hope was to take good care of Xiaomu and the disabled people left behind by his son.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained silent but made up his mind internally.</p>

						<p>Zhu Tianlei took another look at the business card in his hand, then casually put it into his pocket and glanced at his van.</p><p>The quality of domestic products is really quite good. The Porsche was totaled from the collision, while the van had only two dents.</p><p>Huh huh, I should support domestic products in the future.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took another look at the positions of the two cars, gave a chuckle, and slowly drove his van into a parking space.</p><p>This time, no one would snatch it away from me.</p><p>By the time Zhu Tianlei reached the entrance of the municipal public security bureau building, the gate had just been opened.</p><p>Thinking back to last time when he came to the city bureau, he was brought there as a suspect. Today, he could come so quickly to clear his name.</p><p>Entering the city bureau, Zhu Tianlei looked around and thought about what Mao Fang said about the conference hall number 2, circling a few times but not finding it.</p><p>"Excuse me, officer, could you please tell me where the conference hall number 2 is......"</p><p>Just then, Zhu Tianlei saw a female police officer walking out of an office nearby. He shouted from behind, but when the woman turned around, Zhu Tianlei was taken aback.</p><p>It's a small world after all.</p><p>This woman was none other than the female police officer who had interrupted her phone call to transfer Zhu Tianlei to the detention center last time.</p><p>"Officer Wang, it's been a while!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei searched his memory for her name; she seemed to be named Wang Lin.</p><p>"Do we know each other?"</p><p>The Porsche that had been hit remained stationary where it was, and Bao Hong did not even spare it a glance.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the business card in his hand and casually slipped it into his pocket before casting a look at his van.</p><p>Domestic products truly are of high quality. The Porsche was totaled from the collision, whereas the van had merely two dents.</p><p>Hmm, I should support domestic products in the future.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei observed the positions of the two vehicles once more, let out a chuckle, and slowly steered his van into a parking space.</p><p>This time, no one would snatch it away from me.</p><p>By the time Zhu Tianlei reached the entrance of the municipal public security bureau building, the gate had just been opened.</p><p>Recalling his previous visit to the city bureau when he was brought there as a suspect, he could now clear his name so quickly today.</p><p>Entering the city bureau, Zhu Tianlei looked around in search of the conference hall number 2. He circled several times but failed to locate it.</p><p>"Excuse me, officer, could you please tell me where conference hall number 2 is......"</p><p>Just then, a female police officer emerged from an office nearby. Zhu Tianlei called out to her from behind, but upon turning around, he was taken aback.</p><p>What a coincidence.</p><p>This woman was none other than the female police officer who had interrupted her phone call to transfer him to the detention center last time.</p><p>"Officer Wang, it's been a while!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei searched his memory for her name; she seemed to be named Wang Lin.</p><p>"Do we know each other?"</p><p>The Porsche, having been struck, remained motionless, and Bao Hong didn't even give it a glance.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the business card in his hand before casually slipping it into his pocket and then cast an eye over his van.</p><p>The quality of domestic products is truly commendable. While the Porsche was totaled from the collision, the van had only suffered two dents.</p><p>Hmm, I should support domestic products in the future.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei observed the positions of the two vehicles once more, let out a chuckle, and slowly maneuvered his van into a parking space.</p><p>This time, no one would snatch it away from me.</p><p>By the time Zhu Tianlei reached the entrance of the municipal public security bureau building, the gate had just been opened.</p><p>Recalling his previous visit to the city bureau when he was brought there as a suspect, he could now clear his name so quickly today.</p><p>Entering the city bureau, Zhu Tianlei looked around in search of conference hall number 2.

Zhu Tianlei called out to her from behind, but upon turning around, he was taken aback.</p><p>What a coincidence.</p><p>This woman was none other than the female police officer who had interrupted her phone call to transfer him to the detention center last time.</p><p>"Officer Wang, it's been a while!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei searched his memory for her name; she seemed to be named Wang Lin.</p><p>"Do we know each other?"</p><p>Wang Lin looked at Zhu Tianlei and was stunned for a moment.</p><p>"Officer Wang is not young, but his memory sure isn't good."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pursed his lips.</p><p>"This is the police station. You should pay attention to your behavior."</p><p>Watching Zhu Tianlei's eyes moving back and forth on her, with an attitude of carelessness and disdain, Wang Lin's face darkened.</p><p>"How have my manners changed? Officer Wang, are you planning to silently take me to custody like last time?"</p><p>As soon as Zhu Tianlei finished his sentence, Wang Lin's eyes widened instantly.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>"It seems that Officer Wang has remembered. I recall saying that I hope Officer Wang would be as arrogant the next time we meet."</p><p>Wang Lin's face was dark, but this time, she did not say anything like before; instead, she glared fiercely at Zhu Tianlei and turned to leave.</p><p>After about seven or eight minutes of wandering, Zhu Tianlei finally found Meeting Hall No. 2 in the corner on the second floor.</p><p>Just as he was about to walk over, he heard voices coming from an office nearby, causing him to stop in his tracks.</p><p>The door to the office was slightly ajar. Zhu Tianlei pressed his eye to the crack and saw two people standing by the desk inside: one facing away from him, a man, and the other facing Zhu Tianlei, a woman.</p><p>He did not know who the man was but could only observe the woman.</p><p>She was in her early forties, about 1.67 meters tall with a slender figure and fair skin. Although she did not look as full of youthful vigor as a young girl, there was an alluring charm about her, especially the two high peaks beneath her tight white sweater.</p><p>Chiu Ran, you have thought this through, right? The opportunity is once in a lifetime.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's body trembled. This man facing away from him was Chiu Ran?</p><p>"Do you have that kind of ability?"</p><p>It was indeed Chiu Ran's voice.</p><p>"Haha, Chiu Ran, this isn't something you should be considering. You just need to think about whether or not you meet my requirements."</p><p>The woman smiled, her eyes sparkling with charm. Such a woman truly had the magnetism to make men fall for her, though it was unclear what kind of game these two were playing.</p><p>"Chief Zheng, aren't you afraid that Director Zhang will discover this?"</p><p>Director Zhang—could it be Zhang Gu?</p><p>"Haha, discover? What's there to fear in discovery? We've been living separately for several years now. He does his thing, and I do mine, with no interference. Are you afraid of him?"</p><p>"I'm certainly afraid. As a deputy director of the county bureau, your husband is a director at the city bureau. He could wipe me out in an instant."</p><p>Chiu Ran's voice carried a hint of hoarseness and unwillingness.</p><p>"Chiu Ran, if you want to advance, it's not impossible. I was able to elevate Zhang Gu to his current position, and I can do the same for you. However, that depends on your performance..."</p><p>After saying this, the woman placed her hand on Chiu Ran's shoulder, not just a casual touch but one tinged with provocation.</p><p>"Then let Chief Zheng inspect the goods!"</p><p>With that, Chiu Ran hugged the woman tightly and kissed her mouth.</p><p>"Mmm..."</p><p>Two people kissed for no more than a few seconds, and Qiu Ran pushed the woman onto the nearby desk. Without pausing, he lifted her sweater up and then quickly pulled down her bra.</p><p>"I didn’t expect that Zhen Chu’s place is so spacious. It seems Zhang Ju must have quite some talent."</p><p>Qiu Ran’s voice was filled with lecherousness. The woman called Zhen Chu seemed excited instead.</p><p>"I was born with it, Qiu Ran. Do you like it?"</p><p>"Yes, I do. If I had known this earlier, would I be able to wait until today?"</p><p>As he spoke, Qiu Ran lowered his head and rubbed against the woman’s chest.</p><p>"Are you comfortable, Zhen Chu?"</p><p>"Xiao Qiu....."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei watched as the man and woman in the room entangled themselves. Although he couldn’t help but experience some physiological responses as a man, he felt contempt for this scene.</p><p>"Good morning, Zhang Ju!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei greeted Zhang Gu as he came up the stairs, his voice loud.</p><p>He glanced through the door crack to see the two people inside who were about to perform an episode of reality TV, desperately separating and hastily tidying their clothes, looking utterly pathetic. Zhu Tianlei sneered inwardly.</p><p>When Zhang Gu saw that the person greeting him was Zhu Tianlei, he momentarily froze. He had a feeling akin to a weasel paying New Year’s respects to a chicken, but no matter what, he couldn’t afford to provoke Zhu Tianlei. Therefore, despite his reluctance, he forced a smile onto his face.</p><p>"Boss Zhu is here so early!"</p><p>"Yes, I’ve been here for a while now!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei intentionally made this sentence louder so that the two people inside could hear it.</p><p>Zhang Gu was slightly taken aback and clearly felt that Zhu Tianlei's words were a bit strange, though he couldn't quite put his finger on why.</p><p>"Then let's go. The meeting is about to start."</p><p>Everyone knew what the meeting was for.</p><p>"Director Zhang, please!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei tugged at the corner of his mouth, glanced at the half-closed office door, and indeed had a rather bold attitude; not only did he sneak around in the police station, but he didn't even bother to close the door.</p><p>Zhang Gu, puzzled, followed Zhu Tianlei's gaze to look at that door as well, but saw nothing.</p><p>However, his police instincts told him that there was definitely more than just coincidence in Zhu Tianlei's gaze towards that door.</p>

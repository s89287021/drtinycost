						<p>"What?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei raised his eyebrows. He had thought of many possibilities, but he never imagined that the Shengshi Group would buy land to build a cemetery.</p><p>"Specific details are unclear to me; I only heard that the chairman once consulted a very renowned feng shui master about choosing a burial site for his mother. The feng shui master spent almost half a year on it and finally informed the chairman that Hama Gou was the feng shui paradise for building a cemetery."</p><p>These wealthy people, to build houses for the dead, disregard the well-being of the living. He really wanted to take a look at this Shengshi Group.</p><p>After Zhang Qiang finished speaking, Zhu Tianlei walked to each security guard in turn, helping them set their broken bones and using spiritual energy to heal their severe injuries.</p><p>Only then did he leave Lianggangzi without a backward glance, leaving Zhang Qiang and the other security personnel with various expressions as they watched Zhu Tianlei's figure gradually disappear into the distance.</p><p>Back in the village, Zhu Tianlei wandered around at the entrance for a while before finally heading to the village office.</p><p>This matter must be discussed thoroughly with Yao Gang. Given Li Xu's attitude, this issue would likely not end there.</p><p>"Tianlei, are you looking for the village chief?"</p><p>Just as he entered the village office, he ran into Shanzhen, the village accountant, who was thirty-six years old and had a very round appearance. She always smiled first when meeting people and handled matters with great tact.</p><p>"Sister-in-law, I'm looking for the village chief."</p><p>"That's unfortunate; the village chief has been away for a while now. Perhaps you should come back tomorrow!"</p><p>"Tomorrow?"</p><p>"Yes, the village chief left by limousine, claiming to go into town. It seems he won't be back before dark!"</p><p>Shanzhen spoke about this matter with evident envy. As they say, being an official is good; she had seen that limousine herself earlier and it was so shiny it almost blinded her.</p><p>"Sister-in-law, how long has the village chief been away?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was on the verge of panic. In his agitation, he grabbed Shan Xing's arm.</p><p>"Ah! Tianlei, what's wrong? We've been walking for almost an hour... Ah, ah, Tianlei, where are you going...?"</p><p>Hearing Shan Xing's words, Zhu Tianlei did not dare to delay for a moment and ran out of the village office immediately.</p><p>It was not yet one o'clock in the afternoon. The car heading to the city would take more than an hour, but he could not wait that long.</p><p>"Uncle Hu, can I borrow your motorcycle? I'll return it to you tonight!"</p><p>In his desperation, Zhu Tianlei suddenly thought of Uncle Da Niu's motorcycle and immediately raced toward Uncle Da Niu's house without hesitation.</p><p>Seeing the panting Zhu Tianlei, Uncle Da Niu was surprised. Upon hearing that Zhu Tianlei wanted to borrow the motorcycle, he quickly pushed the motorcycle out of the storage room and topped it up with fuel.</p><p>"Don't be in such a hurry, ride slowly, Tianlei! It rained heavily the other day; there's mud all over the road!"</p><p>"I understand, Uncle Hu!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei started the motorcycle before even leaving the courtyard. With a roar, when Uncle Da Niu reached the gate, Zhu Tianlei and his motorcycle were already out of sight.</p><p>Riding the motorcycle, Zhu Tianlei sped like lightning, with the wind whistling past his ears.</p><p>He was almost certain that Yao Gang had been taken away by those people.</p><p>Damn it!</p><p>While riding, Zhu Tianlei cursed the Shengshi Group and Li Xu in his heart to no end. He regretted not beating Li Xu up on Lianggangzi directly.</p><p>Riding at over one hundred eighty miles per hour, with hardly any pedestrians or vehicles on the road, Zhu Tianlei arrived below the Shengshi Group building within an hour.</p><p>After arriving in Yunhai City, he had briefly asked Hao Xinmei about some news regarding the Shengshi Group. However, he did not tell Hao Xinmei that he was already in Yunhai City nor did he reveal his purpose for this trip.</p><p>The office building of Shengshi Group is located in the outskirts of Yunhai City, far inferior to Meixin Pharmaceutical's office building by at least several tiers. Nevertheless, it can still be described as magnificent and imposing.</p><p>A pair of giant stone lions over two meters tall stand guard at the entrance gate, their glaring round eyes exuding a formidable presence.</p><p>"Hey, what are you doing here? There’s a company rule that prohibits parking outside the building. Move your vehicle immediately!"</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei turned off his motorcycle, a man in a black suit emerged from the building.</p><p>Recalling those men in black who had attacked him earlier, Zhu Tianlei could guess this man's identity.</p><p>"I'm looking for someone. I'll be back shortly!"</p><p>Thinking of Zhang Qiang, Zhu Tianlei suppressed his anger and impatience, trying to remain calm as he spoke to the security guard.</p><p>"Who are you looking for?"</p><p>"I’m looking for Assistant Li!"</p><p>Upon hearing "Assistant Li," the security guard's originally indifferent expression abruptly narrowed into smaller pupils, followed by a darkening of his face.</p><p>"Looking for Assistant Li? There is no such person. Move along, don't block the entrance!"</p><p>No such person?</p><p>The significant change in attitude before and after made it clear that Li Xu was indeed an employee of Shengshi Group. So why would the security guard act this way?</p><p>"I am determined to get inside today. If you try to avoid me, I'll enter normally. But if you don’t, don't blame me for being ruthless!"</p><p>"Hmph, quite a mouthful! Do you really think Shengshi Group is a place where one can run wild?"</p><p>"Move aside!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei no longer felt like wasting his words with the security guard. Yao Gang, who had been taken away by Assistant Li, was definitely in a difficult situation.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei merely stretched out his arm, and the security guard felt as if he were enveloped by a gust of wind, spinning around before finally seeing Zhu Tianlei's figure quickly disappear into the building’s entrance.</p><p>"Help! Someone is forcibly entering the building!"</p><p>Now, broad daylight, he had actually allowed someone to directly enter the building! If Captain Security found out, his job would definitely be on the line.</p><p>As he shouted loudly, several similarly dressed security guards rushed in from all directions. However, by the time they understood what had happened, Zhu Tianlei's figure was already gone at the elevator entrance.</p><p>The group instantly acted like a school of startled fish, scattering in all directions. The Level One Defense Alarm of Shengshi Group sounded one minute later.</p><p>On the sixth floor, in an office overlooking the window.</p><p>Li Xu puffed on his cigarette, glaring fiercely at Yao Gang sitting on a single sofa.</p><p>He had already been negotiating with Yao Gang for a year, using every persuasive and coercive method possible, but Yao Gang was like a porcupine, leaving no room for attack.</p><p>Initially, he had made a solemn vow in front of Chairman Min Shengjun to secure the land at Hamagou within six months.</p><p>Now that a year had passed and there were finally some signs of progress, things were disrupted by this poor kid who appeared out of nowhere. With no choice, he could only take the risk and force Yao Gang's agreement, after which everything would be resolved easily.</p>

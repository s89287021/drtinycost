						<p>"Hmph, you brat, if you're smart enough, leave that little bastard for me. I won't make things difficult for you; otherwise, don't blame me if my gun goes off!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei twisted his lips and turned to look at Ge Yang.</p><p>"Little brother, it looks like we'll have to stay a bit longer!"</p><p>Lu Kang was thoroughly enraged by Zhu Tianlei's attitude and clicked the safety catch, loading the pistol.</p><p>"Where are you taking him? I'm definitely taking him with me. You don't need to agree to that. As for what you said, it depends on whether you're capable or not!"</p><p>"You... I'll shoot you!"</p><p>Lu Kang was boiling with anger. He wasn't inexperienced in dealing with lives; he was about to take his wife and child out of the country, and no one would ever trace him if he shot this kid.</p><p>As he spoke, the sound of a bullet whizzing out of the chamber echoed through the room.</p><p>The bullet sped like a swift falcon through the night, hurtling towards Zhu Tianlei. Lu Kang's eyes were eerily cold, more terrifying than the bullet itself.</p><p>"Big Brother!"</p><p>Ge Yang screamed as his blood turned to ice in his veins.</p><p>But just when Ge Yang and Lu Kang thought Zhu Tianlei would be hit by the bullet and become a corpse, Zhu Tianlei suddenly and strangely ducked. The bullet grazed Zhu Tianlei's arm and shot into the wall opposite with a bang.</p><p>"You... you..."</p><p>Lu Kang was completely stunned by what he saw. How could this be? He had practiced his aim intensively; almost every shot hit its mark. And at such close range, how could anyone dodge his bullet?</p><p>"You... who are you?"</p><p>"I've already told you, I came to take him away. But now, I have an extra task!"</p><p>Looking at Zhu Tianlei slowly approaching him, Lu Kang instinctively took a step back.</p><p>“What are you doing? I’m Lu Kang, the boss of Black Eagle Society. If you dare...”</p><p>Lu Kang, the boss of Black Eagle Society, actually stumbled over his words when saying this.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei walked to Lu Kang’s side and reached out to take the gun from Lu Kang’s hand. To Lu Kang’s surprise, he seemed paralyzed and made no resistance at all.</p><p>Holding the pistol in his hand, Lu Kang stared wide-eyed at the gun that had accompanied him for over a decade, drenched in his blood and sweat. Zhu Tianlei forcefully twisted the barrel and folded it in half.</p><p>“My name is Zhu Tianlei!”</p><p>After saying this, Zhu Tianlei stuffed the now mutilated gun back into Lu Kang’s hand and softly said,</p><p>His voice was steady, each word piercing to the heart.</p><p>Lu Kang stood rooted to the spot, tightly gripping the useless pistol. His legs went weak as he helplessly watched Zhu Tianlei and Ge Yang slowly disappear into the night.</p><p>Once their figures completely vanished, Lu Kang suddenly slumped to the ground with a thud.</p><p>The breeze blew in, and Lu Kang realized that his entire body was soaked in sweat.</p><p>......</p><p>“Get in the car!”</p><p>The taxi was still parked outside, but the engine roared, indicating it was about to start.</p><p>On the taxi’s dashboard, the time read exactly 24:00. When Zhu Tianlei got in, it was 23:40—twenty minutes, not a second more or less.</p><p>After getting into the car, Zhu Tianlei leaned his head against the seatback and closed his eyes.</p><p>No one knew that Zhu Tianlei's heart was racing at that moment. He was also feeling scared, after all, it had been bullets, not punches. But if he had shown the slightest panic back then, the outcome would have been unpredictable.</p><p>"Big brother, thank you. My name is Ge Yang!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei instructed the taxi to take Ge Yang directly home. Originally, he wanted to leave Ge Yang and return to the hotel, but seeing Ge Yang's pale face and a slow reaction to bloodshed, Zhu Tianlei ultimately got out of the car with him.</p><p>"My name is Zhu Tianlei. Where do you live? I'll take you back!"</p><p>"No...no need, big brother. I can go home by myself."</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, Ge Yang suddenly became panicked and stammered.</p><p>"Alright then, go ahead, I'm watching you!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not insist. He had rescued Ge Yang without expecting any repayment, only out of the principle of seeing something through to the end.</p><p>"That...that's a lot of trouble for you, big brother!"</p><p>Ge Yang seemed about to refuse but, upon seeing Zhu Tianlei's calm expression, changed his tone and hurriedly walked towards the alley entrance.</p><p>Soon enough, a house in the alley lit up, followed by a loud commotion.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei listened for a while before slowly walking back to the hotel along the small path.</p><p>The next day, he slept until mid-morning.</p><p>"Knock knock knock!"</p><p>A knocking sound came from outside. Zhu Tianlei rubbed his eyes and opened the door to find Li Xu standing there.</p><p>"What are you doing here?"</p><p>Yao Gang came out of the bathroom and, upon seeing Li Xu, his eyes immediately perked up. It was this Li Xu who almost cost him his life.</p><p>"Village Chief Yao, Brother Tian Lei, I know that what happened before was my fault. I don't want to defend myself about it. I came today to deliver something."</p><p>Zhu Tian Lei remained silent while Yao Gang's face remained as ugly as ever.</p><p>"This is fifty thousand yuan, which I've saved over the past two years. Although it's not much, it is a bit of my heart. Please, Village Chief Yao and Brother Tian Lei, help me hand this money over to those sick villagers. Tell them that Li Xu regrets his actions and will be a beast of burden in his next life to redeem his sins!"</p><p>Having said that, without waiting for Zhu Tian Lei or Yao Gang to respond, Li Xu threw the bank card on the shoe-changing stool at the door and hurriedly left.</p><p>"Hmph, as if money can make ghosts grind the mill!"</p><p>Watching Li Xu rush away, Yao Gang spat in anger. He had never been so frightened in his life, so his attitude toward Li Xu was unlikely to improve.</p><p>"Tian Lei, what are you thinking?"</p><p>Yao Gang muttered a lot of curses before finally noticing that Zhu Tian Lei hadn't said a word. His gaze was far off, seemingly lost in thought.</p><p>"Village Chief, don't you think this Li Xu seems suspicious?"</p><p>"Of course he does. What is this? It's like a cat crying for mice or a weasel paying respects to chickens. If it weren't for you, Huizi and those ten or so villagers wouldn't have been alive. He thinks that giving fifty thousand yuan will end the matter, which is impossible!"</p><p>"That's not what I'm saying. His words are strange; he talked about the next life... Something bad is going to happen!"</p><p>A thought quickly flashed through Zhu Tian Lei's mind. Without explaining further to Yao Gang, he grabbed a t-shirt from the bed and rushed out.</p><p>"Hey, hey, hey, Tian Lei, where are you going?"</p><p>Yao Gang's voice echoed behind him, but Zhu Tian Lei had already sprinted down to the first floor just in time to see Li Xu standing in the middle of the road with a bustling flow of cars and blaring horns.</p><p>"Li Xu!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was startled in his heart; he had indeed guessed right! Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's voice, Li Xu turned around and smiled at him before running towards an approaching sedan. "Bang!" A loud explosion followed, accompanied by the screeching of brakes. Zhu Tianlei watched as Li Xu lay on the middle of the road, looking like a rag doll, with a pool of red blood beneath his body.</p>

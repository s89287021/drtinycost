						<p>A well-intentioned person walked over, picking up the herbs that had been evaluated by Zhu Tianlei. Indeed, upon closer inspection, the herbs were indeed problematic.</p><p>"Feng Qi, you must report this Yue Xiume to the Market Supervision Office! This is ruining our market's reputation!"</p><p>"Yes, yes, such people are simply scoundrels!"</p><p>......</p><p>When the tree falls, the monkeys scatter; when the wall collapses, everyone pushes. And how could it be otherwise when Yue Xiume had always been unpopular.</p><p>In an instant, accusations and shouts filled the air.</p><p>"It's not necessary; I've already seen it!"</p><p>A stern-looking middle-aged man emerged with a deep blue short-sleeved uniform.</p><p>"Director Cai."</p><p>The visitor was precisely Director Cai Fuhe of the Ginseng and Deer Antler Market Supervision Office. Cai Fuhe was a former soldier who had been injured on the battlefield, leaving him disabled in his limbs. As such, after his rehabilitation, he was assigned as the director of the Ginseng and Deer Antler Market Supervision Office.</p><p>Like Feng Qi, Cai Fuhe was also a person with a very upright character, refusing to bend even under pressure. Therefore, he had high prestige at the Ginseng and Deer Antler Market.</p><p>"Yue Xiume, I have already given you an opportunity before, but never expected that you would remain obstinate. Since that is the case, Da Fa Herbs will now close down immediately. You may resume operations only when your rectification measures meet our standards."</p><p>Cai Fuhe kept a cold face as he pulled out a large roll of red tape from his waistband, tore it open with a snap, and sealed all the herbs mentioned by Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Yue Xiume's body completely collapsed.</p><p>Although Cai Fuhe was only the director of the market inspection office, his strength was not to be underestimated; at least, Yue Xiume dared not provoke him.</p><p>She glared at Zhu Tianlei with hatred in her eyes, wishing she could peel his skin off and extract every tendon.</p><p>"Where's the money?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke up again.</p><p>This time, everyone was stunned, including Cai Fuhai. He already knew all about the circumstances, but he had never expected Zhu Tianlei to bring up the matter of money at this point.</p><p>"One of my friends once said that when a person makes a mistake, they should bear the corresponding price. Since Boss Yue harbored inappropriate thoughts and did improper things in the past, they should bear the price; otherwise..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't say anything else. He simply glanced at Yue Xiumei, who immediately collapsed to her knees, trembling.</p><p>She was scared!</p><p>Truly terrified!</p><p>Yue Xiumei shakily stood up, walked behind the counter, and tremulously opened a small safe. From inside, she took out 20,000 yuan, which was the store's emergency fund that she and her husband rarely touched.</p><p>"Sir, this 20,000 is what you deserve. This 20,000 is for buying this Dipsacus root from me! Please keep it well!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei put his own 20,000 yuan along with the 20,000 yuan Yue Xiumei handed over into Old Man Yan's hands, then held the broken Dipsacus root and prepared to turn around and leave.</p><p>"Young man, I can't take this money. You..."</p><p>"Sir, this Dipsacus root is of excellent quality; 20,000 yuan is well worth it!"</p><p>With that said, Zhu Tianlei strode through the crowd, quickly disappearing at the elevator entrance.</p><p>Whether this Dipsacus root was truly worth 20,000 yuan was clear to everyone's mind. Therefore, as they watched Zhu Tianlei rush by like a gust of wind, the crowd suddenly erupted into thunderous applause.</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei disappeared from sight, a glint of light appeared in Cai Fuhai's eyes, while Old Man Yan fell into deep thought.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, of course, was unaware of all this. He was busy putting the Dipsacus root into the trunk and preparing to leave.</p><p>Just now, he acted on impulse, but he did gain something. Although outsiders might think that the dodder root was not worth twenty thousand yuan, it was exactly what he needed for the 'Seven-angled Yunxi Capsule' he was currently formulating, which required a dodder root aged over forty years.</p><p>Most importantly, this trip to the ginseng and bird's nest market made him give up on purchasing Chinese herbs from the market. Although he only pointed out the fake medicine incident at Dafa Herbs, it was not an isolated case; the quality of herbs in the entire market was truly poor.</p><p>After returning to Toad Gully, Zhu Tianlei briefly processed the dodder root and then lay down on his bed.</p><p>He unexpectedly fell into a light sleep.</p><p>In his dream, he saw a high mountain shrouded in mist, with thorns covering its slopes. Among these thorns were various rare medicinal herbs.</p><p>At this moment, above the mountain peak, in the mist, a white-clothed elderly man with white hair and youthful features waved at him. Zhu Tianlei felt his body gradually become light and he started to fly.</p><p>Looking down, he felt extremely exhilarated. Just as he was about to fly higher, a strong wind blew, causing him to plummet vertically...</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei screamed in alarm, only to realize it had been a dream.</p><p>However, the dream seemed too real; Zhu Tianlei could clearly remember the feeling of flying in the air.</p><p>Fortunately, it had been just a dream.</p><p>Looking out the window, he saw that the sky was faintly lightening up.</p><p>The wall clock showed 5:32 AM.</p><p>He had slept from late afternoon until dawn?</p><p>He glanced at his phone; apart from messages from Mao Yu and Hao Xinmei, there were no other notifications. He got up and stretched.</p><p>Just now, he acted on impulse, but he did gain something.

Although outsiders might think the dodder root was not worth twenty thousand yuan, it was precisely what he needed for the 'Seven-angled Yunxi Capsule' he was formulating—a rare forty-year-old root.</p><p>Most crucially, his trip to the ginseng and bird's nest market had dissuaded him from purchasing Chinese herbs through such channels. Although he only highlighted the case of fake medicine at Dafa Herbs, it was far from an isolated incident; the overall quality of herbs in the market was abysmal.</p><p>Upon returning to Toad Gully, Zhu Tianlei briefly processed the dodder root before lying down on his bed.</p><p>To his surprise, he drifted off into a light slumber.</p><p>In his dream, he found himself standing at the foot of a mist-shrouded mountain covered with thorns. Amidst these thorns lay an array of rare medicinal herbs.</p><p>Suddenly, above the mountain peak in the mist, an elderly man with white hair and a youthful appearance waved at him. Zhu Tianlei felt his body become light and began to soar upwards.</p><p>Surveying the landscape below, he felt exhilarated. Just as he was about to ascend higher, a strong wind swept through, causing him to plummet vertically...</p><p>"Aaaah!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei screamed in alarm, only to realize it had been a dream.</p><p>The dream felt almost real; Zhu Tianlei could still vividly recall the sensation of flying through the air.</p><p>Fortunately, it had only been a dream.</p><p>Peering out the window, he noticed that dawn was approaching. The wall clock read 5:32 AM. He had slept from late afternoon until sunrise? Glancing at his phone, he saw messages from Mao Yu and Hao Xinmei but no other notifications. He rose from bed and stretched.</p><p>The house was quiet; autumn had already begun, and Zhu Tianlei insisted on spending some money to hire people to help with the harvest. However, Zhu Quezi and Hou Suqin firmly refused with stern faces, causing Zhu Tianlei to give up out of fear of making the two elders unhappy. </p><p>Now, the two should be heading early to the fields to dig out the corn stalks again.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei went to the stove, started rinsing rice, and then began cooking porridge. He took a few eggs from the basket, washed them thoroughly, and threw them into the pot of porridge.</p><p>The crackling fire in the stove flickered red flames before Zhu Tianlei's eyes, slightly dispelling that eerie dream.</p><p>As the fragrance of the cooked rice filled the air, the gate creaked open. Zhu Quezi and Hou Suqin, with their hoes and shovels, walked in.</p><p>During the meal, although it was only a simple porridge and light dishes, Hou Suqin and Zhu Quezi enjoyed them as if they were delicacies from the mountains and seas. They didn't stop until every grain of rice had been scooped out of the pot.</p><p>The peaceful morning brought warmth to the entire family.</p><p>After eating, Zhu Tianlei went to the factory as usual. However, just as he stepped outside the gate, he saw a police car approaching from a distance.</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>Hagoumou was situated deep in the mountains. Although there were some people like Qin Ming who enjoyed secretly watching lonely women bathe, the local morals were generally decent, and criminal activities were rare. Therefore, a police car had never entered Hagoumou since Zhu Tianlei could remember.</p><p>Because of this, behind the police car, a group of early-rising villagers was following from a distance.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stopped in his tracks.</p><p>Sure enough, as he expected, the police car came to an abrupt halt before him with a screech.</p>

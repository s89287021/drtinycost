						<p>Inside the room, bed boards were neatly arranged in a row, with bed numbers written at the head of each. The walls were adorned with the prison’s code of conduct.</p><p>Four people sat on the beds; they were all around thirty years old. The only difference was that three of them had iron chains hanging from their ankles.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei knew what ankle cuffs meant; only death row inmates and serious offenders wore these devices.</p><p>As someone who had been summoned, he could hardly believe he was being housed with death row inmates. No one would take it seriously if he claimed it was not intentional.</p><p>The four men looked up as Zhu Tianlei entered the room.</p><p>"Bro, what did you do?"</p><p>A large man with a scar on his chin spoke first.</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei found a place to sit and told the truth.</p><p>"Hey, brat, Boss Long is asking you a question. What’s your attitude? Do you not want to mix around anymore?"</p><p>Another man wearing ankle cuffs stood up, pointing at Zhu Tianlei and shouting.</p><p>"I don’t know means I don't know."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not wish to engage with these death row inmates; he needed time to figure out who had orchestrated this. Thus, he leaned against the head of his bed, closing his eyes.</p><p>Perhaps due to practicing spiritual medicine techniques, Zhu Tianlei found it increasingly comforting to close his eyes during moments of agitation; it seemed that the world became silent when his eyelids fell.</p><p>"Damn, this kid is awesome!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei’s actions undoubtedly made the others feel ignored.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei closed his eyes and carefully recalled every detail of what had happened, especially the sudden change in attitude of the female police officer; who exactly was on the other end of that phone call?</p><p>Among his enemies, who could possibly have managed to get him into the detention center undetected and arrange for him to share a cell with death row inmates?</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was completely engrossed in these thoughts, he suddenly felt a threatening pressure closing in around him. He quickly lowered his body, twisted his waist, and then thrust upwards, hearing an agonized scream.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei opened his eyes and glared coldly at the person who had been thrown against the wall and then to the ground by his action.</p><p>"Best not to mess with me."</p><p>These words were a warning as well as an offer of retreat.</p><p>"F*ck, still got some spunk in you, but you chose the wrong place to show off. Liu Zi, get him!"</p><p>The man on the ground sneered and then turned to the burliest person standing aside.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>Liu Zi rolled up his sleeves; his muscles were bulging, clearly that of a trained fighter. However, what he did not expect was that before he could even approach Zhu Tianlei, he was punched away by the other man. The cell was small to begin with, and after being punched out, Liu Zi crashed onto the bed frame beside him, flipping it over completely.</p><p>The man who had started speaking earlier, the one with a scar on his chin, stood up, the jingling of his leg irons resounding.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei watched the man’s movements coldly, without uttering a sound.</p><p>The man moved slowly, and when he approached Zhu Tianlei, Zhu Tianlei's heart gave a sharp thump.</p><p>This guy was no pushover!</p><p>When the man stopped half a meter away from Zhu Tianlei, he paused his steps.</p><p>"Kneel!"</p><p>The man spoke slowly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei raised his head to look at the man, who was his toughest opponent after inheriting the divine physician's immortal techniques.</p><p>"Why should I?"</p><p>"This is your reason!"</p><p>The man did not lose any of his momentum compared to Zhu Tianlei. As he spoke, his fists struck like dark clouds descending, and Zhu Tianlei could clearly feel that the air around him was being woven into a large net by the force of the punches, blocking all possible escape routes.</p><p>"Great fist technique!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sincerely praised.</p><p>Although he praised him, if it came to locking Zhu Tianlei down, this man was still not skilled enough. As soon as he finished speaking, Zhu Tianlei bent his right leg, flicked his toe, and a gap appeared in the seemingly impenetrable net.</p><p>The heavy leg irons flew out from the man's body as he moved.</p><p>The other men were so shocked that their jaws nearly dropped.</p><p>In recent years, anyone who had fought with him had suffered a terrible defeat and dare not face him head-on anymore. Even hearing his name made them tremble.</p><p>But now, this legendary figure could barely withstand even one move from the opponent.</p><p>Just as the man was about to crash into the corner of the bed, his body was suddenly intercepted in mid-air. A small rotation brought him back safely.</p><p>The man looked down and immediately saw a one-inch long angle iron protruding from the corner of the bed.</p><p>"Brave!"</p><p>The man praised Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Exaggerating!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei replied coolly, without any trace of arrogance or excitement.</p><p>"Hahaha, I'm Yan Dadao. On the streets, people call me 'Over-the-River Dragon,' and my brothers all call me Brother Dragon!"</p><p>Yan Dadao, the Over-the-River Dragon, was a straightforward person who admitted defeat readily and decisively.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei."</p><p>"Ha ha, great! Tianlei, from now on, you'll be our 309's big brother. All the brothers will rely on your protection!"</p><p>The Over-the-River Dragon did not hesitate to relinquish his position, handing it over generously to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Big Brother, hehe, little brother Ruan Liang, nickname 'Fathead Fish.' I offended Big Brother just now; I hope Big Brother won't hold a grudge against me!"</p><p>The man who had initially ordered Zhu Tianlei around and seemed intent on reprimanding him came forward. He looked like an old fox, cowardly towards the strong and aggressive towards the weak.</p><p>The others also called Zhu Tianlei their big brother and introduced themselves one by one.</p><p>"I'll be out in at most a day!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke with certainty.</p><p>However, it was clear that the others did not share this belief.</p><p>"Tianlei, although I don't know exactly why you ended up here, everyone in 309 is a death row inmate. The lightest sentence even for the smallest cell is life imprisonment, so we all call 309 the gateway to hell. Once you're in, you can't get out."</p><p>Yan Datou's personality was something Tianlei really liked; he was straightforward and honest. Yan Datou's expression improved.</p><p>"I don't know why I'm here either, but I must have been framed!"</p><p>"Were you also a gangster before?"</p><p>This was Yan Datou's first reaction. As they say, your perspective is shaped by your experience, and your environment influences your thinking. Being a gangster himself, Yan Datou naturally assumed Tianlei was the same.</p><p>"I'm a doctor."</p>

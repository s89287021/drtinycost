						<p>Although he usually interacted more with Zhang Qiang and knew that this young man was quiet and did everything alone, Zhu Tianlei still had a good impression of him because he worked diligently and reliably. Such a person didn't seem to be someone severely physically compromised.</p><p>"Captain Qi, if we treat Zhang Qiang's illness according to the normal procedures, I will cover all the costs!"</p><p>Captain Qi looked at Zhu Tianlei, nodding frequently. What young man could fail to impress him?</p><p>"Captain Qi, I am an enterprise consultant for Tianlei Pharmaceutical. This incident is our oversight and highlights a flaw in our management. We will cover all treatment fees, medication expenses, as well as post-treatment nutrition costs and loss-of-work compensation during the worker's hospitalization period."</p><p>Captain Qi looked at Mao Yu, then at Zhu Tianlei. Indeed, what kind of leader leads what kind of soldiers; what kind of boss has what kind of employees.</p><p>"Little Zhu, come out for a moment!"</p><p>Qi Lian thought for a moment and told Zhu Tianlei. Zhu Tianlei glanced at Mao Yu, who nodded understandingly. It was only then that Zhu Tianlei followed Qi Lian out of the ward.</p><p>Outside the ward, Qi Lian did not stop but looked around before pointing to the nearby smoking area.</p><p>Once they reached the smoking area, Qi Lian said seriously,</p><p>"Little Zhu, did you offend someone?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was startled. What did Captain Qi mean?</p><p>"What Captain Qi means is..."</p><p>"I believe there's a significant possibility of retaliation behind the report against you. Technically, this shouldn't come from my mouth, but I, Qi Lian, admire your character very much, so I am breaking protocol to tell you about it."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was slightly moved.</p><p>"Captain Qi, to be frank, I have long suspected that someone has been secretly plotting this. However, regardless of the cause, Zhang Qiang's health is indeed a serious issue. Whether it is due to my actions or not, I bear the responsibility. Thank you, Captain Qi!"</p><p>Qi Lian patted Zhu Tianlei on the shoulder, nodding with great satisfaction. He had not misjudged him.</p><p>When Qian Lian finally left, Zhu Tianlei reached up and took a small piece of paper from his shoulder. On it was a string of phone numbers. Zhu Tianlei had seen this phone number not long ago; as his spiritual medical skills improved, so did his memory, though he could hardly claim to have an eidetic memory. Still, whatever he saw tended to leave a deep impression in his mind.</p><p>Zhang Qiang woke up around two-thirty in the afternoon. The first thing he did was look for a phone. "Where is my phone? Where is it?"</p><p>Zhang Qiang's legs were wrapped in plaster that had yet to fully set, and any movement could easily cause it to fall off. The nurse beside him, already distressed, pleaded with Zhang Qiang but couldn't stop him.</p><p>Just then, Zhu Tianlei walked in from outside and pressed down on Zhang Qiang's shoulder. The frenzied movements of Zhang Qiang immediately ceased.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, let me go!"</p><p>Zhang Qiang's eyes were wide open and bloodshot, looking more like a demon that had just crawled out of hell than a patient.</p><p>"Zhang Qiang, calm down!" Zhu Tianlei shouted.</p><p>Whether out of fear of Zhu Tianlei's stern demeanor or for some other reason, Zhang Qiang lowered his head and stopped struggling.</p><p>Soon after, the doctor and Qian Lian arrived in response to the news. Due to Zhang Qiang's weakened state, he had been receiving nutrition through an IV since he was admitted. The struggle earlier caused blood from the needle tube to mix with the medication, but Zhang Qiang seemed oblivious to it all.</p><p>"Zhang Qiang, I am Inspector Qian Lian of the Administration for Industry and Commerce. This is Chief Wu from the Labor Bureau. We received a report stating that Tianlei Pharmaceutical was engaged in irregular construction practices, forcing workers to perform high-pressure operations. What do you think about this? We would like to hear your opinion."</p><p>Given such an issue, it was inevitable that the Labor Bureau would get involved.</p><p>With the recent promulgation and implementation of the new Labor Law, the relationship between employers and employees had both improved and deteriorated. Workers knew how to use legal weapons to protect their rights, and labor arbitration had become a top-level search keyword on the internet.</p><p>Zhang Qiang looked at Zhu Tianlei and then at Inspector Qian Lian and Chief Wu of the Labor Bureau standing beside him. He nodded his head.</p><p>"Yes, during the construction process at Tianlei Pharmaceutical, we often worked overtime and sometimes skipped breaks to meet deadlines. I have been feeling dizzy and unsteady lately, even finding it difficult to stand."</p><p>Zhang Qiang finished speaking, and Qi Lian's face immediately turned grim. He sincerely did not want Zhu Tianlei to get into trouble, but regardless of whether the whistleblower was deliberately framing him or not, Zhang Qiang's testimony could not be ignored; Zhu Tianlei's troubles were inevitable.</p><p>"Then please provide more details about how many times you worked overtime and who participated in those shifts. We need this specific information for our further investigation."</p><p>Director Wu spoke with a professional tone. Qi Lian did not interrupt; the initial seizure of the construction site was within his duty, but now it fell under the jurisdiction of the Labor Bureau.</p><p>"There were too many instances to count. As for who participated in the overtime, just ask around on-site; everyone knows."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Zhang Qiang without saying a word. He was curious about what else Zhang Qiang could reveal.</p><p>"Who was the doctor who examined and treated Zhang Qiang first?"</p><p>Soon, Doctor Yang walked in, repeating almost the same statement as before but adding one final remark.</p><p>"When examining the patient, I found silver needles inserted into his body, clearly an attempt to conceal the condition. I hope this information is helpful to you."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stared at Doctor Yang, who seemed in good spirits, his gaze unaltered and completely normal.</p><p>While Zhu Tianlei had initially only suspected Doctor Yang, he was now certain that the doctor had been bribed. And what about Zhang Qiang?</p><p>"Good, the information you provided is crucial. Thank you!"</p><p>Director Wu put away her recorder and thanked Doctor Yang.</p><p>"Captain Qi, we have gathered all the necessary details. I still need to compile this information into a complete chain of evidence. You may be needed again later. In the meantime, please oversee the closure and supervision of the construction site!"</p><p>"That's my duty!"</p><p>Director Wu did not question Zhu Tianlei further but left directly.</p><p>The people in the ward quickly dispersed. After a day of commotion, Qi Lian gave Zhu Tianlei some instructions and left with his subordinates.</p><p>Mao Yu had also gone to Hama Gou to handle the aftermath and was not present.</p><p>As night fell, the light in the ward dimmed. Zhu Tianlei sat on a nearby bed, watching the medication drip from Zhang Qiang's IV bottle drop by drop. Zhang Qiang appeared somewhat restless and repeatedly asked the nursing staff about the status of his phone.</p><p>"Do you want to make a call?"</p>

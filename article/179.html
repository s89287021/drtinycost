						<p>Zhu Tianlei stood downstairs, stretching out his arms and catching Jiang Haitao's body the moment he fell.</p><p>On the sixth-floor rooftop, at a height of nearly twenty meters, Jiang Haitao, who was 1.78 meters tall and weighed 100 kilograms, looked at Jiang Haitao lying in Zhu Tianlei's arms, and everyone had their mouths wide open.</p><p>Inside the quarantine zone and outside it, hundreds of onlookers stood in silence, as if they were in a dead sea.</p><p>Jiang Haitao raised his head with a blank stare.</p><p>Shouldn't he have been reduced to smithereens from the fall?</p><p>What was going on now? How could he be in Zhu Tianlei's arms?</p><p>This scene unfolded too quickly for anyone to comprehend what had happened.</p><p>Li Ping was the most shocked.</p><p>He was certain that before Jiang Haitao fell, Zhu Tianlei had been standing behind him.</p><p>"Doctor... Doctor Zhu..."</p><p>Once his initial shock subsided, Jiang Haitao reverted to being the timid man he was before. He looked at Zhu Tianlei's cold gaze and whispered softly.</p><p>He clearly knew what he had just said. Although he knew that Zhu Tianlei would not do anything to Wu Xiaohui, who was obviously a man-seducer, he could not control himself at the moment. He wanted to vent his feelings.</p><p>He wanted to let people know before he died that he also had some courage.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked coldly at Jiang Haitao and released him, causing him to fall to the ground.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not speak; instead, he turned around and left in large strides.</p><p>"Great, Doctor Zhu is amazing!"</p><p>"Long live Doctor Zhu! Long live!"</p><p>By the time everyone came to their senses, a young nurse's eyes filled with admiration as she was the first to cheer loudly. Soon, the cheers echoed together like a wave rolling through the mountains and valleys, so loud it seemed to shake the sky.</p><p>Xue Ping couldn't help but turn around and realize that this young man had somehow grown much taller, almost as if he were surrounded by a faint golden halo.</p><p>In the president's office, Tang Wen was looking at his phone, watching the video spreading wildly on social media. Zhu Tianlei moved faster than lightning, and such a person was easy to become fanatically adored, of course also easy to make one feel cautious. Tang Wen belonged to the latter category.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's almost miraculous act of bravery spread as a legend in the isolation area within a short time.</p><p>And as the main character of this incident, Jiang Haitao only started feeling truly down after he was saved.</p><p>Although no one abused him, his gaze now seemed different from before. He was very sensitive and knew why he was being treated that way, but there was no such thing as a regret pill in this world.</p><p>Now he had lost the courage to commit suicide and instead recalled many beautiful memories from the past. If he had succeeded in committing suicide during the day, then he would have never had the chance to experience those joys again.</p><p>And yet, he actually said such things to his savior; no wonder his wife left him. Perhaps what she cared about wasn't LV (Louis Vuitton). When they were together, he was also penniless, but the two of them lived very happily.</p><p>It seemed that after experiencing life and death, one suddenly understood many things.</p><p>Jiang Haitao hesitated for a moment before getting up and heading towards Doctor Zhu's office.</p><p>As he passed by an office, he heard people talking inside. At first, he didn't want to listen carefully, but when he heard the name 'Zhu Tianlei', he involuntarily stopped in his tracks.</p><p>Inside the office, Zhu Tianlei had his feet propped on the table and his brows furrowed.</p><p>He had just watched the news; this epidemic had already caused 1031 deaths, and the number was increasing rapidly. Among those who died, more than 70 were medical workers.</p><p>The National Disease Control Center and the Ministry of Health had issued a medical aid request to the international community, but so far, no country had responded.</p><p>Although he was very confident in the medication this time, his heart remained uneasy until he confirmed its effectiveness.</p><p>At that moment, the door was knocked, and Jiang Haitao walked in.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, thank you for saving me."</p><p>Jiang Haitao mustered up great courage. He was not a child; since he did not want to live aimlessly after having died once, he had to learn to change himself, starting with admitting his mistakes.</p><p>"I don't deserve it."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's tone was filled with coldness.</p><p>He was not angry at Jiang Haitao for being ungrateful. He was angry at Jiang Haitao's self-destructive attitude. He did not realize that the quarantine zone was fragile like a thin veil, and just a little force could scatter the people's morale within it.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, I know I made a mistake, but as the saying goes, get up where you fell down. I absolutely won't make the same mistake again."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Jiang Haitao before him.</p><p>By age, Jiang Haitao was nine years older than him, making him like an elder brother. But in front of Zhu Tianlei, Jiang Haitao seemed like a child, especially now, with his head lowered and eagerly waiting for Zhu Tianlei to speak.</p><p>"Forget it. In at most one month, you can walk out of the quarantine zone healthy. I hope you truly understand where you went wrong, not all mistakes can be corrected in time."</p><p>"Yes, I'm looking forward to that day!"</p><p>Jiang Haitao looked at Zhu Tianlei with determination.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was not only his savior but also gave him the courage to continue living, saving his aimless soul.</p><p>Life is so fragile. How many people are tortured by illnesses and still smile at life despite their suffering, giving their days value even if they live for just one more day?</p><p>Yet how many others moan about being sick, unable to withstand any setbacks or blows, choosing suicide over living for trivial reasons, without a care for those who are alive.</p><p>Watching Jiang Haitao straighten his back and walk out of the door, Zhu Tianlei sighed softly.</p><p>Because there was anticipation, everyone slept restlessly that night.</p><p>The next morning, as soon as it was light, Zhu Tianlei rushed to Kung Shengbin's ward. When he saw Kung Shengbin sitting on his bed reading a book with rosy cheeks, his heart dropped into his stomach.</p><p>The most severe phase of this infectious disease occurred in the morning.</p><p>Each morning, the isolation area was at its busiest, and thus breakfast time was divided into several segments to accommodate patients.</p><p>Kung Shengbin raised his head, seeing Zhu Tianlei standing by the door, and broke into a smile.</p><p>The smiles of the elderly man and young boy became a delicate flower in this day akin to winter.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei informed the main medical staff about the effects of the medication. Everyone was so excited that they could hardly contain themselves.</p><p>Xue Ping and Shen Haifeng volunteered to take on Zhu Tianlei's assistant role.</p><p>A new drug procurement order was drafted and sent to Tang Wen.</p><p>Tang Wen managed all volunteer work in the isolation area, from start to finish. As a logistics director, he had performed well, promptly addressing all needs within the isolation zone. Therefore, Zhu Tianlei had a good impression of him.</p><p>Sure enough, one day later, a small truck loaded with traditional Chinese medicinal herbs arrived outside the isolation area.</p>

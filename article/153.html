						<p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, the old man raised his head. Whether it was due to Zhu Tianlei's concern as a stranger or something else he thought of, the old man's turbid eyes suddenly filled with tears.</p><p>"Sir, if you have any trouble, you can tell me. I can help you solve it."</p><p>The old man's tears made Zhu Tianlei feel a bit oppressed, and he couldn't help but recall the days when his father was hit by a boulder on his thigh and could not get out of bed. Many times, he saw his father secretly wiping away tears behind him and his mother.</p><p>A real man doesn't shed tears easily, let alone an elderly person over sixty years old.</p><p>"Good child, you can't help me. Sir, thank you anyway!"</p><p>The old man wiped away his tears, and his emotions seemed to have improved slightly. With hands full of wrinkles, he gently patted Zhu Tianlei's shoulder and said in a hoarse voice.</p><p>"Sir, just tell me what it is. This matter, I will definitely help until the end. I am capable."</p><p>The old man widened his eyes and examined Zhu Tianlei from head to toe, shaking his head.</p><p>This young man looks about as old as my grandson. His heart is good, but he can't push this child into a pit. That Yue Xiumei is like a tigress; I was bitten by the tiger myself and cannot drag others down.</p><p>"Good child, really, it's not needed. I'm leaving!"</p><p>Seeing the old man about to leave, Zhu Tianlei quickly stepped in front of him.</p><p>"Sir, you don't need to fear causing me trouble. Since I told you this, it proves that I have the ability."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said with certainty.</p><p>The old man looked at Zhu Tianlei again and saw his stern expression, no trace of recklessness. After hesitating for a while, he briefly recounted what had happened to him to Zhu Tianlei. By the end, his eyes were blurred again.</p><p>"Sir, I understand. Don't worry, I will definitely get the medicinal herbs back for you, and I'll double them!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei listened with his heart filled with indignation.</p><p>This matter, he was determined to take care of.</p><p>"Is the boss here?"</p><p>At Dafa Medicine Shop, Zhu Tianlei stood in front of the medicine cabinet and asked solemnly.</p><p>When Yue Xiumei heard the voice, she rushed out from behind the small storeroom. Seeing Zhu Tianlei standing in front of the medicine cabinet, she was slightly stunned.</p><p>Due to the special nature of this industry, most people who came for transactions were generally older. Few were as young as Zhu Tianlei, but Yue Xiumei had grown up helping her parents with their business and knew a lot about human relations and social norms.</p><p>At first glance, she could tell that the clothes Zhu Tianlei was wearing were quite expensive, possibly making him a member of the wealthy second generation. If he turned out to be someone naive who didn't know much about the business, it would be even better for her to make money.</p><p>Thinking of this, Yue Xiumei's face had a sickly sweet smile that could turn some people's stomachs.</p><p>"Hey, little brother, buying medicine?"</p><p>"Yes, I want to buy some medicine."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei lowered his head and used his fingers to pinch a few times at the Astragalus in the bag, which confirmed Yue Xiumei's previous guess—indeed, he was inexperienced.</p><p>"Sure thing, little brother. Tell Sister anything you want to buy; aside from boasting, the goods in Sister's shop are the most comprehensive in this industry, and the prices are the fairest. Just look around; Sister guarantees you'll get a good deal."</p><p>"Sister, to be honest, after looking around, it seems that I can't find what I'm looking for..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei scanned the room with his eyes, revealing some disappointment on his face, and then he was about to leave.</p><p>How could Yue Xiumei let such an opportunity slip away? She hurriedly stood in front of Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Little brother, take a look at you. Just tell Sister what you want; don't take it as boasting, if Sister's shop can't find something, no one else will either."</p><p>Yue Xiumei pounded her chest and guaranteed, "This... Sister, to be frank, I want to buy some Dipsacus asperosus roots, preferably ones that are over twenty years old..."</p><p>Yue Xiumei rolled her eyes and suddenly thumped her thigh.</p><p>"Haha, little brother, if you look at your face, it looks like you're destined for good fortune. Sister just happened to receive one, thirty-five years old, pure wild-grown, excellent quality, as smooth as a two-year-old's skin..."</p><p>Yue Xiumei knew well how to sell her products; saying this would spark the customer's interest. Once they were interested, it would be easier to negotiate the price.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's eyes lit up with extreme delight as he looked at Yue Xiumei.</p><p>"Really? That's great, Sister, I'll take it!"</p><p>Yue Xiumei felt secretly pleased but displayed a slightly embarrassed look on her face.</p><p>"Little brother, to be frank, when Sister bought this Dipsacus asperosus root, she paid a hefty price. Several old customers also showed interest in it, ah..."</p><p>"The price is negotiable. As long as the quality of the Dipsacus asperosus is good, the price isn't an issue. If those people are willing to pay X amount, I'll add thirty percent."</p><p>"Alright, alright, little brother, you're a man of honor. Wait here, Sister will bring it out for you!"</p><p>Yue Xiumei was overjoyed.</p><p>He really is naive, adding thirty percent—what's the base price if not up to me?</p><p>Watching Yue Xiumei rush into the small door at the back of the counter, Zhu Tianlei sneered.</p><p>A moment later, Yue Xiumei emerged with a huge wooden box.</p><p>"Big brother, come see, this quality is guaranteed to satisfy you!"</p><p>Yue Xiumei placed the large box on the counter. The moment she opened the lid, she couldn't wait to brag to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei cooperated by lowering his head as if he was looking at something carefully.</p><p>At that moment, an old man with a slender build walked in from outside and immediately approached Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"This is mine. You still don't admit it? It's you who took my stuff......."</p><p>Yue Xiumei watched the returning old man and her face instantly turned ugly, but since Zhu Tianlei was right in front of her, she didn't dare to be too direct.</p><p>"Old Yan, look at yourself, are your wits failing again? Go home quickly, don't cause trouble!"</p><p>"You're the one with bad wits. This stuff is mine, you took my things......."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei lifted his head, full of suspicion.</p><p>"Sis, this......"</p><p>Yue Xiumei was very irritated but still had to force a smile.</p><p>"This old man's name is Yan, he's not too sharp in the head and often wanders around our neighborhood. Ignore him......"</p><p>"Oh!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's oh stretched on for a long time, making Yue Xiumei jump with fright. Fortunately, Zhu Tianlei didn't say anything more afterward, but she knew that Old Yan's existence was like a time bomb, ready to explode at any moment and ruin everything.</p><p>"Old Yan, hurry up and go, if you don't leave I'll tell the law enforcement about your shed construction......"</p><p>Yue Xiumei smiled on the surface but threatened him fiercely as she approached Old Yan.</p><p>Old Yan shivered, instinctively wanting to retreat.</p>

						<p>He held the little infant above his head and then forcefully slammed it to the ground. He heard the child's cries, but he did not feel cruel; instead, he felt an overwhelming sense of satisfaction. Seeing Zheng Xiuxiu sobbing uncontrollably while holding the child, he felt that his heart had finally found peace. Then, he grabbed Lu Kang and used him to force Zheng Xiuxiu to take the child's corpse and slander Zhu Tianlei, who had revived Ge Tianheng and disrupted his plan for domination in the underworld.</p><p>He was lost in the joy of revenge, but now he felt dizzy as if countless voices were echoing in his head. He began to notice that the little infant's eyes resembled his own, as did its mouth; even the way it sucked on its thumb mirrored him perfectly. </p><p>He had killed his own daughter with his own hands! Qin Zhuang had killed his only flesh and blood! This was not a joke or a lie—it was true!</p><p>"Ha ha ha....... Ha ha ha......."</p><p>Qin Zhuang suddenly burst into a laughter that sounded harsh, making people shudder.</p><p>Everyone stared at Black Eagle Society's Big Brother Qin Zhuang, whose face was battered but who still laughed heaven-shakingly. They came to a consensus: Qin Zhuang had gone mad!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei retracted his hand.</p><p>What was done by Heaven could be forgiven; what one did to oneself could not be pardoned. Compared to death, this was the best punishment for Qin Zhuang.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei gave a cold glance at the stunned crowd and then turned and left.</p><p>Everyone heaved a sigh of relief but forgot to swallow it when Zhu Tianlei turned back.</p><p>"If any of you dare to commit evil again, this will be your fate."</p><p>His words were brief and powerful, like an engraving that deeply carved into everyone's heart.</p><p>A lone individual ventures into the tiger's den, entering with courage and leaving with serenity.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you saved Xiu Xiu and Dou Ya back then, and today you saved me. This favor I owe to Lu Kang..."</p><p>After exiting the villa, Lu Kang said to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"It doesn't matter. I also did it for that child."</p><p>What Zhu Tianlei said was not a lie; he had indeed come with Zheng Xiuxiu despite knowing it was a trap, largely because he wanted to uncover the truth about the little infant's death.</p><p>Now, Qin Zang is insane, and the deceased Dou Ya can finally rest in peace.</p><p>"What are your plans?"</p><p>Pulling back his thoughts, Zhu Tianlei looked at Lu Kang, who was covered in blood and appeared disheveled.</p><p>"I don't know. Let's take it one step at a time!"</p><p>Zheng Xiuxiu clung to Lu Kang, having shed the toughness and sensitivity of her delivery day, resembling a delicate young girl.</p><p>"If you're not opposed, you can temporarily stay with me back at the company. If your arm doesn't get fixed soon, it might be useless forever, along with all your injuries..."</p><p>Lu Kang looked at Zhu Tianlei in disbelief.</p><p>"What, unwilling?"</p><p>"Willing, we are willing!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned around, a faint smile barely visible on his face.</p><p>Facing Zheng Xiuxiu who had returned with Zhu Tianlei, none of the employees of Tian Lei Pharmaceuticals had a good expression.</p><p>On that day, everyone saw the live stream. This woman was simply wicked; if not for our chairman's quick thinking and decisive action, Tianlei Pharmaceutical might have gone bankrupt. Now, this person actually dared to walk into the company so boldly, it was as if inviting a beating.</p><p>"You two can stay here temporarily. Don't take what others say to heart; things will get better over time!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei wasn't good at comforting people, and this sentence was already his limit.</p><p>"Tianlei, when someone makes a mistake, they should take responsibility for it. I understand that. If it were me, I might react even more strongly than everyone else. We empathize."</p><p>Lu Kang shed the rough demeanor he usually had and suddenly seemed more innocent.</p><p>"That's good. Here is the medicine I prepared; take it first. I'll come back later to treat your bones."</p><p>Watching Zhu Tianlei disappear into the distance.</p><p>Lu Kang hugged Zheng Xiuxiu's slender shoulders, both of their eyes filled with faint tears and a joy of having been reborn.</p><p>After dinner, Zhu Tianlei brought his newly prepared medicine to treat Lu Kang's broken bones and other injuries. By the time he was done, it was already high noon.</p><p>The events of that day made him feel somewhat complex and heavy-hearted, so he took advantage of the moonlight and slowly walked towards Liang Xia.</p><p>From a distance, he saw a slender figure under the willow tree at the intersection.</p><p>"Lanlan?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei quickly went over. Ma Lanlan had just washed her hair, which was still wet and draped over her shoulders, filling the air with the scent of shampoo.</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei, Ma Lanlan's eyes immediately turned red, and large tears rolled down her cheeks.</p><p>"Lanlan, what's wrong?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was startled.</p><p>He put a hand on Ma Lanlan's shoulder, wiping away her tears gently with his heart filled with sorrow. </p><p>Ma Lanlan threw herself into Zhu Tianlei's arms and began to sob loudly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was flustered by Ma Lanlan's crying; he didn't know what could make this little temperamental girl cry like this.</p><p>However, before Zhu Tianlei could ask her, Ma Lanlan grabbed his hand tightly. No matter how Zhu Tianlei questioned her, she remained silent and just pulled him forward.</p><p>In the end, the two of them found themselves standing in front of the village clinic's door.</p><p>"Lanlan....."</p><p>"Don't say anything."</p><p>Ma Lanlan stopped Zhu Tianlei from speaking, taking out a key to open the clinic door.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was utterly confused as Ma Lanlan dragged him into the clinic. Then she closed and locked the door behind them.</p><p>Although the moonlight outside was bright, the clinic inside remained dimly lit.</p><p>Without a word, Ma Lanlan pulled Zhu Tianlei onto the examination table, drew up the curtain, and then began to take off her coat.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was startled, touching Ma Lanlan's wrist quickly.</p><p>Her body seemed normal; there were no abnormalities!</p><p>"Lanlan, Lanlan..... wait......"</p><p>As he watched Ma Lanlan start to take off her shirt, Zhu Tianlei hurriedly spoke up.</p><p>But Ma Lanlan ignored him and quickly removed her pure white shirt. A snow-white peak emerged from her light purple undershirt.</p><p>He gently placed a hand on Ma Lanlan's shoulder, wiping away her tears with his heart filled with sorrow.</p><p>Ma Lanlan threw herself into Zhu Tianlei's arms, sobbing loudly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was flustered by Ma Lanlan's crying; he couldn't understand what had made this fiery girl cry so bitterly.</p><p>Before he could ask, Ma Lanlan grabbed his hand tightly. No matter how Zhu Tianlei tried to question her, she remained silent and simply pulled him forward.</p><p>To their surprise, they ended up in front of the village clinic.</p><p>"Lanlan....."</p><p>"Don't say anything."</p><p>Ma Lanlan stopped Zhu Tianlei from speaking, taking out a key to open the door of the clinic.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was utterly confused as Ma Lanlan dragged him inside. She then closed and locked the door behind them.</p><p>Though the moonlight outside was bright, the clinic was dimly lit.</p><p>Without a word, Ma Lanlan led Zhu Tianlei to an examination table, drew up the curtain, and began to remove her coat.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was startled, quickly checking her wrist.</p><p>Her body seemed normal; there were no abnormalities!</p><p>"Lanlan, Lanlan..... wait......"</p><p>As he watched Ma Lanlan start to take off her shirt, Zhu Tianlei urgently spoke up.</p><p>But Ma Lanlan ignored him and swiftly removed her pure white shirt. A snow-white peak emerged from her light purple undershirt.</p><p>He gently placed a hand on Ma Lanlan's shoulder, wiping away her tears with his heart filled with sorrow.</p><p>Ma Lanlan threw herself into Zhu Tianlei's arms, sobbing loudly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was flustered by Ma Lanlan's cries; he couldn't comprehend what had made this fiery girl burst into tears.</p><p>Before he could ask, Ma Lanlan grabbed his hand tightly. No matter how Zhu Tianlei tried to question her, she remained silent and simply pulled him forward.</p><p>To their surprise, they ended up in front of the village clinic.</p><p>"Lanlan....."</p><p>"Don't say anything."</p><p>Ma Lanlan stopped Zhu Tianlei from speaking, taking out a key to open the door of the clinic.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was utterly confused as Ma Lanlan dragged him inside.

A snow-white peak emerged from her light purple undershirt.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's breathing instantly became heavy.</p><p>No one knew how much Ma Lanlan longed for him, but the current situation was just too bizarre.</p><p>"Lanlan, listen to me first. What happened......"</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, I want to become your person."</p><p>"You already are my person!"</p><p>"I want to make you pregnant, right now, immediately, at once."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was momentarily stunned by Ma Lanlan's words.</p><p>What is this about?</p><p>It sounded like......like he was forcing someone into prostitution.</p><p>But before Zhu Tianlei could respond, Ma Lanlan's light purple lingerie fell off her body.</p><p>The mountain peaks trembled with the night, and red plum blossoms bloomed under the moonlight.</p><p>Ma Lanlan moved again, her half skirt sliding to the ground, followed by the final barrier falling away.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's eyes, head, and breathing were like a firepile doused with gasoline, flames leaping up immediately.</p>

						<p>"Aiyaya, Leizi, I never thought my son would really have medical skills. Who knows, maybe he's the reincarnation of Hua Tuo! Woman, you haven't heard? Hu Daniu is already dead, but our son revived him with just a few touches. The ancestral grave of the Old Zhu family is smoking today!"</p><p>Zhu Quezi was so excited that he couldn't control himself; Hou Suxin was also crying, her tears falling in rapid succession. Zhu Tianlei rolled his eyes, it seemed he had passed this test.</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei let out a breath, his gaze fell on his father's disabled right leg.</p><p>Zhu Quezi's leg was injured twelve years ago when a large rock fell from the mountain while he was collecting stones. However, due to their poverty at that time and lack of money to go to the city hospital, they could only get some pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory medication from a small clinic in the village.</p><p>Before the injury healed, there was a flood. Zhu Quezi, caring for his old sow in the pigsty, braved the rain to drive her onto the hilltop. As a result, not only did the old sow drown, but Zhu Quezi's leg was completely paralyzed.</p><p>A fine young man turned into one who hobbled ever after, unable to do any heavy labor and enduring countless white eyes.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt somewhat excited; now that he had medical skills, could he cure his father's leg?</p><p>"Dad, let me take a look at your leg!"</p><p>Zhu Quezi was stunned, seemingly not fully understanding his son's words.</p><p>"Father, our son has medical skills now. He even revived someone who was on the brink of death! Your leg might just get better!"</p><p>Zhu Quezi still didn't move; he wasn't as optimistic as his wife. His leg hadn't been newly injured; it had been an old injury for over a decade, and the bone fragments were probably misaligned by now. It couldn't be cured so easily.</p><p>"Dad, let me take a look, right? Even if I can't cure it, I won't make it worse, will I?"</p><p>"Foolish child, could your father fear you making it worse? My son is a divine doctor; what my father fears... forget it, forget it. Father believes in you!"</p><p>Zhu Quezi swallowed half of his words without saying them out loud, while both Zhu Tianlei and Hou Suxin knew exactly what he had left unsaid: the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei placed his father's leg on his own. For over a decade, he had never looked at this injured leg of his father so closely.</p><p>The calf, which should have been in line with the thigh, hung down at an extremely strange and eerie angle.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's eyes were slightly hot. For twelve years, his father had been limping with one leg, tending to the six mu of land at home and supporting himself. It was only now that Zhu Tianlei truly experienced the bitterness of it all.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took out a small cloth bag from his pocket. This cloth bag was what he just found in a cabinet in his room. He had seen this thing before when he was young, but he didn't know what it was. Now, he clearly knew that these were silver needles, and they looked rather old.</p><p>Before he could ask how his family came to have such an item, it was put to use right away.</p><p>"Dad, it might hurt a little at first, and there will be some numbness. If you can't bear it, make a sound!"</p><p>Zhu Quezi smiled simply and humbly without speaking, indicating that he agreed with his son.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei placed his right hand under Zhu Quezi's knee, generously allowing the spirit energy in his body to flow into his father's body slowly.</p><p>Zhu Quezi felt his previously numb and stiff leg suddenly warm up. It seemed like a hot current was spreading from his knee, gradually reaching every part of his body. This feeling was tens of times more comfortable than eating dumplings on New Year's Eve or lying on a heated bed watching the Spring Festival Gala.</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Quezi suddenly felt that he had never been so close to hope before.</p><p>Feeling the sensation returned from his palm, Zhu Tianlei retracted his hand and pulled out the silver needle from the cloth bag. Compared to sewing needles, the silver needle was light as fog and fine as hair, but it felt like a thousand catties in Zhu Tianlei's hand.</p><p>He took a deep breath, and the silver needle pierced into Zhu Quezi's Stomach 3 Mile point. Zhu Quezi let out a light groan.</p><p>"It's okay, Lei'er, keep going!"</p><p>Zhu Quezi felt slightly regretful; he shouldn't have given in to pain as it would only put pressure on his son!</p><p>Hou Suqin watched nervously with her hands full of old calluses tightly clenched together.</p><p>"Lei'er, my leg....."</p><p>As soon as Zhu Tianlei finished inserting the needles, Zhu Quezi let out a scream, his eyes wide open in extreme shock.</p><p>"Dad, what's wrong with you?"</p><p>Hou Suqin had already been nervous, and seeing Zhu Qiezi's reaction made her eyes well up with tears. Zhu Tianlei's body also stiffened.</p><p>"Lei, look at Dad's leg..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei and Hou Suqin lowered their heads together, only to see Zhu Qiezi's originally twisted, wooden-like stiff leg start to move lightly, then increasingly larger in amplitude.</p><p>A tear fell from the corner of Zhu Tianlei's eye without warning.</p><p>Perhaps for doctors, saving lives and healing injuries is a great love, but being able to make one's loved ones happy through it is truly awe-inspiring.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei softly calmed down his agitated parents and repeatedly reminded Zhu Qiezi not to walk for now. He needed to administer two more injections to ensure Zhu Qiezi's leg would fully recover.</p><p>After giving these instructions, Zhu Tianlei sauntered out of the courtyard.</p><p>Staring at the distant green Phoenix Mountain, where the Gourd Cave was located, he got lost in thought.</p><p>The events that had occurred in the cave came flooding back to his mind. Perhaps there were still other secrets hidden in the Gourd Cave.</p><p>Thinking about this, Zhu Tianlei said hello to Hou Suqin and headed towards Phoenix Mountain.</p><p>Since waking up in the mountain cave, Zhu Tianlei's physical condition had improved remarkably. Even his walking was light and swift; it didn't take him more than ten minutes to reach the entrance of the Gourd Cave.</p><p>Thinking about what had happened over the past two days, Zhu Tianlei felt as if he were living in a dream. He took a deep breath and stepped back into the Gourd Cave.</p><p>There hadn't been any changes inside the cave. Zhu Tianlei slowly walked to the spot where he had fainted, still able to faintly see some splattered bloodstains on the ground.</p><p>However, the stone that Chen Guafu had used as a weapon was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was puzzled. He looked around, but it was truly gone. With the matter resolved and the stone no longer valuable, why would it disappear?</p><p>Could it be...</p><p>Did my blood trigger some mechanism?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei thought to himself as he wandered around the gourd cave.</p><p>The gourd cave was a natural cavern, warm in winter and cool in summer. Although it was sweltering outside at that moment, the inside of the cave was extremely refreshing. Zhu Tianlei decided to sit on a large rock.</p><p>He calmed his mind, carefully recalling the meditation principles mentioned in the Spirit Doctor’s Art, closed his eyes, and directed his breath to his dantian.</p><p>Gradually, he actually felt a warm energy ball forming at the location of his dantian. The energy ball transformed from intangible to tangible, as if the entire body became ethereal because of this energy ball.</p><p>Before he knew it, three hours had passed.</p>

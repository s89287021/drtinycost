						<p>Zhu Tianlei greeted Yang Wenjie and then sped off in his van.</p><p>The blades in Xiao Gang’s throat felt like they were cutting into his heart.</p><p>Zhou Qiang, Zhou Qiang....</p><p>Throughout the journey, Zhu Tianlei silently repeated Zhou Qiang’s name countless times in his mind.</p><p>Ma Jia Hutong was located in the shantytown area of Yunhai City. Due to the city's rapid development, the area of this shantytown had become smaller and smaller, while the population density there had increased dramatically.</p><p>Migrant workers who could not afford apartments chose to rent houses here.</p><p>The residents of these shantytowns were very smart; they would divide a small courtyard into several parts. The money from renting one courtyard eventually turned into four, five, or even more rents.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei’s van came to a stop at the intersection of the shantytown.</p><p>Water accumulated on the ground everywhere, and garbage piles were lined up one after another.</p><p>A few people stood outside the public restroom, smoking and chatting loudly.</p><p>The narrow alleys crisscrossed each other, and all the houses were from the late 1980s to early 1990s. Although some renovations had been done later on, the signs of age could still be seen.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei got out of the van and walked towards a small house next to the public restroom. The few people smoking looked at Zhu Tianlei simultaneously.</p><p>After all, in an area primarily inhabited by migrant workers, it was not common to see someone dressed elegantly and looking handsome.</p><p>"Excuse me, sir, could you tell me how to get to Ma Jia Hutong?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had never been here before, and his GPS did not provide such detailed directions. To save time, he asked one of the middle-aged men with a beard, who was about forty to fifty years old.</p><p>"Are you going to Ma Jia Hutong?"</p><p>Dahu zi heard Zhu Tianlei's words and seemed quite surprised.</p><p>"Yes, I'm looking for someone."</p><p>"What's going on in Ma Jia Hutong today? It seems to be boiling over?"</p><p>Dahu zi muttered to himself, and the others also appeared to agree with him, nodding their heads in agreement.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned.</p><p>"Go forward from here, find a small shop with a red sign, then take a left turn. But little brother, let me add, whatever person you're looking for, it would be best to come another day; Ma Jia Hutong isn't very peaceful today..."</p><p>After saying this, Dahu zi threw his nearly smoked-out cigarette butt on the ground heavily.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei politely nodded in acknowledgment of his words and then walked briskly towards the direction Dahu zi had indicated.</p><p>Dahu zi was right. Taking a left turn from the small shop's side revealed a sign hanging on a small wall that read 'Ma Jia Hutong'. However, due to years of wear and tear, the characters on the sign were slightly blurred.</p><p>The alleyway was long and narrow, and as soon as one stepped in, they could smell an unusual musty odor.</p><p>But none of these things were what Zhu Tianlei wanted to focus on at that moment. His steps did not stop; in a flash, he stood outside the gate of the innermost courtyard in the alleyway.</p><p>A black wooden door shone dimly, with faded couplets barely visible on it.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took a deep breath, trying his best to keep his anger within a normal and rational range. He reached out and pushed open the wooden door.</p><p>The small courtyard inside was in complete disarray.</p><p>With a light tap of his foot, Zhu Tianlei rushed into the house. The situation inside was no better; tables were overturned, chairs were scattered, and bedding lay scattered on the ground.</p><p>Apart from that, there seemed to be no one around. Zhu Tianlei noticed a bowl of water on the windowsill and touched it; the water was still warm.</p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p>Although he didn't know what had happened, Zhu Tianlei knew that this trip would be a waste of time.</p><p>He rushed out of the room. The big-bearded man was still there by the toilet.</p><p>"Brother, I ask you, who came here before me?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei rush in and out like a gust of wind, the big-bearded man jumped in surprise.</p><p>"I...I don't know who they are either, but they were really scary..."</p><p>"How long ago did those people leave? Which direction did they go?"</p><p>"They just left not too long ago...oh...oh...they went north..."</p><p>Before the big-bearded man's words had fully faded, Zhu Tianlei's figure vanished at the entrance of the shantytown.</p><p>The big-bearded man couldn't help but pat his chest. Odd, he thought he was going to feel suffocated just now!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei got in the car and headed north.</p><p>But after only about seven or eight minutes, he saw a seven-seat SUV parked by the roadside. There was someone inside, bending down to mess with their phone.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei recognized this person; he was one of those figures he had seen before.</p><p>"Where's Zhou Gang?"</p><p>"F*ck, speak so loudly...ah...ghost..."</p><p>The bald-headed driver was just about to let loose a string of curses when he realized who the person standing in front of him was. He screamed in shock and threw his phone out the window.</p><p>"Ghost...... Ghost......"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face was grim as he grabbed Halaotou by the neck and yanked him out of the car window.</p><p>"I ask you, where is Zhou Gang?"</p><p>"Grandpa Ghost...... Ancestor Ghost...... I don't know anything. Please let me go......"</p><p>"Don't make me ask again. You know what I can do. Where is Zhou Gang?"</p><p>The force Zhu Tianlei applied increased suddenly, causing Halaotou's eyes to roll back.</p><p>"Cough cough...... Z-Zhou Gang was...... taken...... into the woods...... by our boss......"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression darkened, and as he released his grip, Halaotou collapsed onto the ground, gasping for breath with wide open mouth.</p><p>"Don't move. If you do, you take the consequences!"</p><p>With that said, Zhu Tianlei strode into the willow tree grove by the roadside.</p><p>Halaotou lay still on the ground, truly motionless.</p><p>A man who couldn't even die from a fall off a cliff—what couldn't he accomplish?</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei entered the woods, he immediately heard voices.</p><p>"Zhou Gang, where's the money?"</p><p>"What money?"</p><p>"Don't play dumb with me. Didn't the County Mayor give you the money directly?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood rooted in place, his ears perked up. Despite the speaker's voice being very soft and most of it carried away by the wind, Zhu Tianlei could hear it clearly.</p><p>"I didn't take it."</p><p>"Pah, Zhou Gang, do you think we're all fools? If you hand over the money today, we can still be brothers. But if not...... I'll blow your ass up, got it?"</p><p>"Believe me or not, I don't care. Anyway, I've avenged myself. Zhu Tianlei is dead, go ahead and kill or skin me, whatever!"</p><p>"Heh heh, do you really think I'm scared? Today, let's see what happens....."</p><p>Right after that, Zhu Tianlei heard a muffled groan.</p><p>Just as this person was about to strike again, his wrist was suddenly grabbed by someone.</p><p>"Damn it, who?"</p><p>"You?"</p><p>Zhou Gang's eyes widened when he saw the person approaching. For a moment, he couldn't tell if it was a dream or reality.</p><p>"Damn dog, where did you come from? Daring to grab my hand, do you want to stop working?"</p><p>"Clean your mouth!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei raised his hand and made a sharp crack.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's palm could break trees and shatter stones. Even using only two-tenths of his strength, the man's face immediately swelled up like a bun.</p>

						<p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but smile bitterly.</p><p>What Mao Yu had said also caused him a lot of headaches, as several women hadn't stopped gossiping and undermining him because of it. It was truly unbearable.</p><p>"I say, Advisor Mao, can you stop teasing me? I'm already having a hard time as it is..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Mao Yu with a bitter expression and said.</p><p>Mao Yu smiled happily instead.</p><p>"However, Tianlei, people fear fame just like pigs fear becoming fat. With your newfound fame, troubles are aplenty..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned in confusion.</p><p>Mao Yu took out a stack of printed documents and placed them in front of Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"You're not kidding? It's so rampant?"</p><p>What Mao Yu handed over was a market research report along with several lawsuits.</p><p>Due to Zhu Tianlei's rise to fame, the reputation of Tianlei Pharmaceuticals soared, and the miraculous effects of medicines like Beauty Elixir and Spirit Channeling Powder led to a plethora of counterfeit units and products appearing on the market, such as Tian Shi Pharmaceuticals, Da Lei Pharmaceuticals, etc. Beauty Pills, Marvelous Pills, Mei Qi Pills, and various other names for Spirit Channeling Powder were everywhere, bizarre and varied.</p><p>"What do you think? I've already had the marketing department and legal department collaborate to gather most of the units and individuals suspected of infringement, but it seems like we still have a long way to go!"</p><p>Talking about this made Mao Yu very worried as well.</p><p>She wasn't unfamiliar with infringements, but she had never seen such severe and rapidly developing cases before.</p><p>"Hahaha, don't worry, with Advisor Mao around, it's like having the Sea God Needle in the East China Sea. All demons and devils will escape the sharp eyes of Advisor Mao!"</p><p>"Pah, are you trying to call me the Monkey King by twisting your words?"</p><p>Feathers and Liu Mei raised their eyebrows, laughing and quarreling with Zhu Tianlei for a few sentences.</p><p>Just then, Zhu Tianlei's phone rang.</p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p>Until Zhu Tianlei hung up the call, Mao Yu only heard him say "hello," after which he didn't speak again, but his expression was very strange.</p><p>"It's Zheng Xiuxiu."</p><p>Is it her?</p><p>Mao Yu's face immediately darkened.</p><p>Zheng Xiuxiu had also played a significant role in Zhu Tianlei's success.</p><p>"How can she have the nerve to look for you?"</p><p>Although Mao Yu was highly self-disciplined and could remain calm in any situation, he couldn't help but slam the table when he heard that Zheng Xiuxiu was the one calling Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Ungrateful, repaying kindness with hatred. Zhu Tianlei, you should stay away from such people. Don't be like that farmer in the story of 'The Farmer and the Snake,' do you hear me?"</p><p>When Mao Yu got excited, he even cited a fable.</p><p>"She asked me to save her ex-husband."</p><p>"Ugh! How shameless! Does she think she's someone special? Just splashing dirty water on a person and then turning around to ask for favors, treating you like a three-year-old!"</p><p>Mao Yu spoke with crisp clarity.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, let me tell you that such people are not worth pitying. Don't be so compassionate just because the other party is a woman. You're not alone now; you're the boss of Tianlei Pharmaceuticals, and there are more than a hundred people relying on you for their livelihood!"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei's hesitant expression, Mao Yu immediately gave him another lecture with the feeling of wanting to beat iron into steel.</p><p>"Mao Yu, I think Zheng Xiuxiu must have her reasons..."</p><p>"Bullshit about having reasons! She just takes advantage of your easy-going nature. Who knows what mischief she might be plotting. Don't forget the pain once you feel better."</p><p>For a highly virtuous black horse goddess like Heima to curse, Zhu Tianlei felt that Zheng Xiuxiu was indeed formidable.</p><p>"Alright, alright, I won't go. I won't talk to her!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei made a promise to Mao Yu.</p><p>"Hmph, about right. Finally learned to listen to advice."</p><p>Feeling satisfied with Zhu Tianlei's performance, she gave him some more instructions before squeezing her slender waist and leaving the president's office.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sat at his desk, looking out at the bleak autumn scenery outside. He could hear Zheng Xiuxiu's continuous sobs in his ears.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's jeep was started up, the engine roared, and it sped out of the Tianlei Pharmaceutical factory area in an instant.</p><p>Inside the car, Mao Yu's cheeks were puffed up with anger.</p><p>This Zhu Tianlei really did dote on women!</p><p>The jeep drove down the mountain road. After a recent autumn rain, the roads were very muddy. Although the jeep had a high ground clearance and excellent off-road performance, it still struggled on such slippery roads.</p><p>Mud splashed high into the air, quickly covering the windshield with mud.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei silently vowed that he would definitely pave asphalt roads in the village, one way or another.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sped along the road at breakneck speed.</p><p>It took him about half an hour to reach a residential building.</p><p>She was truly at her wits' end; otherwise, she wouldn't have had the nerve to beg Zhu Tianlei for help.</p><p>"Mr. Zhu, I......."</p><p>Before she could finish her sentence, the tears fell first.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Zheng Xiuxiu with a blank expression and his face remained composed. He came because he didn't want to regret it in the future, but that did not mean he was indifferent to Zheng Xiuxiu's previous actions.</p><p>"Speak up!"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei's attitude, Zheng Xiuxiu forced herself to hold back her tears.</p><p>A few minutes later, Zhu Tianlei followed Zheng Xiuxiu into a villa.</p><p>The villa was situated halfway up the hill, standing alone with an area of over a thousand square meters. It was surrounded by lush green trees. When Zhu Tianlei and Zheng Xiuxiu arrived at the entrance, a man in a brown-yellow work uniform opened the heavy iron gate for them.</p><p>After they entered, the heavy door creaked shut again.</p><p>In the vast courtyard, pavilions, terraces, towers, strange flowers, and rare plants were scattered around, with one scene every few steps. For someone like Zhu Tianlei who grew up in the countryside, this decoration design was absolutely something he had never seen before.</p><p>However, from the moment they entered, Zhu Tianlei's expression remained indifferent. He did not look at anything, as if everything before him had nothing to do with him. He merely walked forward calmly and steadily like a mountain.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you really are chivalrous! This girl almost ruined your reputation, yet you still stand up for her. I must say, Qin is truly impressed!"</p><p>Just as they entered the villa's grand hall, Zheng Xiuxiu suddenly quickened her pace and slipped into one of the rooms, brushing past Zhu Tianlei. Zhu Tianlei followed close behind.</p><p>Just as I saw a man sitting on a tiger-skin sofa, he was around forty years old.</p><p>He had a sturdy build, drooping eyebrows, triangular eyes, and a scar stretching from the corner of his eye to his earlobe, resembling a centipede, looking ferocious and terrifying.</p><p>In late autumn, this man was bare-chested, with tattoos on both arms: one side depicting a green dragon waving its tail, and the other showing a white tiger growing wings.</p><p>The most striking feature was that he was wrapped in bandages. From the position of the bandages, it seemed that this person had sustained severe injuries.</p><p>Zheng Xiuxiu stood beside him, lowering her head and showing no reaction to anything he said. In the room, there were at least twenty people, all staring intently at Zhu Tianlei with hostile eyes.</p><p>Among them was one whom Zhu Tianlei recognized well—the greasy man who had cheered for Zheng Xiuxiu at the entrance of Tianlei Pharmacy that day.</p><p>“What is your purpose in having me here?”</p><p>In just a few seconds, Zhu Tianlei observed everything in the room. He looked at the man on the chair and asked casually,</p>

						<p>John turned his head and was surprised to see Zhu Tianlei. This doctor was too young, looking even younger than his son. John had always enjoyed wilderness expeditions and knew the consequences of being attacked by a bear, but the other party's tactics were truly formidable.</p><p>"Thank you, Doctor Zhu, you've given me a second chance at life. I'll remember you for the rest of my days!"</p><p>John spoke sincerely, which made Zhu Tianlei feel somewhat embarrassed. He glanced at the still listless black men and walked over to pat each of their shoulders lightly. The few people instantly regained their freedom.</p><p>Upon regaining their freedom, they all rushed towards John, chattering away in English for a while, then suddenly turned as one and bowed deeply to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, they had offended you before. Please forgive them."</p><p>John, true to his reputation as an expert on China, used idioms effortlessly.</p><p>"They were all worried about you; I can understand that. But this Wan Tao......"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei gave Wan Tao a pointed look and stopped halfway through his sentence.</p><p>Wan Tao's heart raced with fear, afraid that Zhu Tianlei might say something unfavorable.</p><p>"John, being injured by the bear earlier really scared me. Fortunately, we weren't far from the hospital and had Doctor Zhu, who is such an accomplished doctor, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to account for myself to Secretary Song."</p><p>Wan Tao quickly took over, not forgetting to flatter Zhu Tianlei, hoping that Zhu Tianlei would spare him out of respect for his praise.</p><p>"When the bear came, Wan ran so fast!"</p><p>John said nonchalantly, naturally referring to Wan Tao as 'Wan'.</p><p>"Heh heh...... It was an instinctive reaction, an instinctive reaction......"</p><p>Wan Tao felt extremely embarrassed. However, even if time were to go back, he would still run away. Come on, he was the only son in his family, they relied on him to carry on the Wan lineage; how could he possibly risk his life for a John?</p><p>John didn't speak anymore, but it was clear that he had lost trust and interest in Wan Tao. Instead, he was very enthusiastic about Zhu Tianlei, insisting that Zhu Tianlei should be his attending physician. Zhu Tianlei couldn't refuse and could only nod in agreement.</p><p>The next morning, the first thing Zhu Tianlei did when he arrived at the hospital was to visit John's ward. Upon seeing Zhu Tianlei, several black men greeted him enthusiastically, calling him 'Doctor Zhu' over and over again, making even Zhu Tianlei, who considered himself quite thick-skinned, feel somewhat uncomfortable.</p><p>"Call me Doctor Zhu, okay? These pig farmers are most afraid of people always talking about knives, it affects the pigs gaining weight!"</p><p>The several black men were confused, but John on the bed burst into laughter. The movement was too sudden, pulling at his wound, so he had to force himself to stop laughing.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, you're so humorous! I like you!"</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, do you know much about traditional Chinese medicine?"</p><p>After chatting aimlessly for half a day, the conversation turned to Traditional Chinese Medicine. Hearing Zhu Tianlei's unique insights on traditional Chinese medicine, John became very interested and asked curiously.</p><p>"Yes, I can say so. I myself come from a TCM background, so I naturally understand traditional Chinese medicine."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei wasn't being modest; he was eager to promote Traditional Chinese Medicine. This was precisely the right opportunity!</p><p>"That's great, Doctor Zhu. I came to Yinhai City to invest and build a Chinese herbal medicine processing plant. Since you are so proficient in Chinese medicine, I would like to hire you as my company's consultant. How about it?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was stunned. Invest in a Chinese herbal medicine processing plant?</p><p>Wouldn't that be taking away his job?</p><p>"Cough... John, I'm afraid I can't help with this. You'd better find someone else!"</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>John truly admired Zhu Tianlei, so he pushed for more information.</p><p>"There's a Chinese saying, 'People have different aspirations,' and my aspiration is not in this area."</p><p>Although John was very disappointed, he knew that a gentleman should not force others to do what they do not want, and could only reluctantly give up.</p><p>"Oh right, does Dr. Zhu know about Tianlei Pharmaceutical?"</p><p>Eh.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had just relaxed when John brought up Tianlei Pharmaceutical again! He really did question till the bottom of it!</p><p>"I know a little bit."</p><p>"I am very interested in Tianlei Pharmaceutical and have always wanted to visit for a tour. I wonder if Dr. Zhu could spare some time to accompany me?"</p><p>Looking at John's earnest face, Zhu Tianlei was filled with internal conflict!</p><p>What should he say?</p><p>"N-no no no, this company is new but remarkable! I heard about the efficacy of their medications on the plane; it's almost miraculous. The CEO of Tianlei Pharmaceutical is said to be a young man, right? Oh, he's called Zhu Tianlei, Dr. Zhu..."</p><p>Just as John was getting excited, he suddenly stopped and looked at Zhu Tianlei questioningly.</p><p>"Dr. Zhu, if I'm not mistaken, your name is Zhu Tianlei, isn't it?"</p><p>Well!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei scratched his head. At this point, if he didn't admit it, he would be letting down the three characters "elder brother."</p><p>"I am Zhu Tianlei from Tien Lei Pharmaceutical."</p><p>"Ha ha ha, that's great, that's great!"</p><p>Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, John excitedly sat up, scaring Zhu Tianlei who quickly held his shoulder. Was this foreigner's emotional state too abnormal? He hadn't even healed from all the trouble he had been through! Why was he stirring things up again!</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, I want to invest, invest in your company!"</p><p>What?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei instinctively wanted to reject him. Tien Lei Pharmaceutical was running smoothly and efficiently, with ample funds; there was no need to attract external capital.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, please rest assured. I don't want shares in the company, just want to be your overseas agent."</p><p>Although he was a foreigner, John was very adept at navigating human relations. With a single glance from Zhu Tianlei, he understood the other man's concerns.</p><p>"John, Tien Lei Pharmaceutical is just starting out and even finding supplies for nearby areas is difficult. We haven't really thought about expanding internationally yet."</p><p>Forget about the overseas market; even the current expansion speed made him feel somewhat out of control. His rejection was purely genuine, without considering whether the other party might take shares.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, please don't reject me so hastily. I am very optimistic about Tien Lei Pharmaceutical's prospects and also about you as a person. I can wait, three or five years is no problem. I have always wanted to bring this amazing traditional Chinese medicine to my country and the world."</p><p>When John said these words, his expression rarely became serious.</p><p>"I am Zhu Tianlei from Tien Lei Pharmaceutical."</p><p>"Ha ha ha, that's great, that's great!"</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, John leaped up in excitement, causing Zhu Tianlei to quickly support him by the shoulder. The foreigner's emotional response seemed a bit too intense; he hadn't even fully recovered from all his troubles! What was going on?</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, I want to invest in your company!"</p><p>What?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei instinctively wanted to decline. Tien Lei Pharmaceutical was running smoothly and efficiently, with ample funds—it did not need external investment.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, please rest assured; I do not want shares in the company, only to be your overseas agent."</p><p>Despite being a foreigner, John was adept at navigating human relations. A single look from Zhu Tianlei revealed his concerns.</p><p>"John, Tien Lei Pharmaceutical is just starting out and even securing local supplies is challenging. We have not really considered international expansion yet."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke the truth; his initial plan was to set up a Chinese medicine processing factory, modeled after a small workshop. He had never imagined such rapid growth.</p><p>Forget about the overseas market—current expansion speeds felt almost uncontrollable to him. His rejection was genuine and did not involve any consideration of taking shares.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, please don't reject me so hastily. I am very optimistic about Tien Lei Pharmaceutical's prospects and you as a person. I can wait, three or five years is no problem. I have always wanted to bring this remarkable traditional Chinese medicine to my country and the world."</p><p>John spoke these words with an unusual seriousness.</p><p>"I am Zhu Tianlei from Tien Lei Pharmaceutical."</p><p>"Ha ha ha, that's fantastic news!"</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, John leaped up in excitement, causing Zhu Tianlei to quickly support him by the shoulder. The foreigner's emotional response seemed a bit too intense; he hadn't even fully recovered from all his troubles!

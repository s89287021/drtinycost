						<p>Zhu Tianlei didn't even open his eyes and followed Yao Jianxiong on a sprint to the Yao family home.</p><p>On the way, the two people didn't even have time to speak.</p><p>"Lei Zi, sniffle sniffle, is Uncle really going to die......"</p><p>As soon as they entered the door, Liu Meixiang's wailing could be heard. Yao Gang had collapsed beside the stove at the entrance and was motionless.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei reached out and felt under Yao Gang's carotid artery, then he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>"Jianxiong, turn your father over, let him lie flat."</p><p>In just two days, Yao Jianxiong had also lost some weight. For the past nineteen years, he had lived in his parents' shelter, smooth sailing all along, never experiencing any setbacks. But what happened in these two days had already exceeded his capacity to bear.</p><p>"It's fine, your father just stopped breathing."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was sending spiritual energy while clearing Yao Gang's airway to help him breathe on his own and getting his heart to resume a normal rhythm quickly.</p><p>"Cough cough......"</p><p>Yao Gang regained consciousness very quickly. It only took two minutes for him to come around. Seeing Zhu Tianlei squatting in front of him, Yao Gang's old face flushed red instantly.</p><p>"Son's father, Tianlei has saved your life time and again. If you still hide it from me, I, Liu Meixiang, will look down on you!"</p><p>After Zhu Tianlei left yesterday, the couple had quarreled over this matter. Unfortunately, Yao Gang was stubborn in nature, so after a series of arguments, Liu Meixiang naturally ended up losing.</p><p>But after Yao Gang fainted again, Liu Meixiang's spirit was completely shattered. She couldn't bear this life full of constant worry. She didn't want to be rich and famous; she just wanted her family to live together in peace and safety. But right now, even this most basic wish seemed unattainable.</p><p>"You old hag, what do you know?"</p><p>Yao Gang shot a glare at his wife, then looked at Zhu Tianlei, feeling somewhat awkward.</p><p>Tian Lei, last night Uncle thought about it all night and this matter indeed shouldn't be hidden from you.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't speak. Yao Jianxiong was puzzled, as the things that happened at home were always kept from him by his parents, but at this moment, he still sensed a sense of oppression and awkwardness in the atmosphere.</p><p>"Jianxiong, you're grown up now, it's time to hear some things too!"</p><p>Yao Jianxiong helped Yao Gang stand up and sat on a wooden stool nearby. Liu Meixiang asked Zhu Tianlei to sit as well, but he shook his head and leaned against the door frame.</p><p>Only then did Yao Gang slowly begin to speak.</p><p>"About ten days ago, Tang Qingshan sent me a message through someone else, asking me to visit my old home in Donghu. I've been away from Donghu for over thirty years and have even changed my name and surname. I don't want to think about anything related to Donghu anymore, so I put this matter aside without responding."</p><p>Yao Gang finished speaking and sighed.</p><p>"I originally thought that this matter would be over with, but I didn't expect a week ago, Tang Qingshan actually called me, saying he wanted to set up a factory in Hamagou and asked me to find him a piece of land. Tian Lei, you know, our Hamagou is a mountainous area; there's no extra land to give him. Moreover, I don't want any connection with the Tang family."</p><p>Upon hearing the words "set up a factory," Zhu Tianlei's expression couldn't help but change.</p><p>"Set up a factory? What kind of factory?"</p><p>"I'm not sure about the specifics either, it seems like a pharmaceutical factory!"</p><p>Pharmaceutical factory?</p><p>It wasn't strange that Zhu Tianlei was sensitive; could there really be such coincidences in the world?</p><p>"Tian Lei, your face doesn't look good. Did you not sleep well last night?"</p><p>Yao Gang saw Zhu Tianlei's poor expression and asked worriedly.</p><p>"It's fine, Villager Leader, please continue!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei regained his composure and let Yao Gang continue speaking.</p><p>"After that, there wasn't much. Tang Qingshuan called me twice a few days ago, threatening and intimidating me to help implement this matter. I didn't take it seriously, but I never thought Tang Qingshuan would be so sinister, sending people to poison me."</p><p>Thinking about how close he had come to losing his life, Yao Gang hated the Tang family and Tang Qingshuan even more.</p><p>"Villager Chief, have you ever considered why they set up a pharmaceutical factory in Toad Creek? According to what you said, Donghu is thousands of miles away from Yunhai, and Toad Creek is a remote and impoverished area. Why did they choose to build the factory there instead of somewhere else?"</p><p>Yao Gang looked at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"I've thought about this question as well. The Tang family in Donghu has been a weaving pioneer, with no experience in pharmaceuticals; none of their ancestors have ever been doctors or herbalists. So when Tang Qingshuan suddenly wanted to build a pharmaceutical factory, I was quite surprised too."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's doubts were the same place where Yao Gang himself could not find an answer.</p><p>"Where is Tang Huangshan?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei knew that since Yao Gang had spoken up, it must be true. Since Yao Gang didn't know, the breakthrough must come from Tang Huangshan.</p><p>"He's still tied up in the east room!"</p><p>Yao Jianxiong led Yao Gang into the east room where Tang Huangshan was lying on the kang (traditional Chinese bed), snoring loudly with his mouth foaming.</p><p>This person really had a big heart; he could sleep soundly even when bound, as if he were at home.</p><p>"Get up, get up!"</p><p>Yao Jianxiong, having understood the full story, showed no courtesy to Tang Huangshan. Seeing him sleeping like a pig, Yao Jianxiong slapped him across the face.</p><p>"Who? Who dared hit me?"</p><p>Tang Huangshan was in deep sleep and suddenly received a slap. He immediately became furious, trying to sit up but forgetting that he was tied up. With too much force, he bumped his head on the edge of the kang with a clang, then started wailing in pain.</p><p>"Little brat, dare to hit your old man? Do you want a rebellion?"</p><p>Tang Huangshan grinned and shouted at Yao Jianxiong. Yao Jianxiong wasn't used to his attitude either; he raised his left hand and slapped him hard. Tang Huangshan's half face swelled up, and he wanted to curse again, but seeing Yao Jianxiong's murderous eyes, he held back.</p><p>"Tang Huangshan, I only ask once, so think carefully before you speak!"</p><p>Tang Huangshan turned his head and noticed Zhu Tianlei standing by the door. He had a natural fear of Zhu Tianlei; the boy seemed to be a tough character.</p><p>"W-what do you want to know?"</p><p>"Why did you set up your pharmaceutical factory in Toad Gully?"</p><p>Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, Tang Huangshan was taken aback, and a glint of calculation flashed in his eyes.</p><p>"Is it any of your business? We can build our factory wherever we want; do we need your permission?"</p><p>Tang Huangshan was used to this manner of speaking. Although he feared Zhu Tianlei, his tone didn't change much.</p><p>"I said, I only ask once!"</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei reached out and grabbed Tang Huangshan's neck, then forcefully prised open his jaw with his fingers. Something cool touched the tip of his tongue and slid down his throat, making a gulping sound as it entered his stomach.</p><p>"W-what did you give me to eat?"</p><p>"You'll find out soon enough. What is intestinal perforation? Ants drilling into your heart."</p>

						<p>Outside the door, a dark line of people stood in formation.</p><p>As Zhu Tianle emerged, all eyes were on him.</p><p>Xue Ping's eyes were slightly bloodshot, Shen Haifeng's lips were pursed and trembling, Li Ping and Li Yong leaned against each other, their shoulders shivering.</p><p>The others did not speak, but the eagerness in their gazes was as dazzling as stars in the night sky.</p><p>Zhu Tianle clenched his fists without speaking, merely nodding lightly to everyone present.</p><p>For the third drug trial, Kong Shengbin remained calmly composed, taking the pill with a smile.</p><p>"Brother Kong, I guarantee this is the last time you'll have to take the drug!"</p><p>Zhu Tianle said firmly, looking at Kong Shengbin's smiling face.</p><p>Kong Shengbin returned Zhu Tianle's smile. He trusted Zhu Tianle unconditionally from the moment he opened his eyes.</p><p>"We should go back now; the effects of the drug will not appear until tomorrow. However, everyone must remember not to disclose this matter."</p><p>Zhu Tianle no longer appeared anxious as before but had gained a bit more confidence. His confidence was like a beam of light piercing through the haze for the entire quarantine zone.</p><p>In the afternoon, Zhu Tianle rarely felt in such a mood and brewed a pot of Biluochun tea, sitting in his office and sipping it slowly.</p><p>He did not used to enjoy the taste of tea leaves; the slightly bitter flavor brought no aesthetic pleasure and instead left him with a dry, tight sensation in his mouth, even less pleasant than drinking plain water.</p><p>However, over time, especially after Tianle Pharmaceutical was established, Mao Yu often brewed tea and frequently invited him to share. Gradually, he came to appreciate the taste and now even loved drinking tea.</p><p>Watching the steam rise gently, Zhu Tianle took a deep breath in comfort, letting the aroma of the tea leaves fill his mouth and nostrils.</p><p>"Quickly, quickly! My eyes are about to pop out!"</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was immersed in a rare moment of peace, a commotion suddenly came from the corridor.</p><p>"Shh, keep it down, don't let Dr. Zhu hear!"</p><p>A voice from a nurse.</p><p>"Director Li said not to tell Dr. Zhu, but if anything happens to the patient, we can't afford the responsibility!"</p><p>"You talk too much! Director Li has already said that he will take the blame if something goes wrong. Hurry up, any more delays and it'll be too late!"</p><p>"Oh okay, let's go quickly!"</p><p>As the voices grew fainter, Zhu Tianlei stood up, hesitated briefly, opened the door, and followed in the direction the two people had gone.</p><p>"Jiang Haitao, come down fast! It's dangerous!"</p><p>"Yes, come down quickly! If you fall, you won't survive!"</p><p>...</p><p>Zhu Tianlei rushed out to see a fat man wearing a patient's gown sitting on the rooftop of the isolation area.</p><p>This man was Jiang Haitao from Room 1132, a salesman for a private company. He was thirty years old and had just been kicked out by his wife last month. Unexpectantly, he hadn't recovered from the shadow of divorce when he contracted an infectious disease.</p><p>Jiang Haitao's mood had always been poor, which Zhu Tianlei knew, but he hadn't expected him to become so agitated as to want to commit suicide by jumping off the building.</p><p>"Little Jiang, don't be so emotional. As long as you're alive, there's hope. It's easy for you to jump, but have you thought about what will happen to your parents and your daughter if you die?"</p><p>Li Yong stood at the front, shouting loudly yet trying to be gentle.</p><p>"You're just talking from a comfortable position! My wife ran off with someone else because I couldn't afford to buy her an LV bag. My daughter thinks I'm unambitious, that I don't have a car and can only take her on the bus. My superiors look down on me, berating my poor performance at meetings every day..."</p><p>Jiang Haitao sat on the rain shelter, one foot hanging over its edge. Due to his obesity, each of his movements made him appear as if he might fall off.</p><p>"I've been a coward all my life, and yet heaven still won't let me be, giving me this damned disease. I don't want to die here; I've been a coward for half my life, and now I'm going to stand up straight!"</p><p>Jiang Haitao became more agitated with each word, waving his arms wildly as if he wanted to fly away, causing those gathered below to gasp in surprise.</p><p>"Haitao, it's better to live than to die. Besides, the disease you have isn't untreatable; Doctor Zhu will soon find a way to cure it. You can't give up!"</p><p>Li Ping pleaded with patience that he had never shown his wife or son before. However, his words not only failed to calm Jiang Haitao but rather inflamed him.</p><p>"Pah, Zhu Tianlei is just a waste of space. If he had a solution, Wu Xiaohui wouldn't be dead? He's a monster in human form, lacking women so badly that he even dared to treat patients. If it weren't for her going with Wu Xiaohui, Wu Xiaohui might still be alive!"</p><p>"Jiang Haitao, who told you this nonsense? Don't you know who Doctor Zhu is? Without him, you wouldn't have survived the second day after entering the quarantine zone..."</p><p>"Pah, he shouldn't have saved me in the first place. If he hadn't, I wouldn't be suffering like this now. Zhu Tianlei is a bastard, a bastard... Hahaha..."</p><p>Jiang Haitao laughed loudly, his jowls trembling.</p><p>Not far from the quarantine zone was the hospital's ward building. Usually, few people would venture near the quarantine area, but due to Jiang Haitao's loud voice, many of the hospital patients' families and medical staff emerged from the ward building, watching from a distance.</p><p>Jiang Haitao's unreasonable behavior ignited Li Ping's anger, making his previous mildness and caution impossible to maintain.</p><p>"Jiang Haitao, are you speaking human? Doctor Zhu saving you was a mistake? I agree. People like you who are ungrateful, even turning kindness into hatred, deserve to die!"</p><p>Li Ping was furious with Jiang Haitao. These days, he had also been suppressed; his wife had repeatedly cried on the phone, saying she would divorce him as soon as he got out. As a doctor, he had to maintain a good attitude every day, but he too was human and tired.</p><p>Jiang Haitao's attitude became the spark that ignited Li Ping's anger instantly.</p><p>"You're right, I deserve to die. Anyway, my life is redundant now, so I'll just go..."</p><p>With those words, Jiang Haitao suddenly stood up.</p><p>Li Ping's heart stopped beating for a moment. Everyone stared at Jiang Haitao like fools, and the timid woman shrieked in fear, covering her eyes.</p><p>"I jumped!"</p><p>As soon as he said this, his obese body, wrapped in a white hospital gown, plummeted from the sixth floor.</p><p>People outside the isolation area, far away, also let out cries of shock.</p><p>In that critical moment, when life hung by a thread, a figure shot out from the crowd, like a flash of silver light or fireflies in the sky. In an instant, he stood on the ground below.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu!"</p><p>Someone shouted.</p>

						<p>Dong Kui walked at the front, his face wreathed in a wild and savage smile.</p><p>"Bureau Chief Zhao, these two people are trying to frame me! Please help me uphold justice!"</p><p>Dong Kui pointed at Zhu Tianlei and the old man standing behind him, addressing the man with a square face.</p><p>"Are you Zhao Zhigui?"</p><p>The old man ignored Dong Kui, raised his foot, stood beside Zhu Tianlei, and asked.</p><p>"I am Zhao Zhigui. How do you know my name?"</p><p>When he was still the chief of the police station, he had often drunk with Dong Kui, and their relationship had been good. Dong Kui was also very courteous, always sending gifts during festivals, so when Dong Kui asked for his help with such a minor matter as being framed, he immediately agreed without hesitation.</p><p>"You don't need to worry about that. I just want to tell you something: I suffered from an asthma attack in the car, and this young man saved me. But Dong Kui is now accusing us of colluding to extort him. What do you think of that?"</p><p>Zhao Zhigui was taken aback; what Dong Kui had told him was different!</p><p>"Bureau Chief Zhao, don't believe these two scoundrels! They are professional frame-ups. I have been running this route for many years, and all the local residents know me, Dong Kui. Even if I see a small cat or dog on the road, I would go out of my way to avoid them. How could I possibly lie about something like this!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but curl his lips into a smile.</p><p>"Why are you smiling?"</p><p>Dong Kui felt a shiver run down his spine at Zhu Tianlei's laughter and instinctively asked.</p><p>"Nothing, I just suddenly remembered a saying: the thief cries 'catch the thief!'"</p><p>"You... brat, this is Bureau Chief Zhao of Dayhe County Public Security Bureau. See how much longer you can continue your arrogance! Hmph!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei gave Li Dongkui a cold glance and then his gaze fell on Zhao Zhigui.</p><p>"Before a bureau chief who acts for the people, this is called confidence, not arrogance. Before a bureau chief who favors relatives, I am also not afraid of arrogance!"</p><p>"Well said! Zhao Zhigui, how do you plan to handle this matter!"</p><p>The old man looked at Zhu Tianlei with admiration and his tone was laced with praise.</p><p>Zhao Zhigui looked at the situation before him and was momentarily uncertain. In theory, such a small matter did not need him, the Public Security Bureau chief, to step in. He also knew that Li Dongkui merely wanted to vent his frustration. After careful consideration, Zhao Zhigui made his decision.</p><p>"No matter what, the two of you come with me back to the bureau to cooperate in understanding the situation. What about this car full of people? We can't delay everyone's affairs. Dongkui, why don't you take them to their destination first?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression quickly darkened. Zhao Zhigui's arrangement already revealed his answer; he believed Li Dongkui's words.</p><p>"Bureau Chief Zhao does not even inquire into the facts before making us go back for investigation. Truly a clean official, but I, Zhu Tianlei, do not plan to cooperate!"</p><p>Zhao Zhigui did not expect Zhu Tianlei to embarrass him in front of others. If it was previously just for Li Dongkui's sake, now it was to maintain his own dignity.</p><p>He could not help but also frown.</p><p>"Cooperating with the police is a duty of all citizens, and moreover, someone has reported you two. Whether or not you want to cooperate is not your decision. Xiao Yang, Xiao Xu, bring these people into the car."</p><p>Zhao Zhigui said to the two young men behind him.</p><p>The two looked no more than twenty years old, still with a touch of naivety on their faces, most likely freshly graduated from the police academy. Upon hearing Zhao Zhigui's words, they quickly surrounded them.</p><p>Seeing that something was amiss, over half of the people in the car hastily got out, making the car much more spacious.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained calm. As the two junior officers lunged at him, he swiftly kicked one in the side of the chest with his right foot, causing the officer to collapse to the ground in pain.</p><p>At the same time, Zhu Tianlei accurately slashed at the armpit of the other officer with his right hand and then used a reverse force to lift the officer off the ground by the armpit. He then grinned and pushed the officer towards Zhao Zhigui's position.</p><p>"You... you... flipped over, flipping over! You actually dared to attack a police officer. Where are the batons? Hit him for me!"</p><p>Zhao Zhigui had climbed to the position of bureau chief nearly ten years ago. Throughout these years, he had enjoyed smooth sailing without ever being disdained so thoroughly. Thus, his long-pretended facade was torn apart by anger as he ordered the two junior officers to use their batons against Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>At the same time, Zhao Zhigui came up with another plan. While giving orders to the two junior officers, he quickly moved closer to the old man.</p><p>Upon receiving the instructions, both junior officers simultaneously drew out their batons from their waists. As soon as they flipped on the switches, they rushed towards Zhu Tianlei once again.</p><p>This time, Zhu Tianlei was truly enraged. Becoming a police officer had been his childhood dream. In his mind, police officers were heroes who punished evil and promoted good, fought against the strong to protect the weak, towering and unyielding. However, now these police officers seemed to be executioners aiding ruffians in oppressing the virtuous.</p><p>Since that was the case, he did not plan to hold back either!</p><p>Unable to help but look at Zhu Tianlei with full face fear, these two people were not human. How could there be someone so swift and ghost-like in this world? Both of them were excellent graduates from police academy and main players in the sanda team, yet they had not managed a single move against him before being knocked to the ground. It was truly terrifying!</p><p>Zhao Zhigui stared at Zhu Tianlei in disbelief. Upon realizing that his gaze had landed on himself, fear rose within him—an inexplicable fear that quickly spread across his heart like wild grass.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, Zhao Zhigui actually hid behind the old man.</p><p>"Old Man! Old Man!"</p><p>Suddenly, a voice came from beneath the car. A man wearing a brownish-yellow shirt walked in through the door and saw the old man standing at the end of the compartment, his eyes wide with excitement.</p><p>"Oh my gosh, Old Man, I finally found you! Why are you taking a bus? Didn't we arrange someone to pick you up?"</p><p>The newcomer had an expression full of respect, tinged with subtle flattery.</p><p>"The person to pick me up came, but they were supposed to take me to the police station!"</p><p>Looking at the man, the old man said with a mix of mockery and ridicule.</p><p>"What? From the Public Security Bureau? You said Chief Zhao?"</p><p>"Chief Zhao Zhigui of Daheshan County."</p><p>Zhao Zhigui, hiding behind the old man, felt cold sweat running down his back. He... his career as a police chief might be over.</p><p>"Mayor Wu, I... I didn't know that this gentleman was the person you arranged for me to meet. It's a misunderstanding, all misunderstandings..."</p>

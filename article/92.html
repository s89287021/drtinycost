						<p>"I am Zhu!"</p><p>Facing the dozen or so people in front of him, Zhu Tianlei remained unperturbed.</p><p>"Mr. Zhu, my nephew and you have no grudges between you, yet you managed to beat him up like this. Do you have a black heart?"</p><p>Nephew?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei understood immediately.</p><p>"Who is your nephew?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei gave a faint smile as the woman's face darkened like the bottom of a pot.</p><p>"Pah! You knocked my nephew unconscious and still have the nerve to ask who he is. Don't you even bother to find out whose uncle he is? How many heads do you have, huh?"</p><p>"Auntie, don't your eyes work? Can't you see how many heads I have?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, of course, knew who the woman's identity was, but he wasn't afraid. Xu Mingzhe had definitely not been beaten by him. Even if he had wanted to harm Xu Mingzhe, he would never have done so in such a crude manner. As an inheritor of divine medicine techniques, since he could revive the dead with his medical skills, he could also take lives without leaving a trace.</p><p>"You... fine, you won't admit it, will you? Mr. Zhu, let me tell you the truth: I brought people here today to demand an explanation for my nephew. If you don't give one, you won't have any peace!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the woman's fierce expression and then at Xu Mingzhe on the stretcher, wondering whether this family was mentally ill or if they took him Zhu Tianlei for a fool.</p><p>"Why didn't County Magistrate Yang come himself?"</p><p>Fang Yun was startled. How could such matters be left to her husband? With the crackdown ongoing, if someone were to expose them, it might jeopardize his position as county magistrate.</p><p>"Hmph, County Magistrate Yang has many affairs to attend to and no time to waste on you. Get to the point; how do you plan to resolve this matter?"</p><p>Fang Yun did not want to involve her husband in this matter, so she quickly changed the subject.</p><p>"Sorry, since County Magistrate Yang is busy, I don't have time to chat with you all. Feel free to leave!"</p><p>Having said that, Zhu Tianlei prepared to go into the house.</p><p>Fang Yun panicked. She had come today with a clear purpose, thinking she could intimidate this rural bumpkin and achieve her goal easily. She never expected the other party to be so stubborn.</p><p>"Zhu, stop there! I'll tell you honestly, I came prepared today. See these people? They are hired goons paid by me. If you manage to treat Mingzhe's... condition, everything can be settled amicably. But if not..."</p><p>Fang Yun pointed at the people behind her and said to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>She had heard that Zhu Tianlei was very skilled, so she brought a dozen or so hired hands along. These individuals had secretly helped County Magistrate Yang with many difficult issues in the past; they were skilled and loyal, giving Fang Yun great confidence.</p><p>"What condition?"</p><p>"You... you know full well what I'm talking about. Tell me, did you come here voluntarily to be treated, or are these people forcing you to get treatment?"</p><p>County Magistrate Yang and his wife Fang Yun had been married for over twenty years but had no children, so they doted on Xu Mingzhe as if he were their own child. They hoped that one day, if Xu Mingzhe had kids, they would take the surname Yang, effectively leaving a bloodline for County Magistrate Yang.</p><p>However, to their surprise, Xu Mingzhe suddenly fell ill several days ago, even after seeking treatment at massage parlors.</p><p>Fang Yun took Xu Mingzhe to several specialized hospitals and even sought help from many senior doctors through connections. All these doctors were tight-lipped about Xu Mingzhe's condition, and no high-tech diagnostic methods or traditional Chinese pulse diagnosis could pinpoint the cause of his illness, let alone suggest a treatment plan.</p><p>Xu Mingzhe had initially remained silent but eventually revealed the truth under Fang Yun and County Magistrate Yang's insistence. County Magistrate Yang was so angry that he flipped over the table, intending to find someone to deal with Zhu Tianlei severely. However, Fang Yun stopped him.</p><p>As they say, only the person who tied the bell can untie it; since the other party had the ability to render Xu Mingzhe impotent, they must also have the means to restore his potency. But making them admit defeat was impossible; County Magistrate Yang and County First Lady lowering themselves before a rural bumpkin was simply a pipe dream.</p><p>Therefore, apart from humbling themselves, the only other option was to force them into submission.</p><p>"I choose neither. Feel free to leave!"</p><p>Fang Yun's face turned red with anger, truly embodying the saying 'the poorer the bone, the harder it is.'</p><p>"Zhao, this is what you get for it. Xiao Zhang, bring that guy over here for me."</p><p>"Don't worry, sis!"</p><p>Fang Yun gave an order, and a young man with a handsome face and sturdy build responded, then quickly positioned himself behind Zhu Tianlei. Such skill was the best Zhu Tianlei had seen in these recent days.</p><p>"Boy, don't push me to do something I don't want to."</p><p>"Are you Mr. Yang's bodyguard?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned around and asked seriously.</p><p>"No, but I would die for Mr. Yang."</p><p>"Oh, so it's about money."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei blinked, pretending to understand.</p><p>"Boy, stop wasting my time. It's better if you go over there willingly; otherwise, if I have to act, you might end up in a wheelchair for the rest of your life."</p><p>"Brother, are you really that strong?"</p><p>"You... "</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression was so exaggerated that one could easily detect the underlying contempt and disdain.</p><p>"I advise you, brother, don't make money with unethical means; try to avoid boasting too much. Making too much unethical money can shorten your lifespan, while boasting too much might just kill you quicker!"</p><p>Holding onto the doorframe, Zhu Tianlei spoke to the man seriously.</p><p>"Stinking brat, find death!"</p><p>"Zhao, this is what you deserve. Xiao Zhang, bring that guy over here for me."</p><p>"Don't worry, sis!"</p><p>Fang Yun gave an order, and a young man with a handsome face and sturdy build responded, then quickly positioned himself behind Zhu Tianlei. Such skill was the best Zhu Tianlei had seen in these recent days.</p><p>"Boy, don't push me to do something I don't want."</p><p>"Are you Mr. Yang's bodyguard?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned around and asked seriously.</p><p>"No, but I would die for Mr. Yang."</p><p>"Oh, so it's about money."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei blinked, pretending to understand.</p><p>"Boy, stop wasting my time. It's better if you go over there willingly; otherwise, if I have to act, you might end up in a wheelchair for the rest of your life."</p><p>"Brother, are you really that strong?"</p><p>"You... "</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression was so exaggerated that one could easily detect the underlying contempt and disdain.</p><p>"I advise you, brother, don't make money through unethical means; try to avoid boasting too much. Making too much unethical money can shorten your lifespan, while boasting too much might just kill you quicker!"</p><p>Holding onto the doorframe, Zhu Tianlei spoke to the man seriously.</p><p>"Stinking brat, find death!"</p><p>"Zhao, this is what you deserve. Xiao Zhang, bring that guy over here for me."</p><p>"Don't worry, sis!"</p><p>Fang Yun's command was issued, and a young man with a handsome face and sturdy build quickly responded and positioned himself behind Zhu Tianlei, his skill the best Zhu had seen recently.</p><p>"Boy, don't push me to take action."</p><p>"Are you Mr. Yang's bodyguard?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned around and asked seriously.</p><p>"No, but I would die for Mr. Yang."</p><p>"Oh, so it's about money."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei blinked, a look of realization on his face.</p><p>"Boy, stop wasting my time. It's best if you go over there willingly; otherwise, if I have to act, you might end up in a wheelchair for the rest of your life."</p><p>"Brother, are you really that strong?"</p><p>"You... "</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's exaggerated expression clearly conveyed underlying contempt and disdain.</p><p>"I advise you, brother, to avoid making money through unethical means and to boast less. Accumulating too much unethical wealth can shorten your lifespan, while boasting excessively might just cut it short!"</p><p>Holding onto the doorframe, Zhu Tianlei spoke to the man seriously.</p><p>"Stinking brat, find death!"</p><p>The other party's eyes were spinning with anger as they swung their fist, the wind from the punch vicious and their skills indeed exceptional.</p><p>Unfortunately...</p><p>Zhu Tianlei suddenly raised his hand that was resting on the door frame, deflecting the incoming punch. Then, he ducked slightly, raised his right hand to form a palm, and pushed lightly outward, sending the other party's imposing figure flying out, landing with a thud below the stone railings beside the courtyard.</p><p>One block, one strike—two moves in total.</p><p>"Die! All of you attack!"</p><p>However, facing Zhu Tianlei, Zhang Huai's strength turned out to be nothing more than a decoration, such an humiliation that he simply couldn't bear, especially with Fang Yun watching.</p><p>The security men, upon hearing their leader's order, had no choice but to charge forward. Like rabid dogs seeing a meat bun, they surged towards Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei held the door handle with one hand to prevent his mother from getting caught in the crossfire and lightly moved his wrist with the other hand.</p><p>"Bang!"</p><p>"Swoosh!"</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>A series of strange sounds echoed. Fang Yun watched as her security men, who had been like a beacon of security for her, fell to the ground as if they were paper figures under the opponent's hands.</p><p>"County Magistrate Madam, tell County Magistrate Yang that he needs new bodyguards!"</p>

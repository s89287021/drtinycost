						<p>"County Magistrate Deng, if you had seen with your own eyes your good subordinate killing a five-year-old child, witnessed the child's mother weeping heart-rendingly, saw that lively child turn into a cold corpse, only then would it be appropriate for you to discuss whether or not something is excessive!"</p><p>Deng Chang was taken aback and finally noticed that Zhu Tianlei had been saying 'murder' all along. Could it be that Yang Zhongmin actually hired someone to kill?</p><p>No no no, it's impossible. He had known Yang Zhongmin for twelve years, having met him since the county court days and working as a colleague in the county government for six more. He knew that Yang Zhongmin often used his official position to collect some small sums of money, but he had never done anything too outrageous. Therefore, he turned a blind eye to it. After all, he was about to retire soon and didn't want to make enemies.</p><p>Such a person would commit murder, Deng Chang refused to believe it.</p><p>"Little Zhu, there must be some misunderstanding. County Magistrate Yang couldn't possibly break the law..."</p><p>Before Deng Chang could continue explaining, Zhu Tianlei had already dragged Yang Zhongmin out to the door.</p><p>"Because he broke the law, that is why he deserves to die."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words were like an icy dagger, swift and precise, directly piercing Deng Chang's heart. He even forgot to continue speaking to stop Zhu Tianlei, allowing him to be dragged past by Yang Zhongmin.</p><p>Only when Zhu Tianlei's figure seemed about to disappear at the end of the corridor, and only when Yang Zhongmin let out a shrill cry for help, did Deng Chang snap back to reality.</p><p>"Quick, someone! Stop him, stop him for me!"</p><p>Deng Chang was truly panic-stricken. How could he explain to the county leadership, how to the people, and how to face public opinion if Yang Zhongmin were kidnapped right under his nose? Perhaps someone would think it was a scheme devised by himself to eliminate rivals.</p><p>He was about to retire and did not want any unexpected incidents before then.</p><p>As Deng Chang shouted, a group of people in police uniforms rushed into the building from outside with a rustling sound.</p><p>Deng Chang breathed a sigh of relief. Fortunately, the police station was right next door to the county government, and Da Liu was always cautious. Otherwise, the situation would have been unpredictable.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei saw the figure at the head of the crowd, his lips couldn't help but curl upward.</p><p>Sure enough, it's an encounter between enemies.</p><p>"Minzhe, hurry up, grab this brat quickly! Uncle Yang has hypertension and can't handle the stress!"</p><p>Seeing his nephew appear, Yang Zhongmin shouted excitedly. However, with his head hanging down, his voice sounded like a chicken choked by its throat, hoarse and unusual.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you've run into my gun today. Let's settle our old and new grudges all at once."</p><p>Xu Minzhe had a dark expression; he hadn't expected to encounter Zhu Tianlei here. In recent days, avenging Zhu Tianlei had become an integral part of his life.</p><p>That's why he had asked Yang Zhongmin to find someone to transfer him from the lucrative customs department to be deputy director at the police station. Today was only his third day in office.</p><p>Truly, it was fate that gave him such a quick opportunity for revenge.</p><p>"Brothers, this brat actually dared to kidnap the county mayor! It's sheer audacity and heinous crime. All of you attack! Whoever captures this brat, I'll take you all out for drinks at Grand Mansion."</p><p>Xu Minzhe was skilled in handling people; despite only being there for three days, he had become buddies with everyone in the police station. His position as the nephew of the deputy county magistrate made them fear and flatter him to some extent.</p><p>The Grand Mansion, mentioned by Xu Minzhe, was the most famous entertainment venue in Dahan County. Despite being within the county, it maintained five-star standards. It was said that a meal there would cost no less than ten thousand yuan, something an ordinary person might never have the chance to experience in their lifetime.</p><p>"Brothers, Director Xu has spoken! Let's attack together!"</p><p>The first to respond to Xu Minzhe was Wang Lin, who was most fawning and two-faced. In just three days, he had become Xu Minzhe's sidekick, saying how he would follow orders without question countless times.</p><p>At Wang Lin's urging, over twenty police officers clenched their fists in anticipation, surrounding Zhu Tianlei tightly.</p><p>"Minzhe, act quickly! Uncle Yang can't hold on much longer!"</p><p>Seeing Xu Minzhe hesitate, Yang Zhongmin was so anxious that his eyes were almost spitting fire. Who knew how terrified his heart was at the moment?</p><p>"On!"</p><p>Xu Minzhe squeezed out a single word through his teeth, and twenty people immediately rushed towards Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei carried Yang Zhongmin and gave Xu Mingzhe a cold glance.</p><p>It was said that Xu Mingzhe had been brought up by Yang Zhongmin and Fang Yun. Indeed, it seemed to fulfill the saying, "If the beams are crooked, the rafters will be askew." The result of constant exposure was that Xu Mingzhe, the nephew, resembled his uncle like two peas in a pod.</p><p>"Xu Mingzhe, it seems even severing your lineage couldn’t make you remember!"</p><p>Aim for the vital spot.</p><p>Severing one's lineage was Xu Mingzhe's nightmare and humiliation. Being publicly called out by Zhu Tianlei felt as if he had been stripped naked and thrown onto the street.</p><p>As they spoke, the police officers in uniforms approached Zhu Tianlei, only to see him carrying Yang Zhongmin, darting through the crowd like a delicate butterfly, causing chaos wherever he went.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Zhu Tianlei stood beside Xu Mingzhe.</p><p>"Xu Mingzhe, this time I will make you remember thoroughly."</p><p>With that, before Xu Mingzhe could react, Zhu Tianlei kicked him in the chest.</p><p>The kick sent Xu Mingzhe flying straight out, his body crashing heavily onto the stairs.</p><p>"Puh!"</p><p>Xu Mingzhe's throat tasted sweet as he coughed up a mouthful of blood.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, what...what did you do to me?"</p><p>Just as Xu Mingzhe was about to curse loudly, he suddenly felt a suffocating pressure in his chest, as if a few hundred pounds were crushing it, making it hard for him to breathe. He knew this feeling wouldn't be simply due to broken ribs.</p><p>"You'll find out soon enough!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke slowly, each word seeming to take seconds apart.</p><p>"I don't want to fight you guys, you'd better take care of yourselves. Mayor Deng, goodbye!"</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei picked up the continuously screaming Yang Zhongmin and got into a jeep, which sped away.</p><p>Struck down by Zhu Tianlei with lightning speed, they still couldn't figure out how they ended up on the ground.</p><p>Deng Chang's face was extremely grim. In broad daylight, dozens of people watched helplessly as Zhu Tianlei abducted Yang Zhongmin, completely destroying his dignity and that of the county government.</p><p>Xu Mingzhe punched the concrete stairs, but as soon as he exerted force, an excruciating pain shot through his chest, followed by a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Before Deng Chang could think of what to do next, another van sped away.</p><p>"Mayor Yang, Zhu Tianlei is too arrogant; he actually abducted Vice Mayor Yang!"</p><p>Deng Chang took the phone from Da Liu's hands, his voice tinged with tears. He truly felt humiliated, and more so by his inner fear of Zhu Tianlei. It was because of this fear that he remained as motionless as a statue.</p>

						<p>But, despite all that, Zhu Tianlei’s eyes did not waste such a good opportunity. His gaze darted and landed on Hao Xinmei’s waist, as white as snow.</p><p>Just above the exposed hipbones, there was faintly visible black lace trim. Slightly higher up, there was an indistinct view of the edge of a prominent mountain peak, wrapped in light pink fabric.</p><p>Stimulated by this, the mountain peak beneath the fabric trembled slightly. Zhu Tianlei felt his mouth go dry and a ball of fire burning inside him.</p><p>"Xinmei!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei’s voice was hoarse as he softly called Hao Xinmei’s name.</p><p>"You’re not allowed to look!”</p><p>Hao Xinmei had never experienced anything with a man before, and now she was being stripped by one, revealing half of her body. Although the man was someone she liked, her face still turned bright red.</p><p>"Xinmei, I……I want to touch you……"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei’s gaze was fixed, but facing Hao Xinmei, his inherent self-doubt prevented him from being as carefree with her as he had been with Yang Xiaoxue, Zhang Yuntao, or Ma Lanlan.</p><p>Hao Xinmei was about to refuse, but seeing the slight embarrassment and carefulness in Zhu Tianlei’s handsome face, her heart softened immediately.</p><p>"Mm!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei’s voice was weak like a mosquito. At that moment, Hao Xinmei was just a girl lost in love, delicate and shy, completely different from the formidable female judge who navigated the business world with decisiveness.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was somewhat excited as his fingers extended slightly trembling.</p><p>He slowly, cautiously, placed his hand on Hao Xinmei’s fair skin. Instantly, an electric current spread from his fingers throughout his body.</p><p>Hao Xinmei, experiencing such close attention for the first time from someone of the opposite sex, felt her heart pounding almost out of her chest. Yet, she could not deny that this unfamiliar sensation brought a mix of joy amidst her nervousness.</p><p>"Xinmei!"</p><p>"Hmm!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei whispered softly in Hao Xinmei's ear, and her body immediately melted like spring water, becoming soft.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's lips slowly glided over to the delicate lips that were as rosy as March cherry blossoms.</p><p>The first taste was like sugar, the second like honey, and the third like opium—impossible to resist!</p><p>As their lips met, Hao Xinmei's mind went blank, giving in to her primal desires. Zhu Tianlei was burning with desire, his hands inching closer, slowly penetrating deeper.</p><p>"Xiao Mei, I want you!"</p><p>"Hmm......"</p><p>At this moment, Hao Xinmei was enveloped by a strange yet heavenly happiness and beauty. She clung to Zhu Tianlei's shoulder, her body hot to the touch.</p><p>With the beauty's consent, Zhu Tianlei flipped over abruptly, fully embracing Hao Xinmei, pressing her beneath him. His large mouth descended urgently, and the woman's soft moans beneath him sounded like drums on a battlefield, igniting Zhu Tianlei's wild instincts.</p><p>"Bang bang bang!"</p><p>The sudden noise almost made Zhu Tianlei spit blood!</p><p>Had he done something terrible in his previous life—jumping into a well while holding someone else's child or being completely lawless by killing and stealing—or why was he always interrupted at crucial moments?</p><p>A sinister fire flared up instantly.</p><p>"What are you banging on, what are you banging on?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei rolled down the car window and roared angrily, but......</p><p>"Hey, you......"</p><p>On the car window, a clear blood handprint. Beneath the car, a person covered in blood, whose face could no longer be recognized, lay on the ground. Only faintly visible beneath the bloodstains were a pair of stubborn eyes.</p><p>"Tiandei?"</p><p>Hao Xinmei straightened her clothes and then grabbed an overcoat from the backseat, putting it on. Seeing that Zhu Tiandei still had no reaction and noticing nobody outside, she finally asked, her rosy face still flushed.</p><p>"Xiao Mei, stay in the car; don’t come out!"</p><p>Before Hao Xinmei could reply, Zhu Tiandei pushed open the car door and got out, then slammed the door shut.</p><p>The person on the ground was a woman.</p><p>How could a woman be covered in blood like that.</p><p>It was already dark. Although Zhu Tiandei had night vision, the woman was completely soaked in blood, so without an examination, he couldn’t determine where she was injured.</p><p>Moreover, he hesitated for a moment. A woman being hurt this badly suggested that something serious was happening. Would his rash action bring trouble to himself, or even Hao Xinmei?</p><p>"Save my child... please..."</p><p>The woman suddenly spoke, and Zhu Tiandei was startled to find that she had a baby in her arms. The newborn baby was barely wrapped in a bloodstained swaddle, which he hadn’t noticed before.</p><p>A child was the only existence in this world that was unrelated to any enmity or ugliness.</p><p>Zhu Tiandei crouched down and took the baby from the woman’s arms. It was a girl, but at that moment, the little girl had a blueish complexion and her breathing was so weak it was almost imperceptible.</p><p>"Save her..."</p><p>The woman’s voice was very weak; she had just given birth, her strength nearly depleted.</p><p>Zhu Tiandei lifted the swaddle from the infant and carefully examined it, finding nothing unusual. Suddenly, his gaze fell on the baby’s mouth, and he extended a finger to gently open the child’s tiny lips.</p><p>A pungent stench of meconium assaulted the nostrils, and Zhu Tianlei immediately understood why the newborn was breathing weakly and had a bluish complexion. However, the infant was too small; administering an injection would be impossible, and rushing to the hospital might be too late.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's heart skipped a beat, then he suddenly lowered his head, pressing his mouth tightly against the baby's mouth.</p><p>"You... you beast......"</p><p>The woman had originally wanted Zhu Tianlei to take her child to the hospital. She hadn't expected him not only to refuse but also to do this right in front of her.......</p><p>"Pu!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei raised his head, spitting out a mouthful of greenish-yellow pus-like substance, then lowered his head again, repeating this action several times—about seven or eight.</p><p>"Waaah waaah waaah!"</p><p>The silent newborn suddenly burst into loud cries, piercing through the night air.</p><p>"T-t-this......"</p><p>The woman realized she had wronged Zhu Tianlei and felt embarrassed and guilty. However, she didn't understand why he would put his mouth to her child's or what those substances were that he was spitting out.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's act of rescuing the infant happened to catch Hao Xinmei's eye as she had just leaned out the car window. Hao Xinmei felt profoundly moved.</p><p>"Xiao Mei, take care of this child first."</p><p>Seeing Hao Xinmei lean out, Zhu Tianlei didn't hesitate; Hao Xinmei was taken aback but, seeing the wide-open eyes of the tiny infant with its soft, adorable features, naturally reached out to hold it.</p><p>Only then did Zhu Tianlei look back at the woman, intending to check her injuries.</p><p>"No need, I'm fine. This blood isn't mine!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned; not hers?</p><p>Who is it?</p>

						<p>"Gimmie, call hubby!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei squatted down, his tongue like a delicate hand of a lily-picking maiden, probing back and forth in the deep spring to find the tenderest lotus roots.</p><p>"Hub......husband......"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao couldn't withstand this sensation that felt like both hell and heaven, blushing as she called out.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei kissed Zhang Yuntao's rosy face with satisfaction, then flipped her over to face the mirror behind them.</p><p>High mountains covered in snow, red plum blossoms painted a picture.</p><p>The scene in the mirror made Zhang Yuntao unable to look directly at it; her pretty face blushed so deeply that it seemed ready to bleed.</p><p>"Open your eyes, be good......"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao opened her eyes. Zhu Tianlei wrapped his arm around her narrow waist and placed it beneath the snow peak, then leaned forward, merging with her as one.</p><p>In the mirror, the scenery was beautiful and serene, with spring breezes blowing gently without end.</p><p>The passionate and romantic encounter came to an end. Looking at the woman's flower-like sleeping face on the bed, Zhu Tianlei bent down to lightly kiss her forehead, then covered her up with the blanket. He got dressed and left.</p><p>He wanted to preserve their reputations as much as possible. Although he couldn't achieve 100%, at least he wouldn't give others something to talk about.</p><p>......</p><p>There were a few more days until Chinese New Year.</p><p>Although orders kept coming in like snowflakes for Tianlei Pharmaceutical, Zhu Tianlei still notified Han Lin to draft a notice for the Spring Festival holiday, adding one week beyond the legal holiday.</p><p>"Chairman, isn't this bonus amount a bit too high?"</p><p>In the office, Han Ling looked at the bonus distribution details in his hand and said hesitantly.</p><p>He had been working in HR for quite some time and had also worked for two other pharmaceutical companies besides Sunshi Pharmaceutical. Of course, he was well-aware of the salary and benefits of other companies within the HR circle, but no company's bonuses came close to this proportion.</p><p>Fifty percent of the total wage, which was equivalent to 18 months' salary!</p><p>Although it wasn't coming out of his own pocket, he would actually receive more. However, after half a year of working together, Han Ling admired and respected Zhu Tianlei immensely.</p><p>He originally thought that the other party was just a small hoodlum from the countryside who had reached his current position purely by chance. However, Han Ling gradually realized that Zhu Tianlei's charisma was unparalleled among all the bosses he had met.</p><p>He hoped this young man would go even further and also hoped that Tianglei Pharmaceutical would thrive. He had already moved his wife and children to Hamagu Gou and was ready to make Tianglei Pharmaceutical the culmination of his career.</p><p>"Director Han, how much do you think is appropriate?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei fiddled with the newly customized company calendar on the table. Initially, he wanted to print some voluptuous women wearing bikinis on it, but Mao Yu berated him from head to toe, and the young planners led by Tu Feng secretly ridiculed him.</p><p>As a result, there were no bikini beauties; instead, a bunch of health tips ended up on the calendar, which looked rather unappetizing.</p><p>"According to normal distribution rules, I think 20% would already be very attractive, after all, we are a company with profit as our goal."</p><p>Han Ling was quite experienced in the HR field. The data he provided was based on comprehensive considerations and had been scientifically verified and calculated.</p><p>"Director Han, I come from a farming background and have no education, so I don't understand much about these professional things. But I know one thing: if I make money, everyone should benefit together. Only then will they be willing to follow me, Zhu Tianlei, and work for Tianglei Pharmaceutical. What do you think?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stopped fiddling with the calendar and looked at Han Ling seriously.</p><p>Looking at this young chairman who had increased the company's value by over 20 million in just half a year, with some youthful innocence still evident in his eyes, Han Ling suddenly smiled.</p><p>Having worked as an HR professional for so many years, he had always focused on calculating various input-output ratios based on his professional expertise but had forgotten that human hearts are the highest management standard of any company.</p><p>And this captain without any professional background or knowledge of modern corporate management had navigated through the fog and seen the Eden hidden behind it before more people could.</p><p>On the twenty-sixth day of the twelfth month, Tianlei Pharmaceutical welcomed its first annual gathering.</p><p>Early in the morning, the grand hall was bustling with activity.</p><p>For many people, their income from Tianlei Pharmaceutical over half a year had already surpassed all they had earned through hard work in the past three years. Therefore, their happiness was genuine and could not be concealed under any circumstances.</p><p>A huge LED screen displayed Tianlei Pharmaceutical's corporate promotional video, turning the entire hall into a riot of lights and flowers. Wang Feng’s “I Want to Fly Higher” echoed throughout every corner of the grand hall.</p><p>Tianlei Pharmaceutical now officially had 277 employees, and with invited family members and villagers who came uninvited just to join in the festivities, the grand hall that could accommodate 500 people was overcrowded, leaving no room. The empty ground outside was equally packed with people.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao wore a brand new cotton cheongsam that accentuated her graceful waistline and the contours of her figure perfectly, causing Zhu Tianlei to pinch her earlobe behind the door in the makeup room.</p><p>"Come, Huizi, have some candy!"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao was now the mainstay of the public relations department. Events like today's reception were handled by her. After several months of training, Zhang Yuntao had shed her previous shyness and bashfulness, becoming graceful and efficient.</p><p>At this moment, she led several young women from the public relations department with trays of candy to distribute among the guests who came to support them.</p><p>Since the parasitic infection incident last time, Huizi had grown increasingly robust. At just ten years old, he was nearly as tall as Zhang Yuntao.</p><p>"Auntie, you are so beautiful!"</p><p>Huizi said with a beaming smile after taking the candy.</p><p>"Brat, don't be so sweet before you even eat the candy!"</p><p>In the past, Zhang Yuntao might have blushed deeply, but now she did not feel embarrassed at all; instead, she felt a bit proud.</p><p>She was Zhu Tianlei's woman, and she hoped to become someone others praised, something Zhu Tianlei could take pride in.</p><p>Staring at the alluring and captivating Zhang Yuntao, the villagers began to gossip again.</p><p>"Tsk tsk, look at that, Chen Widow must have had some rotten luck to get dragged into Tianlei Pharmaceuticals by Zhu Tianlei. Look at her now....."</p><p>"Pfft, what rotten luck? She's just a fox. She used to seduce men all over the place; she probably hooked up with Tianlei......"</p><p>......</p><p>A few middle-aged women watched Zhang Yuntao’s figure, their mouths full of idle and spicy gossip, but it couldn’t hide the sour jealousy.</p><p>"Look at that little minx, her boobs are so big... bigger than ever before....."</p><p>"Hmph, who knows what kind of antics she's up to in bed......"</p><p>.......</p><p>A group of men gathered together, their eyes glued to Zhang Yuntao as if coated with glue, their jealousy even stronger than the middle-aged women’s.</p><p>In other words, Zhang Yuntao used to belong to everyone, the object of desire for all the men in Toad Gully. Now, she had become someone else’s private property; it was only natural that they would feel jealous.</p>

						<p>"You... dare hit me?"</p><p>Slap!</p><p>The other half of the man's face also swelled up.</p><p>"Do you have guts to hit again...?"</p><p>Slap!</p><p>"What are you, a dog? Where do you come from?"</p><p>Zhou Qiang looked at Zhu Tianlei and finally realized that this was real, not an illusion. The cliff fall he had thought would be fatal did not take Zhu Tianlei's life.</p><p>"He is Zhu Tianlei."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>As soon as Zhou Qiang said it, the man whose eye had been punched shut opened his eyes wide in surprise.</p><p>Is this a human or a ghost?</p><p>Didn't they say he was dead?</p><p>"Did you participate too?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei heard both of their conversations clearly. Since the other party knew that Yang Zhongmin was behind the incident, he could not be an outsider.</p><p>"What did I participate in? I don't know what you're talking about, I don't know..."</p><p>When he realized the man standing in front of him was Zhu Tianlei, this man immediately chose to act stupid and ignorant, completely concealing his arrogance.</p><p>"Are you with the Black Eagle Society?"</p><p>Suddenly, Zhu Tianlei noticed a tattoo hidden under the man's collar, a black eagle about to take flight.</p><p>He had seen this eagle on many people at Qin ZHUang and within the Black Eagle Society.</p><p>"I......I......I'm no longer part of the Black Eagle Society."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's deeds in the Black Eagle Society were well-known throughout the underworld. Not only was he feared, but even Qin ZHUang would tremble upon hearing his name.</p><p>"Has the Black Eagle Society not disbanded?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pretended to ignore the man's words.</p><p>"Was the Black Eagle Society involved in this matter?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei continued to question.</p><p>"I......I really don't know anything, Brother Zhu, Lord Zhu, please spare me this time, I really have no idea!"</p><p>"You know who I am and should be aware of my capabilities. If I can dismantle your Black Eagle Society, I can certainly deal with you."</p><p>"I......Alright, I'll say it. Ever since Lord Zhu last caused chaos in the Black Eagle Society, the Big Boss fell ill. Anyone mentioning Zhu Tianlei makes him tremble, and later he couldn't even bear to hear the word 'Zhu'......."</p><p>The man sighed as he spoke.</p><p>"We're all just living off others, lazy and ignorant of farming. Besides collecting protection money, we have no other way to earn a living, so we had to think up some schemes on our own. A few days ago, I heard from my brothers in the streets that the county magistrate of the Yellow River County was hiring people, offering a commission of 100,000......"</p><p>The man would pause after every two sentences, carefully observing Zhu Tianlei's expression.</p><p>"But we wouldn't dare to act when we heard that the person we had to deal with was you, Mr. Zhu."</p><p>The rest of his words were left unsaid, but Zhu Tianlei already knew.</p><p>He looked at Zhou Qiang standing on the side; to be fair, this Zhou Qiang seemed more principled compared to Halaotou and others.</p><p>"Zhou Qiang, I don't know what deep grudges we have between us, but attacking a defenseless child like that is something I cannot forgive. So, will you come with me willingly or do I have to take action?"</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, I admit that you are very impressive, but even if you are, you shouldn't have dealt such a vicious blow to my brother. He has already been arrested; why would you still want to finish him off? I need to avenge my brother. If it means making you suffer, going to hell is worth it for me."</p><p>Zhou Qiang stuck out his neck without showing any sign of giving in.</p><p>"Your brother?"</p><p>"Tang Qingshan."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Zhou Qiang thoughtfully.</p><p>"People gather with those like themselves......"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei let out a cold snort.</p><p>"Yang Zhongmin is already at Tianlei Pharmaceutical. You will be able to reunite with him soon."</p><p>"Haha, Zhu Tianlei, you underestimate me, Zhou Qiang. I would rather die than let you insult me."</p><p>Saying that, Zhou Qiang took something out of his pocket and was about to put it in his mouth.</p><p>"Want to die?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei flicked his finger, and a leaf flew out like a dagger, directly piercing Zhou Qiang's finger. The leaf cut through his finger instantly, causing the blade to fall.</p><p>Suddenly, another leaf flew out and hit Zhou Qiang’s chin, dislocating his jaw as it was forcefully wrenched to one side. Standing by the side, a man from Black Eagle Society was already too scared to stand still.</p><p>Damn, Zhu Tianlei is not human; no wonder Qin Zhuang shuddered at the mere mention of this name. From today on, he would probably suffer the same fate as Qin Zhuang.</p><p>"If you’re a man, act with courage and integrity. Don’t make me have to intervene again."</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei turned and walked out of the willow grove, leaves rustling beneath his feet.</p><p>The man from Black Eagle Society glanced at Zhou Qiang, then at Zhu Tianlei’s retreating figure, and quickly followed him. It was better to be proactive.</p><p>Zhou Qiang hesitated for two seconds before following suit.</p><p>Hagaitou, who had been waiting by the roadside, had an exceptionally expressive look on his face when he saw Zhu Tianlei emerge.</p><p>In just over twenty minutes, this kid hadn’t moved an inch, not even changing the position of his hand that was propped up on the ground. He had literally frozen the ice beneath him into water with his buttocks.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei drove the car, following Hagaitou’s lead to find everyone who had participated in the incident. The process went so smoothly that the man from Black Eagle Society couldn’t help but gape in amazement.</p><p>Upon seeing Zhu Tianlei, those people followed him into the car as if they were under a spell, not even waiting for him to speak.</p><p>He felt an overwhelming pride in his ability to bend and adapt, read the situation accurately.</p><p>When the car re-entered Tielai Pharmaceutical, it was already dark.</p><p>Surprisingly, neither Yang Wenjie nor those who had come to spectate left. Moreover, several police cars were parked in the courtyard.</p><p>Yang Zhongmin still stood in the same spot.</p><p>Over the years, he had become accustomed to a life of comfort and luxury, standing when he could sit, sitting when he could lie down. He had never experienced such torment before. In just a few hours, it felt like an eternity.</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei enter, he strangely felt a sense of relief.</p><p>Zhang Gu turned around and saw Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Thinking back to their first meeting, Zhang Gu felt a taste in his heart that he couldn't quite describe. This young man had once been an insignificant rural youth, but within less than half a year, he had become someone whom even Zhang Gu had to be wary of.</p><p>His teacher Sun Jianguo, a formidable business tycoon in Cloudy Sea City, had already fallen into a precarious situation because of Zhu Tianlei, to the point that the mayor had personally called Zhang Gu, who was deputy bureau chief of the Public Security Bureau, here.</p><p>"Mr. Zhu, we meet again!"</p><p>Given Yang Wenjie's presence, even though Zhang Gu was uncomfortable inside, he still forced a smile and greeted him first.</p><p>But Zhu Tianlei only glanced at him before passing by.</p><p>Zhang Gu's face turned awkward.</p>

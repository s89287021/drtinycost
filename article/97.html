						<p>Tian Lei, come on, let's go to the village hall for a meeting!"</p><p>The leader was none other than Tan Daque. Ever since Zhu Tianlei had helped his daughter-in-law give birth to Tan Xinseng smoothly, Tan Daque regarded him as a bringer of good fortune and bad luck in his family, greeting him with an electrifying presence that left Zhu Tianlei feeling both numb and tingling.</p><p>"Meeting? Uncle Tan, I'm not a village official or a party member. Why would I need to attend? You guys go without me!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not feel like mingling with the village's key figures; he was not of their ilk, so naturally they had little in common.</p><p>"Come along, come along. They say today’s meeting is specifically for you."</p><p>What?</p><p>Before Zhu Tianlei could react, Tan Daque and a few other uncles dragged him to the village hall.</p><p>The village hall consisted of two rows of bungalows, with the largest room serving as the conference room. However, it was rarely used throughout the year; most matters were resolved in the village chief's office. Hence, today’s meeting was clearly extraordinary just by its venue.</p><p>When Tan Daque and company carried Zhu Tianlei into the conference room, there were already quite a few people inside. Upon seeing Zhu Tianlei, they all stood up to greet him warmly.</p><p>This scene made Zhu Tianlei feel somewhat guilty.</p><p>A mere twenty-something rogue who had been despised in Hamagou earlier, he was now 'everybody's darling.' This stark contrast would make anyone uncomfortable.</p><p>"What’s going on? Our village hasn’t held a major meeting in years."</p><p>"Yeah, I’m puzzled too. Could something have happened? Second Uncle of the Child, do you know?"</p><p>...</p><p>Yao Gang had yet to arrive, and the conference room was buzzing with discussions as everyone whispered about the purpose of the meeting. Zhu Tianlei sat quietly in the corner without uttering a word.</p><p>After five or six minutes, Yao Gang and Shan Xing entered one after another, finally calming down the chatter in the conference room.</p><p>"Villager Leader, gather everyone. What is it about?"</p><p>The one who spoke up was Li Fugui, a powerful figure in the village. Although he did not get along with Yao Gang very well, Li Fugui played an advisory role at crucial times, so Yao Gang would often consult him on matters big and small.</p><p>"Today, I have gathered everyone to discuss something important."</p><p>Yao Gang explained the situation, causing the previously subdued murmurs to resume.</p><p>"What? Villager Leader, say it again!"</p><p>Fat Aunt was the first to stand up, her voice shrill like a megaphone.</p><p>"I know that our Hama Gou village has limited arable land, with the best plots concentrated on Liang. However, the village's requisition of this land is for development and improvement of everyone's living standards..."</p><p>"Cut it out, Villager Leader, your words sound better than songs. What does Hama Gou have besides frogs and a bit of land? How are you going to develop an economy?"</p><p>This time, Liu Dahui spoke up. He was a notorious widower who lost his wife at 32. Although he did not seek another marriage, he frequently pursued village widows and married women in private, often speaking provocatively.</p><p>Sure enough, as soon as Liu Dahui finished talking, the meeting room erupted into laughter.</p><p>Fortunately, Yao Gang, having served as the villager leader for over a decade, was used to such situations and remained composed.</p><p>"Cough cough, Dahui, this is a meeting; speak politely. The economic development I mentioned isn't about anything else but a pharmaceutical plant being built in our village, with job opportunities provided to our villagers. Isn't that a great opportunity for Hama Gou's economy?"</p><p>It truly takes art to be an official. That's why more than half of the several hundred votes in Hama Gou went to Yao Gang. He could handle this situation calmly, something that most people would have panicked about, and he spoke so convincingly.</p><p>"Pharmaceutical plant? Who? The Old Hu family?"</p><p>The moment Yao Gang mentioned it, the villagers immediately associated the plan with the Old Hu family, given their economic prowess and experience.</p><p>"Village Chief, I'm putting my words here. My family of six relies on that plot of land up there for our food and livelihood. No matter what happens, even if they put a knife to my neck, I won't give it up!"</p><p>"Yeah, the same goes for us. The Old Hu Family is so rich; why are they stirring up trouble? Besides, we're not counting on them hiring us to work there, bah!"</p><p>The reputation of the Old Hu Family in the village wasn't good. One reason was that the Old Hu Family's behavior and conduct were indeed unsuitable—being wealthy often made them feel superior. The second reason was that resentment toward the rich was common, especially in rural areas; even if you had worked hard to earn your money, people would still envy and resent you.</p><p>After saying this, Yao Gang gave an encouraging look to Zhu Tianlei sitting in the corner.</p><p>"What? Tianlei? That can't be right?"</p><p>"Building a pharmacy isn't a trivial matter; it requires a huge sum of money. Where would the Old Zhu Family get that much money from?"</p><p>"If Tianlei builds the pharmacy, I support him; this guy is righteous!"</p><p>...</p><p>A new round of discussion began, and this time, the atmosphere was notably better.</p><p>"Tianlei, why don't you come up and talk to everyone?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned. To be honest, he had no prior knowledge of this meeting, assuming that Yao Gang would just go around convincing people one by one. He didn't expect such a big commotion. Now he was caught between a rock and a hard place, finding it difficult to move forward or retreat.</p><p>"Tianlei, you go up and talk!"</p><p>Tan Daquan nudged Zhu Tianlei, causing him to stand up instinctively due to the high-voltage electricity of 30,000 volts.</p><p>There was no choice but to face this head-on.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei previously felt hesitant to speak, but once he started, he found himself speaking more smoothly.</p><p>"The pharmaceutical factory requires approximately two mu of land, plus an office area and a testing area, totaling two mu and five fen. Initially, the factory plans to focus on the production and processing of traditional Chinese medicine. I made a rough estimate and think we will need to hire around 40 people."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei explained his plans one by one, hoping to convince the villagers to lease their farmland and willing to show sincerity in doing so.</p>

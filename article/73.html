						<p>Zhu Tianlei issued the order, Yang Hua led two young doctors and a nurse who acted swiftly. Feng Xiaoyu cooperated very well; despite the pus oozing out of the sores on her body due to movement, she did not make a sound.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Feng Xiaoyu's body was secured.</p><p>"Doctor Yang, I am ready to start; it will take about an hour and a half."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Yang Hua. These words were both a statement and a demand.</p><p>"Don't worry, Tianlei, I guarantee no one will disturb us!"</p><p>Yang Hua said this and gave Feng Xiaoyu an encouraging smile on the bed before arranging for the young doctor to take Feng Xiaoyu's stepmother out of the room. Afterward, everyone left the ward until the door was closed.</p><p>"Sis, it will hurt a lot!"</p><p>"I'm not scared, big brother, go ahead! I can't wait any longer!"</p><p>After this brief exchange, Zhu Tianlei took a deep breath and picked up a scalpel from the tray brought by the nurse.</p><p>The scalpel flew through the air, swiftly cutting open the sores on Feng Xiaoyu's arm. As the pus began to flow, a silver needle pierced in with a soft 'pop,' turning shiny silver into dark black instantly.</p><p>Feng Xiaoyu bit her lip; the immense pain made her body involuntarily twitch, but she held back from screaming.</p><p>Time passed slowly, and all sores on Feng Xiaoyu's limbs had been lanced. The white bedsheet was soaked with yellow pus.</p><p>Right as Zhu Tianlei undid Feng Xiaoyu's hospital gown, Yang Hua's voice came from the doorway.</p><p>But he could not afford to be distracted; treatment had reached its critical moment.</p><p>"Yang Hua, who gave you the nerve to treat a patient with people unrelated to the case? If anything goes wrong, can you bear the responsibility, Yang Hua?"</p><p>It was a woman's voice.</p><p>"Deputy Dean, I can guarantee that this person can cure Feng Xiaoyu. If they fail, I, Yang Hua, will resign in disgrace!"</p><p>Yang Hua looked through the window of the ward and saw Zhu Tianlei's back figure, saying firmly, "Hmph, move out of my way!"</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Qi Xuehua was tall and muscular, half a head taller than Yang Hua. She patted Yang Hua on the shoulder, almost pulling him aside.</p><p>"Security guards, pull Chief Yang away from me."</p><p>Perhaps Qi Xuehua had expected this; there were four security guards standing in the hallway. Upon hearing her words, all four of them moved in to grab Yang Hua.</p><p>"You are aiding a tyrant!"</p><p>Yang Hua usually had a good temper, but at that moment, he was so angered by Qi Xuehua's actions that his chest felt stifled. A year ago, he and Qi Xuehua had run for Deputy Dean together; based on seniority, he was more qualified than her. However, Qi Xuehua was cunning and manipulative, pulling all the strings to remove him from the candidate list.</p><p>Although Yang Hua was inwardly seething, he wasn't narrow-minded or obsessed with his career. The matter had gradually faded from his mind over time.</p><p>However, this current situation was different. As a physician, saving lives and treating injuries was paramount in emergencies; he, Yang Hua, would absolutely not yield on this point.</p><p>"Chief Yang, I'm sorry!"</p><p>One of the four security guards spoke to Yang Hua, then all four tried to drag him away from the door. No one noticed that Yang Hua's hand, which had been behind his back, slipped into the doorknob.</p><p>"Qi Xuehua, if you want to go in, step over my corpse!"</p><p>Qi Xuehua's face changed. She hadn't expected the soft-spoken Yang Hua to be so stubborn. But who was Qi Xuehua? In her entire life, she had never failed to get what she wanted. When she ran for Deputy Dean, Yang Hua couldn't stop her; now, he certainly couldn't prevent her from entering this room.</p><p>"You all just standing there doing nothing! When someone gets hurt, none of you will escape!"</p><p>Qí Xuěhuá roared in anger.</p><p>"Dean Qí, Director Yang's hands are behind his back. If we pull too hard, it'll break!"</p><p>The security guard had already identified the issue; Yang Hua was popular among the hospital staff and didn't have an arrogant attitude. He always greeted people with a smile, so the guards couldn't bring themselves to act.</p><p>"Dean Qí, Director Yang has good intentions. The person in the ward is also a doctor... You see..."</p><p>An intern wearing glasses could no longer watch and stepped forward to speak on behalf of Director Yang.</p><p>"Yes, Dean Qí..."</p><p>Other doctors and nurses echoed his words. These murmurs enraged Qí Xuěhuá like gunpowder.</p><p>Qí Xuěhuá pointed at the intern who spoke first.</p><p>This was a warning by example. If she, Qí Xuěhuá, couldn't handle such matters, she wouldn't have risen to her current position.</p><p>"Does anyone else want to plead for him?"</p><p>After dealing with the intern, Qí Xuěhuá coldly surveyed the others in the corridor. Everyone's eyes were filled with rage, but no one dared to speak up. Only then did Qí Xuěhuá look satisfied at Yang Hua.</p><p>"Drag Director Yang away. If his arm breaks, it's his own fault."</p><p>The four security guards exchanged glances. They were the lowest-ranking staff in the hospital. Qí Xuěhuá was ruthless; dealing with people like them was as easy as squashing an ant.</p><p>"Director Yang, I'm sorry!"</p><p>After finishing, the four of them pulled forcefully, but at that moment, the tightly closed door creaked open.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood inside the door as if he were a celestial being descended from heaven, looking at everyone with a faint smile.</p><p>"Tianlei, I......"</p><p>Yang Hua had a guilty expression and felt deeply remorseful, hating his own incompetence.</p><p>"Who are you? Daring to impersonate a doctor to practice medicine and even attacking people? I have already called the police. You just wait!"</p><p>Qi Xuehua looked at Zhu Tianlei and said word by word.</p><p>"Qi Xuehua, you shrew, are you crazy? You actually called the police, you......"</p><p>Yang Hua was so angry that Qi Xuehua's words made his face turn red.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression did not change in the slightest. He gently pulled Yang Hua's hand, which had been caught on the door handle, and then quietly closed the ward door again.</p><p>"President Qi is truly righteous, but I wonder who told President Qi that I was impersonating a doctor to practice medicine, and which eye saw me attacking people?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said indifferently.</p><p>This Qi Xuehua clearly came prepared. Zhu Tianlei's recent popularity was truly beyond imagination!</p><p>"Hmph, still so calm when caught red-handed, using smooth talk, you are obviously a habitual offender!"</p><p>Qi Xuehua snorted disdainfully with her nose up in the air.</p><p>"President Qi has keen eyesight, even recognizing habitual offenders. Then please tell me, whom have I been accustomed to offending?"</p><p>"Do I need to say? The patients in this ward are the best evidence. You practiced medicine without a license and killed someone, that is the best proof!"</p><p>In Qi Xuehua's eyes, the malevolent look flashed by momentarily.</p><p>"Ah, I see!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei grinned, tugging at his lips, and Qi Xuehua glanced at him before quickly retracting her gaze.</p>

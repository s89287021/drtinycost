						<p>The nursing requirements in the isolation area strictly prohibit medical staff from having any physical contact with infected patients, except for treatment and care.</p><p>"Where is your protective suit?"</p><p>"I felt uncomfortable, so I didn't wear it..."</p><p>Xiao Han lowered her head, her voice as soft as a mosquito's buzz.</p><p>"You should go explain the situation to Nurse Manager Zhao yourself!"</p><p>"I understand!"</p><p>Xiao Han did not utter a word in defense. Although the contact time was short, everyone knew Zhu Tianlei well; he was someone who would endure hardship for others' sake and take good care of them. Getting angry now was also for her own good.</p><p>Seeing Xiao Han being scolded, Xiao Gangbeng's face turned sour as well.</p><p>"Big brother, it's my fault. Don't blame me, okay?"</p><p>After Xiao Han left, Xiao Gangbeng pulled on Zhu Tianlei's sleeve and whispered softly.</p><p>"You haven't answered me yet. Are you feeling unwell today again?"</p><p>"It was just a little uncomfortable in the morning......Okay, I had one nosebleed this morning, but it wasn't much!"</p><p>Xiao Gangbeng originally planned to lie, but seeing Zhu Tianlei's serious expression, he finally told the truth.</p><p>Although they all had infectious diseases, because Xiao Gangbeng already had health issues and his immune system was too weak, his condition was more severe than others'. He frequently experienced nosebleeds. In the first two days, he would have one or two episodes per day, but recently, the frequency of bleeding had gradually increased, and the amount of blood loss was terrifying.</p><p>"Lie down!"</p><p>Xiao Gangbeng always cooperated with routine checks. At five years old, he was mature like an adult.</p><p>"What happened to your hand?"</p><p>Just as he was about to take the pulse of Little Gangbang, Zhu Tianlei noticed a small cut on his arm. Fresh blood was still seeping out, indicating that the wound was quite new.</p><p>"I... I scratched it on the guardrail," Little Gangbang said. The guardrail he referred to was a wire mesh made of iron wires woven together. Since it was makeshift, the workmanship was slightly rough, with many exposed ends of wire.</p><p>Seeing Little Gangbang desperately trying to cover his wound with his sleeve, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but feel amused and exasperated at the same time. He sternly pulled his little arm over and froze upon closely examining the wound.</p><p>Little Gangbang's wound wasn't smooth, and a closer look revealed tiny new granulations forming inside it. The appearance of granulations meant that the wound was healing, but how could such a fresh cut heal so quickly?</p><p>Suddenly, Zhu Tianlei recalled an incident from when he first moved to this isolation ward from the emergency room. That calm-looking middle-aged man named Kong Shengbin had his fingers pierced by a broken bottle of disinfectant and recovered in a very short time. He had asked Kong Shengbin about it, but he was told that he hadn't been like that before.</p><p>Could it be...</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's heart raced as he summoned a nurse to attend to Little Gangbang while he rushed to the drug research lab.</p><p>The research method he used was entirely different from modern medical methods. There were no modern instruments in the room, only piles of processed and semi-processed traditional Chinese medicinal herbs, grinding tools for these herbs, and a notebook filled with notes.</p><p>Through his understanding and research over these days, Zhu Tianlei discovered that the source of this infectious disease lay in a certain food called 'big snail', a species of snail. Both Kong Shengbin and others who had contracted the disease had either consumed or come into direct or indirect contact with big snails. Little Gangbang's father frequently enjoyed stir-fried big snails as an accompaniment to his alcohol.</p><p>He hadn't been without investigating big snails, but his efforts yielded no results, so he put aside further research on them. However, the recent discovery reminded him of big snails again because, in addition to their tender and edible meat, they contained a substance called interleukin-1 receptor antagonist within their bodies, which could accelerate wound healing.</p><p>If he could develop a drug specifically targeting parasites in the big snail's body, might it be possible to improve their condition to some extent?</p><p>With that in mind, Zhu Tianlei instructed the nurse to collect and organize all information about big snails found online, then print them out.</p><p>He turned the pages one by one until it was midnight.</p><p>"Got it!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shouted excitedly and quickly ran to the medicine cabinet, where countless herbs were familiar to him like his left and right hands. He swiftly grabbed several types of herbs.</p><p>That night, Zhu Tianlei did not sleep at all.</p><p>The next morning, with dark circles under his eyes, he took the prepared medicine and entered Kong Shengbin's ward full of vitality.</p><p>Upon receiving the news, Li Yong and Li Ping arrived one after another.</p><p>"Little Zhu, have you figured it out?"</p><p>Kong Shengbin seemed very excited. Although Zhu Tianlei had never shown any negativity or depression, Kong Shengbin had observed his emotions.</p><p>He knew that Zhu Tianlei was an extremely rare young man. Even though the patient was himself, he was more concerned about Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"To be honest, we don't know yet how effective it will be."</p><p>In essence, the current medicine was a trial product, and the first person to take it was like a guinea pig.</p><p>"Just try it!"</p><p>Kong Shengbin laughed heartily and reached out to take the medicine from Zhu Tianlei's hands, even swallowing the pill without hesitation.</p><p>Li Ping and Li Yong did not dare to breathe, staring wide-eyed at Kong Shengbin.</p><p>"This is important; the effects won't be so quick. You two are too tense!"</p><p>Seeing the two men with big eyes observing like children watching ants moving, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but laugh.</p><p>"Yes, Xiao Zhu is right. I am not nervous at all, yet you guys are more nervous than I am. How should I put it... The emperor is not in a hurry, but his eunuchs are... Ah ah, look at my mouth; getting old has made me unable to think straight!"</p><p>Kong Shengbin's words were clearly meant to liven up the atmosphere, but none of them could force a smile.</p><p>As events proved, Zhu Tianlei's medication had failed.</p><p>Near noon, Kong Shengbin's condition flared up again, and it was extremely severe, causing him to faint for a moment.</p><p>This blow pushed Zhu Tianlei into an extreme state of despair. For the entire afternoon, he locked himself in his room and did not open the door no matter who knocked.</p><p>He acted like a capricious child, wanting to isolate himself from the world in this way.</p><p>If they had not touched upon hope, perhaps they would not be as despondent now!</p>

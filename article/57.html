						<p>Director Ke's expression darkened.</p><p>The injured person looked to be under thirty years old, and his condition had clearly stabilized before. Why did it suddenly flare up again?</p><p>The main cause of the patient's critical condition was excessive blood loss, but the patient had an extremely rare Rh-negative blood type, which accounted for only one in a thousand people. Not to mention their emergency center’s blood bank, even if all the blood banks in Cloud Sea City were combined, it would likely not exceed 500cc.</p><p>"Director, I... previously, there was a man who treated the patient; he seemed to have used traditional Chinese medicine. The patient's bleeding did get under control at that time, but..."</p><p>"But what?"</p><p>"But I acted on my own and removed the silver needles that person inserted into the patient!"</p><p>Xue Ping mustered up her courage and finally revealed the truth. Her face turned pale and red, as it was all her; with her arrogance, if this patient died, she would feel guilty for the rest of her life.</p><p>"You... sigh, there's no point in talking about it now. What is that man's name? Do you have any way to contact him?"</p><p>Director Ke had a headache. His student was very intelligent, but sometimes he looked down on others. However, at this moment, he did not want to pursue the matter further; if they could find the person who administered the needles, the patient might still have a chance.</p><p>"No, he told me not to remove the needles and then left. I... don't know his contact information!"</p><p>Director Ke's heart sank. It seemed that the patient was truly fated to die young.</p><p>"Director, I have a business card here; it fell from that person."</p><p>Shen Junfeng, who had been silent all along, stepped forward and handed over the business card he picked up earlier to Director Ke.</p><p>...</p><p>"Hello, is this He Xinmei?"</p><p>Director Ke dialed the phone number on the business card. The card indeed belonged to He Xinmei.</p><p>"I am Hao Xinmei, may I ask who you are?"</p><p>"I am the director of the City Emergency Center. I need to......"</p><p>Director Ke briefly explained the situation. Hao Xinmei knew that lives were at stake and immediately called Zhu Tianlei after hanging up. To her surprise, Zhu Tianlei's phone was off.</p><p>"This Zhu Tianlei, why is his phone turned off?"</p><p>Hao Xinmei muttered to herself, wondering where she could find Zhu Tianlei in the vast city of Yunhai City.</p><p>"Hey, you can't just go in! Director Hao's office isn't something anyone can enter freely!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei felt annoyed and her beautiful eyebrows furrowed at the commotion outside.</p><p>"Little Chen, come in!"</p><p>"Hey, what kind of person are you? Your face is too thick-skinned; I told you that our director is not seeing guests, yet......"</p><p>As Little Chen pushed open the door, another figure squeezed in, making Little Chen's round face turn red with anger.</p><p>"Ming, this gatekeeper maid of yours is quite something, look how she twisted my arm!"</p><p>It turned out to be none other than Zhu Tianlei who had entered.</p><p>"Who pinched you? Your mouth is moving too much; you......"</p><p>"Come with me!"</p><p>Without waiting for Little Chen to finish speaking, Hao Xinmei grabbed Zhu Tianlei's hand and dragged him into the elevator forcefully.</p><p>"Little maid, see? I wasn't lying, was I?"</p><p>"I am Hao Xinmei. May I ask who you are?"</p><p>"I am the director of the City Emergency Center. I need to......"</p><p>Director Ke briefly outlined the situation. Hao Xinmei, deeply aware of the importance of human life, immediately called Zhu Tianlei after hanging up. To her surprise, Zhu Tianlei's phone was off.</p><p>"This Zhu Tianlei, why is his phone turned off?"</p><p>Hao Xinmei muttered under her breath, wondering where she could find Zhu Tianlei in the sprawling city of Yunhai City.</p><p>"Hey, you can't just go in! Director Hao's office isn't open to everyone!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei felt frustrated and her beautiful eyebrows furrowed at the commotion outside.</p><p>"Little Chen, come in!"</p><p>"Hey, what kind of person are you? Your face is too thick-skinned; I told you that our director is not seeing guests right now......"</p><p>As Little Chen pushed open the door, another figure squeezed in, making Little Chen's round face turn red with anger.</p><p>"Ming, this gatekeeper maid of yours is quite something. Look how she twisted my arm!"</p><p>It turned out to be none other than Zhu Tianlei who had entered.</p><p>"Who pinched you? Your mouth is running wild; you......"</p><p>"Come with me!"</p><p>Without waiting for Little Chen to finish speaking, Hao Xinmei grabbed Zhu Tianlei's hand and dragged him into the elevator forcefully.</p><p>"Little maid, see? I wasn't lying, was I?"</p><p>"I am Hao Xinmei. May I ask who you are?"</p><p>"I am the director of the City Emergency Center. I need to......"</p><p>Director Ke succinctly recounted the situation. Hao Xinmei, acutely aware of the urgency, promptly called Zhu Tianlei only to find his phone was turned off.</p><p>"This Zhu Tianlei, why is his phone turned off?"</p><p>Hao Xinmei mumbled to herself, perplexed about where she could locate Zhu Tianlei in the expansive city of Yunhai City.</p><p>"Hey, you can't just barge in! Director Hao's office is not open to everyone!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei felt irritable and her elegant eyebrows knitted together at the commotion outside.</p><p>"Little Chen, come in!"</p><p>"Hey, what kind of person are you? Your face is too thick-skinned; I told you that our director is not seeing guests......"</p><p>As Little Chen pushed open the door, another figure squeezed in, causing Little Chen's round face to flush with anger.</p><p>"Ming, this gatekeeper maid of yours is quite something. Look how she twisted my arm!"</p><p>It turned out to be none other than Zhu Tianlei who had entered.</p><p>"Who pinched you? Your mouth is running wild; you......"</p><p>"Come with me!"</p><p>Without waiting for Little Chen to finish speaking, Hao Xinmei grabbed Zhu Tianlei's hand and forcefully dragged him into the elevator.</p><p>"Little maid, see? I wasn't lying, was I?"</p><p>Before entering the elevator, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help boasting to Xiao Chen for a moment, which made Xiao Chen feel both angry and anxious. She had only started working two days ago and never expected that person to actually know the chairman. Would he report her negative aspects to the chairman?</p><p>"Xiao Mei, look at you, you can't be this anxious just because of me; people are watching!"</p><p>The elevator doors closed, with two other employees inside. After politely greeting Hao Xinmei, they lowered their heads and stood in the corner.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei leaned close to Hao Xinmei and whispered into her ear.</p><p>"Bragging, someone is waiting for you to save them!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei knew what kind of person Zhu Tianlei was, so she just playfully scolded him.</p><p>"Save someone? Who?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was somewhat surprised. He had no objections to Hao Xinmei asking him to help save someone, but who could make Hao Xinmei this anxious?</p><p>"Don't ask, you'll know once we get there!"</p><p>As they spoke, the two of them exited the elevator. Just as they stepped out of the building, a silver-gray Porsche stopped at the entrance, and a tall and beautiful woman got out of the car.</p><p>"General Manager Hao!"</p><p>"Alright, go back to work first!"</p><p>Watching the beauty leave with her slender waist, Zhu Tianlei turned around.</p><p>"Xiao Mei, your taste has changed. Where's that handsome guy from before?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was feeling quite pleased; he was genuinely in a good mood this time. The male assistant and driver had been replaced by women, haha, this must be Hao Xinmei's own decision and arrangement.</p><p>"Shut up!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shrugged and shut his mouth. After all, he was in a very good mood now!</p><p>Hao Xinmei stepped on the gas pedal, and the car sped off.</p><p>The emergency center was not far from Meixin Pharmaceutical Company, and with smooth traffic, it took only about ten minutes for the car to arrive at the entrance of the emergency center.</p><p>Director Ke and Shen Junfeng had been standing at the door. When they saw Zhu Tianlei coming out, Director Ke instinctively frowned.</p><p>Not only did this young man look very young, but his overall demeanor exuded a blend of sophistication and nonchalance. It was hard to believe that such a person could possess such high medical skills.</p><p>Shen Junfeng, on the other hand, was quite agitated when he saw Zhu Tianlei. He had been transferred to work at the emergency center half a year ago, but his daily tasks were mostly about handling emergencies, assisting the director in taking X-rays, and shuttling between various departments to deliver test results and inspection reports.</p><p>Since childhood, he had dreamed of becoming a doctor to save lives and treat injuries. That's why he had worked hard from a young age, starting from a small mountain village to passing the entrance exam for middle school in his county, then graduating from a key high school in the city, and finally attending a provincial traditional Chinese medicine university. However, five years of diligent study, three years of graduate work, and eight years of arduous efforts had only made him feel further away from his dream.</p><p>Just when he was about to give up hope, he suddenly saw Zhu Tianlei. Zhu's composure, extraordinary acupuncture skills, and miraculous treatment results gave him a glimpse of what achieving his dreams could look like.</p><p>"Director, it's him! It's his acupuncture!"</p><p>Shen Junfeng spoke in urgency, as if a fan had unexpectedly seen their long-chased idol, feeling incredibly excited.</p><p>"Director Ke, I've brought the person for you!"</p><p>Seeing the two people standing at the door, Hao Xinmei quickly identified Director Ke and proactively said,</p><p>"Thanks a lot, Xiao Hao. Hello, young man, I'm Doctor Ke Yong, the director of the emergency center."</p><p>Although he was skeptical, there was no better way than to treat him as if he had a chance, given the circumstances. After all, Doctor Ke Yong had been practicing medicine for several decades and knew that there were many talented individuals in this world; judging people by their appearance alone could be inaccurate.</p><p>"Our center has just received a critically injured patient from a car accident with severe internal bleeding. Since we heard you've treated patients before with acupuncture, we're troubling you to take a look... "</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was not a doctor at the emergency center and didn't even count as part of the medical system. Therefore, he had no obligation to help, which is why Director Ke spoke politely.</p><p>Where is the person?</p>

						<p>He was also very angry. Why? He had treated the patient kindly, not hearing a word of gratitude, and instead had been unjustly thrown into jail. Therefore, this was also an outlet for him, a way to find psychological balance.</p><p>"Both are true. The reason Old Joe fell ill again is clear now. It's because President Wei threw away Dr. Zhu's leftover medication and used the medicine on his own, which exacerbated his condition. I have seen Dr. Zhu’s medical skills with my own eyes, so please ask Dr. Zhu to put aside past grievances and save Old Joe!"</p><p>Looking at the middle-aged woman in front of him, Zhu Tianlei had to admit that although her words were not pleasant, she was a bold and straightforward person who spoke and acted honestly, clearly distinguishing right from wrong.</p><p>Because of this, Zhu Tianlei's anger gradually subsided.</p><p>"Alright, but let me make it clear: the patient's condition originally came on fiercely. I relied on my family’s acupuncture technique to temporarily suppress the illness, but now that it has recurred, the danger level has almost doubled. I can only do my best."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was not shirking responsibility; he just didn't want the other party to become overly optimistic. Although he had improved the patient's condition yesterday, he hadn’t figured out the true cause of the illness yet—this was what was meant by treating symptoms rather than addressing the root cause.</p><p>"Alright, no matter the result, I am prepared."</p><p>As they spoke, the car arrived at the entrance of the city hospital.</p><p>Mao Fang and Zhu Tianlei got out one after another. Wei Baoguo stood at the gate; seeing Mao Fang and Zhu Tianlei approaching, his heart pounded, and his face turned red with embarrassment.</p><p>"Director Mao, Dr. Zhu......"</p><p>This time, Wei Baoguo's attitude had undergone a 180-degree change, but this fawning behavior only made Zhu Tianlei despise him more.</p><p>"Wei Baoguo, if anything happens to Old Joe, your tenure as president will be over."</p><p>Mao Fang snorted coldly and ignored Wei Baoguo, leading Zhu Tianlei straight to the emergency ward.</p><p>Wei Baoguo wiped his forehead with his sleeve.</p><p>This time, he sincerely hoped that Zhu Tianlei could save the patient's life.</p><p>He had worked hard for half a lifetime to reach this position and did not want to be knocked down, but he also knew full well that Mao Fang’s words were no idle threat.</p><p>In the emergency room.</p><p>Old Joe's breathing was so weak that it barely could be felt. This time, Zhu Tianlei did not take his pulse before administering spirit energy to Old Joe.</p><p>Spirit energy can sustain life, though it cannot cure all illnesses; at least, it can keep a person alive.</p><p>Old Joe's body was extremely frail, like a bottomless pit. Once the spirit energy entered his body, it quickly vanished without a trace.</p><p>Moreover, what made this different from before was that during the infusion process, the spirit energy seemed to encounter some sort of obstruction. Tiny objects resembling yellow beans continuously collided with the spirit energy, and each collision consumed part of the spirit energy.</p><p>Therefore, it took over twenty minutes for Old Joe's body to slightly regain some vitality.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei began to administer acupuncture.</p><p>This time, neither Mao Fang nor Wei Baoguo opened their mouths again. Instead, both stared intently at Zhu Tianlei's every move.</p><p>One cared about his lover's life, the other cared about his official hat.</p><p>Time passed second by second.</p><p>Outside, clouds rolled and billowed.</p><p>The sky was bathed in rosy light, an endless spectacle.</p><p>Mao Fang covered her mouth in shock.</p><p>Wei Baoguo took a step back in fear.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei retracted the silver needle, his face slightly pale despite the rosy glow of the sunset. Despite the red hue, he could not conceal his fatigue.</p><p>"Old Qiao!"</p><p>This recovery was even more significant than the last one. Only Mao Fang knew how many times her heart had struggled between ice and fire.</p><p>"Young man, are you Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>Qiao Kuang looked at Zhu Tianlei, his voice hoarse as he asked.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded, truly exhausted. This treatment had almost drained all the spiritual energy from his body. It was unclear whether it was due to being too busy lately and neglecting cultivation or if the illness itself was too obscure and difficult to treat.</p><p>"Thank you so much! You've saved me twice!"</p><p>The last time Qiao Kuang woke up, Zhu Tianlei had already left, making it impossible for him to thank him directly. However, by repeatedly questioning Mao Fang, he had gained some understanding of Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>He never expected that before he could recover and express his gratitude personally, he would fall ill again.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Qiao Kuang's weak face devoid of color, yet the warmth in his eyes did not diminish in the slightest due to his suffering.</p><p>This was a gentlemanly man with excellent manners, who naturally evoked a favorable impression.</p><p>"I am a doctor; saving lives is my duty. I need some rest now."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said politely before getting up to leave.</p><p>He felt dizzy, and just as he stood up, his body swayed, causing him to collapse.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not expect to faint.</p><p>When he regained consciousness groggily, the first thing he saw was a face that was icy cold but exquisitely beautiful.</p><p>"Mao Yu, how did you come here?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt a bit guilty because he had plenty of time to notify Mao Yu before being taken away by the police, but he didn't.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, are you really cool?"</p><p>"Little Yu, go ahead and scold me!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hadn't fainted due to illness; after resting for a while, his internal qi was restored, and his spirits immediately returned to normal.</p><p>"I won't scold you, hmph, there will naturally be someone to deal with you!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pursed his lips.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, are you awake?"</p><p>At that moment, Mao Fang pushed open the door and walked in.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei fainted, it truly frightened Mao Fang, Qiao Xiang, and Wei Baoguo. Fortunately, after the examination, they discovered that Zhu Tianlei was merely physically weak, which relieved their anxiety.</p><p>Just as they were about to contact Zhu Tianlei's family members, Mao Yu's phone call came in. They truthfully informed him of Zhu Tianlei's condition, prompting him to rush over.</p><p>"Director Mao......"</p><p>After their previous interactions, Zhu Tianlei had a greatly changed impression of Mao Fang. Seeing her enter the room improved his mood significantly.</p><p>However, Mao Fang's gaze followed Mao Yu all along.</p><p>"Director Mao?"</p><p>"Oh, sorry, I thought that little girl looked familiar, she's very pretty. Is she Doctor Zhu's girlfriend?"</p><p>"Director Mao, stop joking around. I wouldn't dare to have her as my girlfriend; she is the company's corporate advisor."</p><p>"The little girl doesn't look old enough to be a corporate advisor, how amazing! Is she from here?"</p><p>"No way, she seems to be from Pingshan!"</p><p>"Oh, Pingshan, how old is she this year?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but slightly frown. Wasn't Mao Fang showing too much interest in Mao Yu?</p>

						<p>For a family, a child means everything; it means hope. Without hope, how can life continue?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt the pressure weighing heavily on his shoulders.</p><p>He walked to the edge of the bed, placed his hand on Huzi's wrist. The child's pulse was irregular, sometimes slow and sometimes rapid, indicating a disharmony in the blood and qi. However, upon closer inspection, the pulse became slippery, suggesting a condition caused by obstruction from phlegm or food.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned, puzzled about why this child's pulse kept changing.</p><p>"Tianlei..."</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei's somber expression, Lao Suer became even more anxious and restless.</p><p>"Big brother, Uncle, lend me a hand! Help me get Huzi up!"</p><p>No sooner had Zhu Tianlei finished speaking than two men instantly approached, took off their shoes, and carefully lifted Huzi from the bed, one on each side. The eight-year-old child's eyes were closed tightly, silent as death. Even close relatives would feel sorrow at such a sight, let alone someone like Zhu Tianlei who was just an outsider.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei silently took a deep breath. No matter what, he had to save Huzi!</p><p>"Lanlan, take out the silver needles and medicine bottle from my bag."</p><p>On the way, Zhu Tianlei handed his handbag to Ma Lanlan. The bag was actually quite small, containing only a pack of silver needles and a small medicine bottle, but Ma Lanlan knew what Zhu Tianlei handing over the bag meant.</p><p>Now hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, she quickly took out both the silver needles and the medicine bottle from the bag.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei opened the cloth bag, drew out a silver needle, and gently pricked Huzi at the Guanzhong point. The previously silent Huzi suddenly let out a faint moan, though the sound was very low, it still made everyone in the room perk up.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt greatly encouraged and continued to prick several other points including Neiguan, Shenmen, and Ximen with over ten needles in quick succession.</p><p>"Auntie, bring me a bowl of water. Lanlan, take out a pill from the bottle."</p><p>Ma Lanlan quickly took out a pill and, following Zhu Tianlei's instructions, fed it to Hu Zi. She then used a spoon to pour several mouthfuls of water into Hu Zi's mouth before looking at him expectantly.</p><p>After Hu Zi was laid flat again, Zhu Tianlei gently placed his hand on Hu Zi's abdomen, continuously channeling spiritual energy into Hu Zi's body.</p><p>"Ah! Ah! Look quickly, Hu Zi's complexion has improved! Ah, thank goodness, Tian Lei is truly a miracle doctor, like a god descended from heaven!"</p><p>Seeing the purple-black hue gradually fade from Hu Zi's face and his cheeks turn rosy, Liu Sa'er screamed in excitement. Although the others were not as excited as Liu Sa'er, their faces also showed immense joy.</p><p>But just when Zhu Tianlei felt confident that he could soon wake up Hu Zi, a strong chill suddenly spread from the palm of his hand, making him feel like half of his arm had been frozen, numb and stiff.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was not the first to use spiritual energy, and he knew from spiritual medicine practices that spiritual energy could be counterattacked by disease qi. However, he did not expect the force of the counterattack to be so great.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei tried to resist the chill, but it was clearly stronger than him. Reluctantly, Zhu Tianlei had to withdraw his hand.</p><p>Hu Zi's rosy complexion returned to its grayish hue as Zhu Tianlei withdrew his hand.</p><p>"Tian Lei, this......"</p><p>Liu Sa'er had been eagerly waiting for her grandson to wake up, but seeing his face turn purple again after it had improved made her even more anxious, especially when she saw the brief look of shock on Zhu Tianlei's face.</p><p>"Liu Sa'er, don't worry. At least there is no life-threatening danger; I can guarantee that. I have also basically figured out what is wrong with Hu Zi's illness, but I don't have some of the necessary medicines and will need to go get them. Don't worry, I, Zhu Tianlei, promise that I will absolutely not let anything happen to Hu Zi."</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei's assurance, the family's faces softened slightly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei got off the bed, and the family gratefully saw him off all the way out of the village entrance.</p><p>After the family disappeared from view, Ma Lanlan followed Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Tian Lei, are you really confident that you can cure Hu Zi?"</p><p>Looking into Ma Lanlan Jingying's eyes, where concern and worry shimmered, Zhu Tianlei shook his head.</p><p>"I came to console Sixth Aunt. Hu Zi's illness is very peculiar; I haven't figured it out yet."</p><p>"That means Hu Zi might...... die!"</p><p>Thinking of the lively boy who might never open his eyes again, tears streamed down Ma Lanlan's face.</p><p>"Hee hee, you cry at the drop of a hat. I said I couldn't figure it out, but I didn't say Hu Zi would die. Your tears came so quickly?"</p><p>Looking at Ma Lanlan's sky-blue face suddenly turn into a downpour, Zhu Tianlei was startled. Was this woman really made of water?</p><p>"Really? Hu Zi won't die?"</p><p>"He won't. I promise I won't let Hu Zi die!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Ma Lanlan and said seriously.</p><p>Seeing the determination on his handsome face, Ma Lanlan suddenly realized that in the past twenty years, she had never truly known Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>After a brief exchange, they continued walking to the clinic. This time, Zhu Tianlei was unusually silent, abandoning his usual witty banter.</p><p>Before reaching the clinic, they saw a crowd gathered outside, with one woman's voice particularly harsh.</p><p>"Ma Lanlan, you little bitch, if you have the guts, come out and face me! You killed someone and want to hide? Pah!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned; this voice was unfamiliar. He glanced at Ma Lanlan, who also looked puzzled.</p><p>The two exchanged glances and quickly approached the clinic.</p><p>"Lanzi, hurry and hide. This hag might go berserk and do anything."</p><p>Two people had just walked outside the crowd when Auntie Pao grabbed Ma Lanlan by the arm and whispered to her, "Auntie Pao, what’s going on?"</p><p>"Ah, my dear child, if I told you to hide, you should have quickly hidden away. By the time that woman sees you, it’ll be too late to run and hide!"</p><p>Auntie Pao held Ma Lanlan’s arm while pushing her outside.</p><p>"Oh no, you fat woman, what are you doing? That little slut is a murderer! If you let the murderer go, you’re an accomplice, a murderer too!"</p>

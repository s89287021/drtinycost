						<p>Unexpectedly, just as they reached the village entrance, she ran into Sun Jiang. She never thought that Sun Jiang would be so shameless as to follow her; if it weren't for Zhu Tianlei, she would have been bullied by Sun Jiang today without a doubt.</p><p>Thus, when faced with Zhu Tianlei again, her feelings had already changed. However, Hou Suqin's words still echoed in her mind, and she truly could not bear the loss of face to stay at the Zhu family home any longer.</p><p>"What are you thinking about? Don't you know that you're walking into a wall?"</p><p>Only then did she realize that she had unknowingly walked outside the Zhu family compound, just one step away from colliding with the wall.</p><p>"Oh, I didn't notice...... Dr. Zhu, I've been thinking, I still have some things to attend to in the city, so I won't stay here. Hua Rong is left in your care; I'll come back for it in three days!"</p><p>In her panic, Hao Xinmei made up her mind.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned, puzzled by Hao Xinmei's sudden change of heart.</p><p>"This is my business card. If anything happens, call me; no matter what time, I'll rush over!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei casually took out a gold-plated business card from her wallet and directly handed it to Zhu Tianlei, then hurriedly turned around and left. The red high heels splashed mud onto the black stockings, but she paid no heed, not even glancing at Hua Rong in Zhu Tianlei's arms.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked down at the business card in his hand.</p><p>"Managing Director of Mei Xin Group"?</p><p>Night soon fell as Zhu Tianlei stared at the curled-up Hua Rong by the stove. He grew increasingly puzzled about Hao Xinmei's reaction. What had happened?</p><p>He took out the golden business card from under the pillow, held it up to the moonlight, and examined it carefully again.</p><p>"Sigh, Managing Director of a group; looks like I really am a toad wishing for swan meat!"</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as they reached the village entrance, she ran into Sun Jiang.

She never imagined that he would be so shameless as to follow her; if it weren't for Zhu Tianlei, she likely would have been bullied by Sun Jiang today.</p><p>Now, standing before Zhu Tianlei once more, her feelings had shifted. However, Hou Suqin's words still lingered in her mind, and she couldn't bear the thought of losing face by staying at the Zhu family compound.</p><p>"What are you thinking about? Don't you see that you're walking into a wall?"</p><p>Hao Xinmei was lost in thought when she heard a voice and jumped in surprise.</p><p>It then dawned on her that she had inadvertently walked outside the Zhu family compound, just a step away from colliding with the wall.</p><p>"Oh, I didn't notice...... Dr. Zhu, I've been thinking, I still have some things to take care of in the city, so I won't stay here. Hua Rong is left in your care; I'll come back for it in three days!"</p><p>In her panic, Hao Xinmei made up her mind.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned, perplexed by Hao Xinmei's sudden change of heart.</p><p>"This is my business card. If anything happens, call me; no matter what time, I'll rush over!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei casually took out a gold-plated business card from her wallet and handed it to Zhu Tianlei before hurrying away.

His puzzlement only deepened as he tried to understand Hao Xinmei's reaction. What had happened?</p><p>He retrieved the golden business card from under the pillow, held it up to the moonlight, and studied it carefully once more.</p><p>"Sigh, Managing Director of a group; looks like I really am a toad wishing for swan meat!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt a little bitter in his heart!</p><p>He fell asleep with a sour mood.</p><p>"Wang wang wang......"</p><p>The next morning, before dawn, Zhu Tianlei was awakened by the sound of barking dogs.</p><p>He rubbed his eyes and had a moment of confusion; he didn't have any dogs at home!</p><p>"What smell......"</p><p>Suddenly, Zhu Tianlei smelled an incredibly pungent odor. He opened his eyes and saw Hua Rong, with its gray fur, standing beside a pool of dark green substance, barking at him.</p><p>"You...... you little puppy, that's my only good piece of clothing!"</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei saw what was beneath the mess, he lost his temper. That Adidas T-shirt was the first branded item he had bought in his twenty-one years; he had saved up for half a year to buy it, and now...... it had been used as a toilet by this little puppy.</p><p>But there was no point in saying anything now. Zhu Tianlei resisted the urge to tear Hua Rong apart and throw it into the mountains behind his house. He got out of bed and suddenly discovered with great surprise that amidst the mess, there were countless thread-like substances mixed in.</p><p>How amazing?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't believe it himself; he had given Hua Rong a pill the previous night and channelled some spiritual energy to it for a few minutes, and the problem was solved?</p><p>"Hey, does your mom usually abuse you, not giving you food?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sat on the edge of his bed, crossing his legs, looking at Hua Rong, who was eating a pot of steamed potatoes on the ground with disdain.</p><p>Did this look like it couldn't be eaten?</p><p>He, Zhu Tianlei, a twenty-year-old young man in his prime, couldn't finish a whole pot of rice, yet little Hua Rong, which didn't even weigh half as much as a rural dog, finished the entire pot effortlessly.</p><p>"Tiānléi, this little pup is all better now, so you better stop seeing that girl. She’s from the city and looks beautiful; we can’t match up to her!"</p><p>Zhu Tiānléi had just put half of a garlic chive dipped in sauce into his mouth when he suddenly heard his mother say something. The spicy taste went straight down his throat, and it took him drinking half a bowl of water to recover.</p><p>"Mom, what are you talking about? I only saw her once; why did you jump to the conclusion that we’re going to get together?"</p><p>"Léi, your mom is right. That girl clearly isn’t an ordinary person. Our family’s circumstances can’t support her. You just need to find a simple village girl who is honest and hardworking, alright?"</p><p>Zhū Quēzi, who usually didn’t say much, spoke up this time. Zhu Tiānléi’s eyes lit up as he instantly understood something.</p><p>"Did you tell them anything about it?"</p><p>Hóu Sùqín looked guilty and lowered her head without responding, which was essentially an admission.</p><p>Zhu Tiānléi was speechless. No wonder the beauty suddenly changed!</p><p>"Auntie, is Tiānléi around?"</p><p>After breakfast, Zhu Tiānléi was chatting with Huá Róng inside his room, starting from that Adidas incident and going all the way to when he accidentally kicked a hole in his shoe sole while at elementary school. Suddenly, he heard voices from the courtyard.</p><p>He got up and looked through the window, seeing Yang Xiǎoxuě standing in the courtyard.</p><p>Yang Xiǎoxuě was wearing a light pink sleeveless T-shirt today, with tight white leggings beneath it. Her hair was tied into a ponytail, looking very neat and slightly playful.</p><p>Thinking of what happened in the office two days ago, that soft and fragrant feeling on his tongue, Zhu Tiānléi chuckled and carried Huá Róng out of the room.</p><p>"Xiǎoxuě? I say, why has the magpie been calling nonstop early this morning at my front gate? Turns out it knew you were coming!"</p><p>Hóu Sùqín was watering the garden when she saw her son come out. She didn’t say much more, as Yang Xiǎoxuě looked nice and was a primary school teacher. If her son really could marry someone like her, she would die in peace.</p><p>Of course, Hóu Sùqín didn’t know who Yang Xiǎoxuě’s father was!</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue looked at Zhu Tianlei, her snow-white face inexplicably tinged with a rosy hue.</p><p>"Tianlei, I'm going into town in a bit. Do you have any time?"</p><p>"Into town?"</p><p>"Yeah, I want to go home to get something. If you don't have time, it's okay!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue immediately regretted saying that, afraid Zhu Tianlei would say something else, and quickly added.</p><p>"It's fine. I happen to need to go into town for something as well. Just wait a few minutes!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue couldn't help but sigh in relief, then pretended to look at the autumn cucumbers growing in the garden, which were already finger-length long, chatting with Hou Suqin intermittently while her eyes kept glancing towards the house.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei went into the house to change clothes, then put Hao Xinmei's business card in his pocket. Finally, he found a handbag and put Hua Rong inside before heading out.</p><p>Seeing the two young people leave together, Hou Suqin was so happy her eyes almost closed up. She hurriedly rushed into the house to 'report the good news' to Zhu Tazi.</p><p>There was only one road from Hagemao Gou to Yunhai City, with only two buses a day: one at 9:30 in the morning and another at 3:00 in the afternoon. To make it back on time that year, they had to grab every available moment.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue walked ahead, Zhu Tianlei following behind. Unlike the city, women in the countryside liked to gossip about other people's wives. Before Yang Xiaoxue came, her aunts had already warned her repeatedly, so she was quite measured in this regard.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei understood this as well and didn't rush, sauntering along behind her. This way, he could openly admire Yang Xiaoxue's curvaceous and plump buttocks from behind. With each step, they wobbled slightly, like ripe watermelons. Just looking at them made Zhu Tianlei feel his mouth go dry.</p>

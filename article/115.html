						<p>The speaker glanced at Zhu Tianlei. Although he did not know who the other person was, he could see that all the doctors in the hospital treated him with great respect, indicating that he must be someone important and could not be underestimated. After all, his colleague's life was still in their hands.</p><p>"Yes, we have been working overtime recently to meet our targets, working half a month straight without a break. None of us expected Tu Feng, who is so young, to end up like this due to overworking. Doctor, is he going to be alright?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression did not change, but his heart was in turmoil.</p><p>Could it really be that coincidental?</p><p>His mind raced, and he quickly came up with a plan.</p><p>"I can only do my best. Long-term overtime work and an irregular diet are the main reasons for his sudden brain hemorrhage."</p><p>"Oh? Does this mean we could also be at risk of getting such a disease?"</p><p>Since this matter concerned themselves, several of the accompanying employees were very interested in the answer to this question.</p><p>"It's hard to say about that, but if you keep working overtime and maintaining high levels of stress, the possibility is not small."</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei spoke, he withdrew his silver needle and began inputting spiritual energy into the patient's body instead.</p><p>The patient could not die; this was a bottom line and principle. However, he also could not be cured instantly.</p><p>"Oh? The manager just announced that we need to work overtime for another half month or our wages will be deducted!"</p><p>"Don't you give any compensation for overtime?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei asked casually.</p><p>"Compensation? If there were compensation, what would I complain about? Not only is there no compensation, but if we don't work overtime, we won't receive bonuses either. Moreover, full attendance pay will also be deducted."</p><p>Mentioning this matter made the emotions of several people a bit agitated, and for a moment, they even forgot about their colleague on the bed who was fighting for his life.</p><p>"Didn't you guys say that several people have already gone to the hospital recently because of overtime work?"</p><p>"Not really, there are about four, plus Tu Feng, it's five now!"</p><p>"What kind of compensation is the company giving you for this?"</p><p>"Compensation? Even medical expenses are covered by health insurance; the most the company will give is a couple of thousand yuan for nutrition supplements."</p><p>......</p><p>Although Li Ping didn't know why Zhu Tianlei was asking these questions, his absolute trust in Zhu's medical skills and character prevented him from interrupting.</p><p>"Director Li, the patient's condition is stable now. You can resume normal treatment!"</p><p>After finishing his inquiries, Zhu Tianlei released Tu Feng's hand and slowly stood up.</p><p>This confidence was like the sun, shining brightly and unstoppable.</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>The employees who had been complaining until they were thirsty couldn't believe it. This person had been chatting with them about all sorts of things the whole time—how did he cure the patient?</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Li Ping didn't doubt it for a moment and immediately instructed the nurses to coordinate the ward and handle the hospitalization procedures.</p><p>The employees also went out to pick up Tu Feng's family members, while Zhu Tianlei stood by the window in the emergency room, watching the densely packed cars crisscrossing in the hospital courtyard, his hand clenching his phone tightly.</p><p>In the afternoon.</p><p>The President's Office of Sunshi Pharmaceutical Corporation.</p><p>"What? You're saying someone reported this to the Labor Bureau? Didn't you contact Secretary Su?"</p><p>Now, an employee had reported him to the Labor Bureau, and in his state of frustration, Sun Jianguo lashed out at Sun Quan, who had come to report the situation.</p><p>Sun Quan felt deeply wronged. It was Sun Jianguo who had asked people to work overtime and threatened to dock their pay if they didn't. Now that someone else had filed a complaint, he was taking it out on him. Though he felt wronged, he dared not show any sign of resentment.</p><p>"I called Secretary Su; he said he would look into the situation..."</p><p>"Look into what? How much money has Su Changjian taken from me, Sun Jianguo? Now, even this trivial matter requires an investigation! He's enjoying himself too much in that position!"</p><p>In his agitation, Sun Jianguo swept several documents off the desk onto the floor. His face was flushed red, and his temples throbbed.</p><p>Nothing had gone smoothly recently. The teams he had dispatched to deal with Zhu Tianlei had all returned defeated, and not only had he lost money and men, but his wife had also been sniping at him for failing to avenge her son.</p><p>Now, another incident like this was happening in the company, making Sun Jianguo feel that he had aged more in the past month than in the past decade.</p><p>The Secretary Su mentioned by Sun Jianguo was the Deputy Secretary of the Labor Bureau in Yundai City. To put it bluntly, Su Changjian was someone Sun Jianguo had nurtured, and precisely for this reason, he was quite bold in labor relations due to having Su Changjian as a trump card.</p><p>However, now that a minor worker complaint had been filed, Su Changjian said he needed to look into the situation first. This made Sun Jianguo intolerant.</p><p>"Secretary Su, it seems Secretary Su is doing so well in office lately that he doesn't need me, Sun Jianguo?"</p><p>Dialing the phone, Sun Jianguo got straight to the point, his words harsher than usual, not characteristic of him at all.</p><p>"Mr. Sun, please don't be angry. I was just saying I needed to look into the situation. You know how strictly things are being checked recently; I have to..."</p><p>"Don't tell me these things, Su Changjian. If you can't figure this out, from now on, there's no need for Sun Jianguo and Secretary Su to keep in touch. Also, Secretary Su should understand that taking people's money and doing favors comes with consequences. If you don't do your job after receiving payment, Secretary Su should know the repercussions."</p><p>After saying this, without waiting for Su Changjian to respond, Sun Jianguo hung up the phone.</p><p>Sun Quan stood to the side, watching Sun Jianguo vent his boundless anger. He had been by Sun Jianguo's side for nearly a decade, and in all that time, he had never seen him so enraged as he was this month.</p><p>"Sun Quan, have you found out who reported it?"</p><p>"It wasn't an employee of our company; apparently... someone with the surname Zhu, but they didn't give me his full name."</p><p>"Surname Zhu?"</p><p>Sun Jianguo's head throbbed.</p><p>Apart from Zhu Tianlei, Sun Jianguo had no one else to suspect. All the setbacks of his life were due to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Sun Quan, go and bring Tang Qingshan in for me!"</p><p>A ruthless glint flashed in Sun Jianguo's eyes.</p><p>He wanted Zhu Tianlei dead!</p><p>"May I ask who this is Sun Jianguo?"</p><p>Before Sun Quan could reach the door, he was stopped by several men wearing dark blue work uniforms standing there, looking inside the room.</p><p>Sun Quan's heart immediately filled with an ominous premonition.</p><p>"I am Sun Jianguo. May I ask what business you have with me, gentlemen?"</p><p>Despite his inner turmoil, Sun Jianguo remained composed on the surface as he had been a dominant figure in the business world for decades.</p><p>"We are from the Administrative Inspection Department. We have received reports that your company is involved in irregular employment practices and request your cooperation with our investigation!"</p>

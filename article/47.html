						<p>APIOng felt incredulous. It was a rule-based society; killers were punished by law, and no one, no matter how powerful, could escape this. Didn't those people know that?</p><p>"Village Chief, let's set aside the fact that those people never intended to take the lives of the sick villagers in the first place. Even if we consider the worst-case scenario, where someone among them actually died, who would know it was their doing?"</p><p>"But what was their purpose? Revenge?"</p><p>APIOng felt his mind clearly wasn't functioning well enough. They were just discussing a business deal between buyers and sellers, mutual satisfaction for willing transactions, and parting ways if one party didn't agree to sell. Why would this involve something as extreme as murder?</p><p>"Village Chief, they run a company; their goal is profit. They wouldn't resort to such means of revenge because the village refused them. I think they want to use this threat to force compliance from the village."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shared his hypothesis.</p><p>"Think about it: if more and more villagers fall ill with strange diseases and panic spreads, not only would you as Village Chief find it hard to remain stable, but the families of the sick would also be unable to bear it. If someone then stepped forward claiming they could cure the disease, who among the village or their families could refuse?"</p><p>After hearing Zhu Tianlei's words and connecting them with what Assistant Li had said earlier, APIOng punched the table in anger.</p><p>"These damn beasts!"</p><p>APIOng was truly enraged, his face turning pale and his shoulders trembling violently.</p><p>"Village Chief, don't get angry yet. I've already cured the sick villagers, but I'm afraid those people won't be satisfied and might try something else. So, we must think of a way to eliminate the root cause and prevent any future problems!"</p><p>"All of them were cured?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei nod, APIOng's anger, which had nearly driven him mad, subsided slightly.</p><p>"I'll call them!"</p><p>APIOng reached for the phone on the table but was stopped by Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Village Chief, you're being hasty. If a phone call could solve it, none of this would have happened, and Assistant Li wouldn't be making such brazen threats against you!"</p><p>"This matter should not be publicized for now. I will think of a solution. If those people come again, get someone to call me!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pondered for a moment and said slowly.</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Yao Gang, the leader of the village, suddenly felt ashamed of his position as village head just then. For the first time, he experienced feelings of weariness and reluctance. Therefore, he saw nothing wrong with Zhu Tianlei's arrangement but was instead deeply grateful to Zhu Tianlei for stepping forward to help him think of a solution and share the difficulties.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei returned to the clinic, Hao Xinmei had already left. Upon checking his phone, Zhu Tianlei realized that Hao Xinmei had left a message saying there was an urgent matter at work and she had to rush back.</p><p>Ma Lanlan was also absent, likely on a house call.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sat in the chair with his hands behind his head, trying to figure out what he should do. Back at the village office, he had impulsively taken responsibility for the situation, but now that he regretted it, it was too late.</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was feeling frustrated and pulling on his ears in frustration, the phone on the table rang.</p><p>It was an unknown number!</p><p>"Hello, is this Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>"Yes, who are you?"</p><p>There was a two-second silence from the other end before the voice spoke again.</p><p>"You wanted to solve the issue of parasites in Little Black Stream, right? Meet me at Lianggangzi in one hour!"</p><p>The caller hung up quickly, clearly not giving Zhu Tianlei a chance to ask questions or reconsider.</p><p>Who was this person, and how did they know his phone number?</p><p>How did he find out about the parasites in Xiaohexi Stream? He hadn't mentioned this to Yao Gang at all.</p><p>Lianggangzi was a vast wilderness, surrounded by stone cliffs on all sides, with one side being an abrupt cliff. Normally, no one would go there unless absolutely necessary!</p><p>Why had this person invited him to such a place?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei thought of many reasons but found none satisfactory.</p><p>Damn it!</p><p>One couldn't catch a wolf without losing a child; Zhu Tianlei was naturally fearless and didn't know how to write the word for fear.</p><p>Thinking here, Zhu Tianlei left a note for Ma Lanlan and set off for Lianggangzi.</p><p>After his previous cultivation, Zhu Tianlei's speed was astonishing. However, he usually avoided drawing suspicion by not showing it off. Now that there was no one around, he exerted all his strength, running like the wind, and reached Lianggangzi in less than ten minutes.</p><p>Looking around, everything was desolate.</p><p>"Are you Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>Hearing footsteps behind him, Zhu Tianlei slowly turned around. As expected, standing before him was none other than Assistant Li, whom he had met briefly at the village office.</p><p>"Not bad, Assistant Li knows a lot about Hamagou; he even found this place called Lianggangzi. Impressive!"</p><p>"Ha ha, Zhu Tianlei, you're even more impressive! You managed to concoct a healing medicine in just a few days. Your medical skills probably surpass those of many fame-seeking high-level physicians and professors!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression remained unchanged; the other party immediately started praising him and giving compliments, clearly with some ulterior motive.</p><p>"There's no need for Assistant Li to praise me; let's get straight to the point. What did you bring me here to discuss?"</p><p>Assistant Li's face fell; the prepared speech was cut off by Zhu Tianlei's words. The young man before him couldn't be more than twenty years old, but he spoke and acted with remarkable maturity. His aura alone made even someone who had seen all kinds of officials and businessmen feel pressured.</p><p>"Alright, you look like a straightforward person. I won't beat around the bush. I came to you to talk about the parasites in Xiaohexi; you should stay out of it!"</p><p>Indeed!</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"The reason is that you can't handle it! Little brother, you're still young and don't understand much. The stakes involved here are beyond what a mere upstart like you can bear. I'm doing this for your own good!"</p><p>Assistant Li spoke sincerely and persuasively.</p><p>"Thank you for your kind intentions, Assistant Li. However, I fear that you will be disappointed. I, Zhu Tianlei, have made a vow before Village Head Yao and will see this matter through to the end!"</p><p>The words "see it through to the end" were spoken with conviction.</p><p>Assistant Li's expression darkened. He had thought that this young upstart, a country bumpkin from the countryside, would back down after some scare tactics, but he was mistaken. This guy was tough.</p><p>"Little brother, think about it again. I truly have your best interests at heart. If you insist on being obstinate, you'll regret it later!"</p><p>"Oh? Regret it later? Unfortunately, Zhu Tianlei never regrets anything!"</p><p>"You... refusing to take a sip of the wine and choosing the vinegar instead? Come out here all of you!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained motionless, coldly watching as more than ten men wearing black suits and sunglasses emerged from beneath the previously barren cliff.</p><p>Seeing their attire, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but laugh rudely.</p><p>What was this, a movie or a TV drama? It was already overcast with no sun, yet they wore sunglasses. They really knew how to put on an act!</p>

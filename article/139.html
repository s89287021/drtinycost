						<p>"Yún Táo, what's wrong with you?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's smile froze instantly. Had he done something wrong?</p><p>He quickly put down the things in his hands, squatted beside Zhang Yúnguō, and hugged her, feeling incredibly heartbroken.</p><p>"Yúnguō, I'm sorry; it was my fault..."</p><p>Although he didn't know why, making his beloved woman cry made Zhu Tianlei feel like he had failed.</p><p>"No no no, Tianlei, I was just so moved. I really... thought I was the only one left..."</p><p>Zhang Yúnguō's beautiful eyes were swollen red, looking like two walnuts.</p><p>"Stupid woman, today is your birthday! How could I forget?"</p><p>Only then did Zhang Yúnguō look back at the cake. The two Arabic numerals on it were lit up; she was 26 years old but celebrating her first birthday.</p><p>That night was unforgettable for Zhang Yúnguō.</p><p>That night, they indulged in each other intensely.</p><p>That night, the autumn wind howled outside, while inside, spring reigned supreme.</p><p>...</p><p>Three days passed quickly. Apart from the first day being a two-person world, the remaining two days saw workers gradually returning to the factory. Most of them were employees from nearby villages where living conditions weren't as good, and the unit's food was also superior. Naturally, they all wanted to return early.</p><p>On the early morning of the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month, Zhu Tianlei hadn't even gotten out of bed when he was woken up by a phone call.</p><p>"General Manager Zhu, it's bad... something big has happened..."</p><p>The call was from the night guard, Lao Liu, who worked at the factory. In his forties, he was a decent man but tended to exaggerate things, which is why hearing Lao Liu's voice somewhat calmed Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Hey, Lao Liu, take your time and don't rush."</p><p>"Oh Mr. Zhu, come quickly, or our company is going to be ruined..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned; he was not pleased with what Lao Liu said. What kind of words were these? Since its establishment, Tianlei Pharmaceutical had been through so much—why was it still losing its composure?</p><p>"Lao Liu, you..."</p><p>"I can't take it anymore, Mr. Zhu, I'm breaking down..."</p><p>The phone suddenly went to busy tone.</p><p>"Hey, Lao Liu... Hey, hey, hey..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's spirits couldn't help but tense up as well; what was going on?</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Zhu Tianlei had already rushed to the entrance of the company.</p><p>A group of people were gathered around the gate of Tianlei Pharmaceutical. The large signboard lay on the ground, and a woman's miserable cries echoed into the sky.</p><p>"What are you doing here? If you have something to say, just say it... don't break things..."</p><p>Lao Liu's voice.</p><p>"Spit this out, breaking things means nothing! Today, if Zhu Tianlei doesn't give us an explanation, we'll set up a shrine at your gate and see how you keep running your so-called business!"</p><p>A man's voice, crude and rude.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood outside the crowd; although he was still puzzled, he felt somewhat numb.</p><p>Recently, he had no peace of mind.</p><p>However, when his gaze fell on several cameras and DVs in the crowd, his brow involuntarily furrowed; they actually brought media along.</p><p>"Quick, Zhu Tianlei!"</p><p>Someone in the crowd shouted first, and those people immediately rushed over to Zhu Tianlei like bees drawn to nectar.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, have you ever performed emergency treatment on a newborn female infant?"</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, could you describe the process of treating the infant for us?"</p><p>...</p><p>One microphone after another was thrust in front of Zhu Tianlei, and the journalists fired questions at him one after another as if they were firing a machine gun, all of which centered around the treatment of the infant.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei searched his memory; during his clinic sessions at the county hospital, he had not treated any cases of infant emergencies. The only contact he had was with Wu Hongqiang's daughter, but he had only chatted with Wu Hongqiang on WeChat yesterday. Wu Hongqiang even sent him two short videos of Wu Tianen, who was adorable and precocious; there shouldn't be any issues.</p><p>Was it another case of being framed?</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you beast in human form, give me back my daughter's life......"</p><p>At that moment, a disheveled woman rushed forward, crashing into Zhu Tianlei. Before he could react, her hands clutched his neck.</p><p>Her? </p><p>Although the lighting was dim and the woman was covered in blood, Zhu Tianlei quickly identified her.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, I will kill you to avenge my daughter!"</p><p>The woman had great strength; if not for Zhu Tianlei's quick reflexes, she might have strangled him to death.</p><p>Ten cameras pointed at him, dozens of eyes staring intently. Since the situation was unclear, Zhu Tianlei could not take any action; he merely gently grabbed the woman's wrist and effortlessly freed himself from her grasp.</p><p>"What happened to your daughter?"</p><p>After freeing himself, Zhu Tianlei did not run away but stood calmly in place, looking at the woman as he asked.</p><p>"Pah, you have the nerve to ask! Little Douya was killed by this monster. She only lived for 81 days... it's all because of you...... you must pay with your life for Little Douya......."</p><p>A man rushed forward. He had a broad build and an oily face, his voice menacing as if he wanted to tear Zhu Tianlei apart.</p><p>Behind the man stood seven or eight others, clearly part of the same group.</p><p>"I'm asking her."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei maintained a stern expression, ignoring the man and addressing the woman in a low voice.</p><p>"You killed my daughter. If not for you, she would still be alive. You are a murderer, a murderer......."</p><p>The woman lifted her head, her voice trembling, eyes red with tears, even blood trickling from the corners of her mouth.</p><p>"I'm asking you again, what happened to your daughter?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face darkened further, his tone colder.</p><p>"F*cking hell, you dare ask! I'll kill you today and make you pay for Little Douya's death!"</p><p>The oily man was extremely upset at being ignored repeatedly and let out a curse before lunging at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not look away but deftly moved to the side just as the oily man's hand reached him, grabbing the man's wrist in return.</p><p>"Don't anger me further. I'm asking her questions. What happened to your daughter?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was like a tape recorder, repeatedly saying the same sentence. But the power of repetition was terrifying. The woman looked at Zhu Tianlei and let out a horrific scream. She pointed with both hands towards the direction of the factory gate and sobbed again.</p><p>This child had been saved by Zhu Tianlei, so he naturally felt a certain closeness to it. Seeing the child's figure, he walked towards the gate without hesitation.</p>

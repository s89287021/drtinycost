						<p>A bunch of women immediately fell in line with the fat aunt's rhythm, talking back and forth, spouting all sorts of vulgarities. Chen Widow lowered her head and said nothing.</p><p>"Enough, you bunch of women, chatter, chatter, chatter, when will it end?"</p><p>Apo Gang was so annoyed that he shouted out loud.</p><p>"What are you shouting at us for? We didn't sleep with anyone, nor did we kill anyone. If you don’t shout at the murderers, what kind of ability is this to shout at us?"</p><p>Hearing Apo Gang's words, the fat aunt was unhappy and shot back two sentences in response.</p><p>"Village head, do I have something to say that I can't express?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had been standing in the crowd all along. Now he felt it was about time to speak up.</p><p>"Zhu kid, say what you have to say. Uncle and the rest were wrong to misjudge you. We apologize!"</p><p>"What is the village head saying? As the village chief, can’t you ignore reports? Don’t worry, I didn’t take it personally. What I want to say is that Chen Widow is a woman after all, and doing such things might have been a momentary lapse. Since we all live in this village, and neither I nor Uncle Hu are involved, how about letting her off this time?"</p><p>Chen Widow suddenly raised her head, looking at Zhu Tianlei in disbelief. She saw that Zhu Tianlei’s expression was calm and didn’t seem to be lying. A glimmer of hope immediately rose in her heart, but she also felt ashamed, wanting to find a crack in the ground to crawl into.</p><p>Apo Gang didn't expect Zhu Tianlei to say such things. How broad-minded this child was! If it were him, he wouldn’t have spared Chen Widow.</p><p>The villagers also looked at Zhu Tianlei in disbelief. Before, they had always thought that Zhu Tianlei wasn’t capable and was just a troublemaker who annoyed people. But now, Zhu Tianlei seemed to be covered in a layer of gold, shining with a dazzling halo all over him.</p><p>Malan outside the crowd's heart was beating fast. She didn't know what she was feeling, but her eyes were like glue stuck on Zhu Tianlei and wouldn’t move away.</p><p>"Uncle Hu, what do you think?"</p><p>Seeing Apo Gang looking at Hu Daniu, Zhu Tianlei turned to ask Hu Daniu.</p><p>"Alright, Zhu Tianlei's word goes. I have no objections!"</p><p>Hu Daxiu was very decisive. Despite his intense desire to tear Chen Guafu to pieces, he knew that Zhu Tianlei had saved his life, so he wouldn't argue with Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Since that's the case, let's drop this matter then!"</p><p>Seeing that both victims were agreeable, Yao Gang also relaxed. This outcome was indeed satisfactory for everyone.</p><p>Chen Guafu didn't expect that this matter would be brushed off so lightly. Looking at Zhu Tianlei's tall figure, her eyes welled up with tears, and she suddenly kneeled down.</p><p>"Tianlei, I am unworthy of being called your sister. I am worse than an animal. Despite the way I treated you, you still spoke on my behalf. The favor you did for me, I will repay you even if it means working as a cow or horse!"</p><p>The women led by Aunt Fat were all disappointed with this result. They had long hoped to drown that shameless widow in the pond or at least expel her from Toad Ditch Village to avoid her constant flirting with men.</p><p>Although they were disappointed with the outcome, they couldn't voice their dissatisfaction. Seeing Chen Guafu kneeling on the ground and crying with tears streaming down her cheeks, they spat viciously.</p><p>"Forget it, let's move on. Chairman, I'm going home to check on my mom!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said goodbye to Yao Gang, nodded at everyone else, then turned and left the village committee, heading home along a small path.</p><p>The moon had risen high above the treetops, and the evening breeze carried the sweet scent of corn stalks. Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but smile.</p><p>As soon as he got home, Zhu Quezi came out to meet him, his face full of concern.</p><p>"Dad, there's nothing wrong. Hu Daxiu is fine; he just got some scrapes and bruises!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words instantly relieved Zhu Quezi, who had been on edge all day, hoping to go check on the situation at Huludong but unable to leave his wife. Now that he knew everything was alright, his heart finally calmed down.</p><p>"Is Mom still unconscious?"</p><p>"She's awake now, but she started crying and got so exhausted that she fell asleep."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt a tinge of bitterness in his heart, realizing that he had been too naive before, causing his parents to worry about him. However, from today on, Zhu Tianlei would definitely change for the better and start anew.</p><p>Entering the room, he glanced at his mother and checked her carefully, finding that she was indeed heartsick but had no other ailments. Zhu Tianlei finally felt relieved. He grabbed a mouthful of corn grits and lay down on the bed in the west room.</p><p>The moment he closed his eyes, those strange things appeared again in his mind. This time, however, they automatically activated without needing Zhu Tianlei's consciousness to drive them.</p><p>He read line by line and was surprised to discover that each line of text disappeared after he read it, not vanishing into thin air but entering his brain and fusing with his memory.</p><p>So, are there really gods in this world?</p><p>If not, how could the old man explain Zhu Tianlei's sudden possession of medical skills?</p><p>Too many things were vying for his attention, causing Zhu Tianlei headaches. He massaged his temples; too much had happened today, and he was thoroughly exhausted. He decided not to think about it any further!</p><p>This time, Zhu Tianlei fell asleep as soon as he closed his eyes.</p><p>The next morning, Zhu Tianlei was awakened by a pleasant aroma.</p><p>"Leizi, your mom made egg soup for you. Hurry up and drink it while it's hot! Look how skinny you've become!"</p><p>Hou Suqin woke up in the middle of the night and came to check on her son. She wouldn't feel at ease until she saw him with her own eyes. Then early the next morning, before dawn, she got up to start a fire and cook, making eight eggs for her son and boiling a large pot of egg soup.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at his mother, feeling his nose turn sour, pitiful of all parents' hearts. This time, he had survived a great danger and even gained benefits from it. He would definitely take good care of his parents.</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei finished drinking the egg soup, voices could be heard from the courtyard. He listened carefully.</p><p>"Old Zhu's big brother, I have no choice but to come beg you for help. My wife is in labor, and she hasn't given birth after one day and night. The midwife said that if we delay any longer, it will result in a double tragedy!"</p><p>The voice sounded somewhat familiar. Upon careful consideration, he recognized it as Tan Daqquan from the eastern end of the village.</p><p>Zhu Quezi, on the other hand, was completely bewildered. Did Tan Daquean not wake up this morning? Why did his daughter-in-law come to him for help?</p><p>"Uncle Tan, maybe you came to the wrong place," he said.</p><p>Zhu Quezi didn't want to directly say, "Are you still asleep? Are you confused?"</p><p>"Big Brother, right now only your son Lei can save my daughter-in-law and grandson. I beg you on my knees!"</p>

						<p>In front of the small hill was a field of persimmon trees, but after Tianlei Pharmaceutical occupied it, the orchard had been abandoned. However, persimmons still continued to grow abundantly.</p><p>Although it was winter, some persimmons remained on the trees, hanging dry and shriveled. Zhang Yuntao told Xiao Gangpeng that these persimmons, dried by the sun on the trees, were natural persimmon cakes. To his surprise, Xiao Gangpeng insisted on eating them.</p><p>Unable to resist Xiao Gangpeng's pleas, Zhang Yuntao picked several persimmons from the tree. However, due to wind and sun exposure, a layer of dust covered the dry persimmons. Zhang Yuntao asked Xiao Gangpeng to follow her to the water room to wash the dry persimmons, but Xiao Gangpeng insisted on staying at the small hill to play.</p><p>Thinking that they were inside Tianlei Pharmaceutical and the water room was not far from the small hill, Zhang Yuntao went alone to the water room to wash the dry persimmons. To her horror, when she returned, she saw Xiao Gangpeng clutching his neck with a face turned purple, and half-eaten dry persimmons on the ground.</p><p>Panicked, Zhang Yuntao immediately picked up Xiao Gangpeng and ran downhill, intending to find Zhu Tianlei. Just as they reached the backyard warehouse, she discovered that Xiao Gangpeng had rolled his eyes back and was lifeless.</p><p>Recalling some first aid methods she had seen on television, she laid Xiao Gangpeng down on the ground, pressed her hand against his chest, and performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.</p><p>To her disbelief, Chen Fanglin suddenly appeared, saw her performing CPR on Xiao Gangpeng, and insisted that she was killing him. As a result, Xiao Gangpeng truly died.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao could not accept this blow and thus lost control of her emotions.</p><p>After hearing Zhang Yuntao's account, a cold look flashed in Zhu Tianlei's eyes.</p><p>Could persimmon cakes cause Xiao Gangpeng to suffocate?</p><p>No way!</p><p>As soon as the car arrived, Zhang Yuntao saw a large crowd gathered at the entrance of the auditorium.</p><p>The moment Zhu Tianlei got out of the car, the crowd immediately stirred.</p><p>Yang Wenjie and Deng Chang got out of the car one after another.</p><p>Among the crowd, many people had seen Yang Wenjie before, while some recognized Deng Chang. They did not expect that this case would involve both the county mayor and the city mayor.</p><p>There was still a desire to engage in idle gossip, but upon seeing Yang Wenjie and Deng Chang, everyone tactfully closed their mouths. Zhu Tianlei called for several male employees, who carried Yang Zhongmin into the grand hall. Xiao Gangpeng's corpse lay quietly on the marble floor of the grand hall, which was smooth as a mirror but chilling to the touch. Xiao Gangpeng's mother sat beside him, her eyes still vacant. "Put the body next to Xiao Gangpeng!" As soon as Zhu Tianlei finished speaking, several workers laid Zhang Zhongmin's obese body down on the floor. "Sister, this is Mayor Yang, and this is County Magistrate Deng." Zhu Tianlei approached the woman and spoke softly. The woman turned her head, taking a long time to regain focus. "Where are the enemies you mentioned?" It seemed she didn't hear Zhu Tianlei's words, only asking blankly. Zhu Tianlei's nose tingled slightly. How could he not understand this mother's feelings? Having merely spent a month with Xiao Gangpeng, he himself was unable to express his inner pain; how much more so would it be for this mother who had endured ten months of pregnancy and five years of hard work nurturing Xiao Gangpeng? "Sister, please sit up first. The floor is cold, and you still need to arrange Xiao Gangpeng's funeral. No matter what, you cannot collapse." Although such consolation was pale, it was the most suitable thing Zhu Tianlei could think of at the moment. After speaking, Ma Lanlan and Zhang Yuntao by his side quickly reached out to pull Xiao Gangpeng's mother up from the ground. Due to sitting for too long, the woman's legs had gone numb, and even with assistance, she almost fell.</p><p>Mayor Yang, Mayor Deng, I, Zhu Tianlei, have never been someone who makes up things and is unreasonable. But look, do you see the little boy lying on the ground? It was arranged by Yang Zhongmin to take this child's life. Mayor Yang, you might remember the short video I sent you from the quarantine area; that little boy dancing and singing was him!</p><p>Yang Wenjie's body trembled.</p><p>During the quarantine period, in order to report the progress of the patients' conditions and their lives in the quarantine area in a timely manner, Zhu Tianlei almost always sent several short videos to Yang Wenjie and Tang Wen.</p><p>One segment was of Xiao Gangpeng dancing "Little Apple" before his recovery.</p><p>"Tianlei, I understand your feelings, but this matter involves the deputy county mayor of a county. We cannot rush to judgment without any evidence!"</p><p>Yang Wenjie said after thinking for a moment.</p><p>"Of course, even if he wants to rush to judgment, I won't let Xiao Gangpeng die without knowing what happened."</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei walked toward Yang Zhongmin.</p><p>Yang Zhongmin had been sleeping for nearly an hour.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced disdainfully at the wet part of Yang Zhongmin's pants cuff.</p><p>A person with evil intentions but no courage to act on them.</p><p>He pulled out a silver needle and shot it into Yang Zhongmin's neck. The originally closed eyes of Yang Zhongmin groaned, then slowly opened.</p><p>In front of him was Zhu Tianlei's magnified face.</p><p>"Are we going to hell together?"</p><p>Yang Zhongmin's vision was still somewhat blurred, and apart from Zhu Tianlei, he couldn't see anything else at the moment.</p><p>"Only those who have done wrong will go to hell."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pulled up the corner of his mouth and gave a cold laugh.</p><p>"Pah, Zhu Tianlei, what are you boasting about? No matter how great you are, aren’t we both going to end up in hell anyway?"</p><p>A calamity seemed to have not made Yang Zhongmin any smarter; instead, it had only made him more foolish and ridiculous.</p><p>As his vision gradually restored, Yang Zhongmin realized the situation within a range of about three or four meters from himself. He suddenly remembered that he wasn’t dead, but when he tried to relax, he saw Xiao Gangbeng’s corpse lying beside him, which immediately scared him into screaming.</p><p>Xiao Gangbeng’s eyes were originally closed, but for some reason, they were now open. Although there are no ghosts in the world, everyone present took a deep breath at that moment.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you......you actually put me with this corpse, you......"</p><p>"At midnight, one does not do wicked deeds; at midnight, one is not afraid of ghostly knocks on the door. County Mayor Yang was so scared by a child’s corpse; it seems he has done many wicked deeds indeed!"</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, what do you want?"</p><p>"That should be asked of Xiao Gangbeng!"</p><p>"You......what do you mean......"</p><p>"What do I mean? Doesn’t County Mayor Yang want to know how Xiao Gangbeng died?"</p><p>"Pah pah pah, how he died has nothing to do with me. Zhu Tianlei, let me tell you, I am the deputy county mayor of Daheshan County. No matter how great you are, you dare not set up a private court and deal with me. Even Yang Wenjie does not have this authority!"</p>

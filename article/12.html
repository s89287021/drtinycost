						<p>"Mr. Secretary Yang's kindness I have taken to heart, but as a doctor, my duty is merely to save lives and heal wounds. The city has hospitals equipped with medical facilities and many highly skilled doctors; one less of me would make no difference. However, Hamaogou Village is different. Treating patients is the same anywhere, so I am sorry!"</p><p>Apo Gang almost wanted to applaud Zhu Tianlei. While he was excited, he also made a silent decision to send Zhu Tianlei to work at the village clinic when they returned. His salary would be twice, no, three times higher than Ma Lanlan's!</p><p>The other two young women in the room looked at this composed and calm man, facing his future and power with composure, with an extremely gentle and admiring gaze.</p><p>"Are you not going to reconsider?"</p><p>Li Yong sincerely hoped that someone as skilled as Zhu Tianlei could join the city hospital and become his colleague.</p><p>"Really, thank you, Dr. Li!"</p><p>Although Li Yong felt a bit disappointed, he respected everyone's wishes. Since the other party was unwilling, he couldn't force it, though he still wasn't entirely convinced.</p><p>"This is my business card. If Brother Little changes his mind or needs anything, just give me a call!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't refuse and accepted the business card with a smile. In life, more friends meant more paths, and more so, if he wanted to make something of himself and provide a better life for his parents, he needed to expand his network.</p><p>"Mr. Yang has just woken up and is still very weak. It would be best for him to rest at home for two days and keep his diet light these few days."</p><p>After finishing his instructions, Zhu Tianlei was about to leave. In truth, he wanted to stay, but sometimes, rushing things could lead to failure. Yang Xiaoxue's attitude towards him had clearly changed just now, and he couldn't afford to let the opportunity slip away.</p><p>"Tianlei, I...I still feel a bit unwell. Why don't you check on me again?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't expect Yang Xiaoxue to say this. In fact, he had already checked her; apart from feeling weak, she had no other issues. The power of the purple orchid medicinal pill was indeed formidable.</p><p>But since Yang Xiaoxue had requested it, Zhu Tianlei wasn't stupid and knew there was no reason to refuse.</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression remained composed, though his heart was in turmoil.</p><p>"Dad, you go rest first. I'll go wash up and change my clothes."</p><p>Yang Dong saw that his daughter was okay and breathed a sigh of relief. Indeed, throughout the journey, his heart had been pounding, and he had been extremely tense. Now that he could relax, he felt quite tired.</p><p>"Tianlei, please wait for me a moment!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue glanced at Zhu Tianlei. Hearing her call him Tianlei made Zhu Tianlei's heart flutter with joy. The kind of alluring look only a woman can give made Zhu Tianlei feel a surge of heat in his lower body.</p><p>Sun Bilian and Yao Gang chatted for a bit more before heading back home. Only Ma Lanlan stood there, staring intently at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>This man was like a jade gem suddenly free of dust, radiating brilliance even under dim lighting.</p><p>"Lan, darling, what are you looking at so intently?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had long noticed Ma Lanlan's gaze and couldn't help feeling elated when he thought about how she had previously looked down on him. Now, her look made him feel even more confident.</p><p>Lost in her own world, Ma Lanlan was startled by Zhu Tianlei's sudden voice and blushed deeply. Seeing his gaze lingering on her chest made her feel both embarrassed and indignant.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you pervert!"</p><p>"Pervert? Heh heh, but you were looking at me with such fascination. You're a female pervert, just right for me!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan's gaze had boosted Zhu Tianlei's confidence, so he didn't worry about how she would react to his words.</p><p>"You...you rogue!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words made Ma Lanlan's heart race like a drum. She felt the room was burning hot enough to roast her and, after giving a soft rebuke, hurriedly ran out of the door without lingering.</p><p>Her round, full bottom wrapped in a black slim-fit shorts seemed about to burst out, causing Zhu Tianlei to lick his slightly dry lips.</p><p>"Tiānlěi, sorry to keep you waiting so long."</p><p>Zhu Tiānlěi stared at Yang Xiaoxue, who had walked in through the back door. He swallowed several times, feeling tongue-tied.</p><p>At that moment, Yang Xiaoxue's hair was still damp from washing and fell over her shoulders. She wore a white dress that, although simple and not revealing, seemed to offer no barrier to the prominent peaks beneath it. Her snow-white legs peeked out from under the dress.</p><p>Every inch of her skin was like a blooming snow lotus, sacred yet irresistibly enticing.</p><p>"It's fine; waiting for such a beauty as Professor Yang is worth any amount of time!"</p><p>Zhu Tiānlěi squinted his eyes and said with a grin, completely different from his earlier solemn and serious demeanor.</p><p>"Smooth talker!"</p><p>"Pardon me, Dr. Zhu!"</p><p>Though she knew Yang Xiaoxue's words were teasing, Zhu Tiānlěi still felt a surge of pride.</p><p>"It is my honor to serve beauties!"</p><p>Zhu Tiānlěi placed his hand on Yang Xiaoxue's wrist, but his eyes couldn't help glancing repeatedly at her chest. He hadn't expected that despite her innocent appearance, she had such an alluring figure, and the feel of those precious hands must be exquisite.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, how is your pulse diagnosis coming along?"</p><p>Although Yang Xiaoxue was just out of college, her good looks and numerous admirers meant she wasn't ignorant about matters of love. Thus, she could guess what Zhu Tiānlěi was looking at, if not even thinking.</p><p>But, she was not averse to it.</p><p>"Cough... Mr. Yang's pulse is steady and calm, with strong beats, indicating no major health issues."</p><p>These medical terms came naturally from Zhu Tianlei's mouth, and Yang Xiaoxue blinked her eyelashes at him, suddenly bursting into laughter.</p><p>"Why is Mr. Yang laughing?"</p><p>"Nothing, I thought you were a lecherous scoundrel before, but turns out you're a divine doctor. If not for you today, I would be dead. How should I thank you?"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue's red lips curved slightly when she smiled, revealing two sharp little canine teeth, which made Zhu Tianlei feel a heat rising in his lower abdomen.</p><p>"How about offering your body to me?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei chuckled, and Yang Xiaoxue's face flushed red. Just as she was about to stand up, she realized her wrist was still in Zhu Tianlei's hand and tried to break free. However, the chair beneath her suddenly tipped over for some reason, causing both of them to fall onto the ground.</p><p>"Mmm... so fragrant!"</p>

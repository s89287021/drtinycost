						<p>"The idea of handcrafted pharmaceuticals is excellent. In today's era of highly advanced machinery, traditional craftsmanship has become all the more precious and valuable. I do not oppose handcrafted pharmaceuticals, but we are a business, and our purpose is to generate profits. We are not solely focused on promoting Traditional Chinese Medicine or glorifying handmade manufacturing; those are tasks for scientists, not entrepreneurs."</p><p>Mao Yu rarely spoke such long stretches of words. In fact, before making this decision, she had wrestled with the idea in her mind, but since she had agreed to be a business consultant for Tianlei Pharmaceutical, she must consider the future of the company.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained silent.</p><p>Mao Yu also fell silent.</p><p>It was unclear how long it took, but the stifling air made breathing feel increasingly laborious.</p><p>"I know what you are thinking. You have always wanted to help the villagers become prosperous, and I do not oppose that. Moreover, procurement of equipment and handcrafted pharmaceuticals are not entirely in conflict!"</p><p>Hearing Mao Yu's words, Zhu Tianlei's eyes regained their sparkle.</p><p>Mao Yu couldn't help but smile bitterly; Zhu Tianlei's mood was truly unpredictable!</p><p>"We can retain both production methods. For high-demand, low-profit drugs, we will use machine processing, while for low-demand, strictly processed, and high-profit drugs, we will use handcrafted manufacturing. This way, we ensure the profitability of the pharmaceutical factory while also fulfilling your wish to help the villagers become prosperous."</p><p>"Alright, let's do it this way!"</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>A week later, two floors of the factory building had already been completed.</p><p>Looking at the buildings rising like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but marvel at the greatness of human endeavor and the magic of modern architectural technology.</p><p>"Boss, it's bad! A worker fell from the truss and has fainted!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei jumped up and immediately ran towards the construction site without stopping to ask any questions.</p><p>At that moment, there was a crowd of people gathered beneath the truss. Upon seeing Zhu Tianlei approaching, they scattered. On the ground lay a man in his thirties, with his eyes tightly closed, and blood pooling under one of his legs.</p><p>"Boss, please take a look! This guy isn't breathing!"</p><p>A worker, clearly shocked, had a pale face.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei squatted down with a stern expression, feeling the pulse at the injured man's wrist. His brows immediately furrowed.</p><p>"Can you help me carry him to the foot of Fangshan? Be careful, don't touch his leg."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei directed several workers to use planks as stretchers, carrying the injured worker to the wall corner. He took out some silver needles from his pocket and quickly pricked around the wound to stop the bleeding.</p><p>Most of these workers knew about Zhu Tianlei's deeds but had never seen them with their own eyes. Now, they witnessed as Zhu Tianlei's silver needles landed on the man's leg, and the once bleeding wound truly stopped gushing blood.</p><p>"Unbutton his clothes and bring me a basin of cold water."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei gave a series of orders, and soon a worker brought over a basin of water. Zhu Tianlei used some of the cool water to pat the injured man's chest and forehead before continuing to needle him.</p><p>At this moment, there was a commotion under the beam.</p><p>"Get out of the way, get out of the way! Where is my brother?"</p><p>A man's voice echoed. Zhu Tianlei was in the middle of needling and did not respond to the questioner. To him, the patient's safety was more important than anything else, especially since this patient was a worker constructing his factory. Ethically and logically, he could not shirk his responsibility.</p><p>"Brother?"</p><p>The previous voice sounded again. Zhu Tianlei did not turn around but sensed someone lunging at him from behind. This was a construction site filled with building materials, and he was treating an injured person. Zhu Tianlei slightly bent over, unwilling to engage in conflict with the other person.</p><p>"Where is my brother? Brother!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not expect this person to be so persistent, so without any preparation, he was pushed to the side by the other party. An overweight middle-aged man instantly pounced on the injured person.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took a cold look and saw that there were still more than ten similarly built men standing behind the man.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was no longer the idle person from before; he could see right away that these people had come prepared, and their goal was clearly to deal with him. However, the means they would use remained unclear.</p><p>The injured person on the ground had indeed fallen unconscious due to a fall from a great height, causing asphyxia, shock, and minor internal injuries.</p><p>"Who is the boss? Step forward!"</p><p>After roaring a few times, the man suddenly stood up and asked fiercely.</p><p>"I am."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said coolly. The workers around him involuntarily shrank back; their boss seemed well-mannered and spoke politely, clearly not a match for the other side.</p><p>"What happened to my brother? He was fine when he left home, now he's lying here half-dead. What happened?"</p><p>The man grabbed Zhu Tianlei by his collar and shouted.</p><p>"He fell from the truss during construction. I am treating him."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained calm.</p><p>"My brother has been doing construction for over ten years; he's never had any accidents before, not even a scratch on his finger. How could he fall? Hmph, you must be lying, hiding the truth!"</p><p>Although the man was tall and strong, it was clear that he wasn't unintelligent; his logic was very sound.</p><p>"Brother, Zhang Qiang did indeed fall by himself. We all saw it happen; it has nothing to do with the boss......"</p><p>At the beginning, the worker who reported the incident could no longer watch idly. After all, Zhu Tianlei had treated them well; he was always friendly and not to mention sharing cigarettes, alcohol, and fruits with everyone. That's why he stepped forward wanting to say a fair word.</p><p>"You think you're something? When I asked him, what nonsense did you spout? Get lost!"</p><p>Without hesitation, this person pushed the worker in the chest, and the worker, unprepared for any physical assault, was thrust back two or three meters. With a thud, he hit the brick wall, causing the bricks to violently shake from the impact, scaring the worker so much that his face turned ashen.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, who originally had no intention of fighting, saw the worker trying to speak on his behalf being punched and sent flying by the other party. His anger flared up instantly. In the moment he was freeing himself, he grabbed the collar of the other person's shirt and lifted him off the ground, despite the man being a tall 1.8-meter giant.</p>

						<p>As soon as I entered the room, I felt a sense of oppression. Wei Baoguo, who usually held himself in high regard, stood in the middle of the room, while Zhanrouzhou, although seated, had an awkward posture. Mayor Yang's face was extremely grim.</p><p>Tang Wen's heart inexplicably tightened.</p><p>"Vice President Tang, from now on, you will temporarily take over as Acting President of the City Hospital. You must carefully handle the prevention and control of infectious diseases, establish a specialized treatment and prevention team, and I have already chosen the leader for this group, Zhu Tianlei."</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Tang Wen was somewhat dazed by Yang Wanjie's sudden burst of words. He was to be made Acting President, responsible for disease prevention and control, and to form an epidemic control team. Most importantly, Zhu Tianlei was not a doctor at the City Hospital; in fact, he had heard that Zhu Tianlei wasn't even a proper doctor. What was going on now?</p><p>When Wei Baoguo heard the name Zhu Tianlei, his eyes immediately lit up as if a hawk had smelled prey in the dark.</p><p>He then clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>"Yes, I will contact Zhu Tianlei right away and definitely fulfill Mayor Yang's trust!"</p><p>Tang Wen was a smart man. Although he completely didn't understand what was happening, he caught two important pieces of information from Yang Wanjie's words: first, Wei Baoguo had committed some mistake, so the mayor had punished him, hence Tang Wen's opportunity to be Acting President; second, and equally importantly, Mayor Yang placed great importance on Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Acting President, though it still included "acting," who could say he wouldn't have a chance to remove those two words? He was about the same age as Wei Baoguo. These years, Wei Baoguo had held the position of President like a fortress; Tang Wen thought he would never have a chance in his lifetime. Who knew that fate would throw him such an opportunity?</p><p>He wasn't stupid. Not seizing such a good chance would be foolish!</p><p>With Yang Wanjie's intervention, the City Hospital's infectious disease treatment and prevention team was quickly established. Although it was kept confidential, this matter could not be hidden from the hospital staff.</p><p>In a short time, the entire hospital atmosphere became tense.</p><p>The space of the emergency center was limited, so Tang Wen paid great attention to Zhu Tianlei, almost obeying him blindly. When Zhu Tianlei merely requested expanding the area of the locked-off emergency section, Tang Wen cleared out the entire exchange experimental hall, five floors with over two hundred rooms.</p><p>Li Ping and other medical staff members who had been previously isolated were merged into Zhu Tianlei's group at the same time, while another five emergency patients were admitted to the isolation zone.</p><p>Since Mayor Yang personally directed and took charge, Tang Wen paid even more attention to Zhu Tianlei and solemnly promised him that all resources of the City Hospital would be at Zhu Tianlei's disposal, including himself.</p><p>In the isolation ward, in addition to the eight patients who moved in one after another, there were seven doctors, including Li Ping and Li Yong, and sixteen nurses, including Zhao Xin. When Zhao Xin first entered the hospital, it was during the nns virus outbreak. Although she did not personally participate in the intense battle against the infectious disease, she thoroughly studied the entire treatment and protection procedures later on. She never expected that several years later, she would have the opportunity to put them into practice.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had not slept for three consecutive days as the patients' conditions fluctuated. In particular, the middle-aged man who was the first to fall ill remained unconscious since being taken to the emergency center. Zhu Tianlei administered an injection to him almost every hour.</p><p>At the same time, he frantically researched the characteristics of these patients' illnesses, hoping to find the cause. However, several days passed without any breakthroughs.</p><p>The number of patients continued to increase, and by day five, there were over twenty patients in the isolation ward's rooms. Their ages also varied widely, with the oldest being a sixty-nine-year-old grandmother and the youngest a five-year-old boy named Xiao Gangcong.</p><p>Moreover, some of the nurses who initially participated in the emergency response began to show signs of infection.</p><p>That afternoon, after administering an injection to Xiao Gangcong, Li Yong rushed into the ward from outside.</p><p>"Tianlei, it's bad! Lu Guang has passed away!"</p><p>Lu Guang was the first patient admitted with symptoms, and his name was found in the medical records. Since he never regained consciousness, there was no other information about him besides his name.</p><p>Hearing this news, Zhu Tianlei's heart sank.</p><p>Had his worst fears come true?</p><p>Without hesitation, Zhu Tianlei bolted out of the room and rushed to Lu Guang's side. Sure enough, Lu Guang's pulse was weak, almost nonexistent, but he was not dead.</p><p>"He's still alive."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Li Yong looked at Zhu Tianlei in shock. All the numbers on the medical instruments had returned to zero, indicating that there were no signs of life. Human diagnoses can be inaccurate, but machines do not lie.</p><p>"Tianlei, I know you don't want to accept this, and neither do I. But reality is what it is. We have to face..."</p><p>"Quick, take out your phone and turn on the video function!"</p><p>Li Yong was formulating his words in his mind to gently console Zhu Tianlei. Hearing Zhu Tianlei's sudden remark, he was taken aback but instinctively followed his instructions.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei reached out and forcefully pressed on Lu Guang's chest, then a silver needle was directly inserted into Lu Guang's heart.</p><p>The heart is the most vulnerable part of the human body; no one would dare to easily stab it with a needle. Didn't Zhu Tianlei know this? Or was he under some kind of shock...</p><p>"Lu Guang, if you have anything you want to say, just go ahead!"</p><p>Li Yong opened his mouth in disbelief as he stared at Lu Guang's open eyes. The readings on the instrument were really zero; he was an atheist, but how could he explain what was happening?</p><p>Lu Guang glanced blankly at Zhu Tianlei and Li Yong, then suddenly seemed to sense something.</p><p>"Doctor, am I going to die?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded, unable to lie to someone who was about to die.</p><p>"Oh!"</p><p>Lu Guang did not show any sign of shock; instead, he faintly smiled with the corners of his mouth turned up.</p><p>"I know you have a few sons. If there's anything you want to say, hurry and tell me. Time is running out!"</p><p>With that said, Zhu Tianlei pointed at the phone in Li Yong's hand.</p><p>"Gen'er, your father is dying. You must take good care of your brothers. I put the savings under the cushion in the cabinet. Though it's not much, it will be enough for you to live on for a few months. Your father bought insurance for all of you secretly. If something happens to him, you will receive some money. Then go find that insurance salesman and collect it..."</p><p>Lu Guang spoke slowly, not only because he was sick but also because he was naturally a gentle person.</p><p>"You must study hard. No matter what happens, do not stop going to school. Otherwise, your father will not be at peace in the afterlife. Gen'er, take good care of your brothers and don't think about me. I'll always be watching over you from above..."</p>

						<p>"Mr. Wenjie, thank heavens for this young brother today! If it weren't for him, I would have died in this vehicle!"</p><p>Old Ma pointed at Zhu Tianlei and told Wu Pingjian.</p><p>Wu Pingjian turned to look at Zhu Tianlei; he was young and dressed plainly, making it impossible to discern anything special about him. However, since Old Ma had said so much, he felt compelled to be courteous.</p><p>"Oh my, young man, I truly appreciate your help! Could you please tell me where you are from and what your name is? Once we return to the city, I will make sure to properly reward you."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was unperturbed. He had never imagined that the old man he had inadvertently saved would be someone of such mysterious importance. However, he also wasn't particularly moved by Wu Pingjian's words.</p><p>"It was merely a small favor. Mayor Wu, you are overstating it. There is no need for any reward. If Mayor Wu truly wishes to do something, why not arrange two more buses for Hama Gou? Had the vehicle not been cramped and severely overloaded, causing poor air circulation, this old man would not have fallen ill. Moreover, the drivers must be reliable!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei finished speaking and gave a faint glance at Li Dongkui, who had already gone wide-eyed.</p><p>"This......"</p><p>Wu Pingjian was somewhat hesitant; currently, the city took an individual contracting approach for rural-urban bus routes. Apart from a few administrative villages directly operated by the city's public transportation company, the rest were privately run, including Hama Gou.</p><p>"Pingjian, this young man makes a valid point. Can you see to it?"</p><p>"Yes, Old Ma has spoken. It will be done, no matter what obstacles we face. I will arrange for it immediately upon returning!"</p><p>Hearing these words, Zhu Tianlei's mood improved slightly; after all, he had been advocating for his fellow villagers' welfare!</p><p>He never imagined that besides healing and saving lives, his medical skills could create such value!</p><p>Since Wu Pingjian arrived, Old Ma naturally couldn't take the bus anymore. Both Old Ma and Wu Pingjian sincerely invited Zhu Tianlei to get out of the car and ride in a jeep to Yundai City.</p><p>However, Zhu Tianlei didn't want to appear more favored because he had saved someone, so he politely declined. Moreover, what kind of benefit would there be from having a beautiful woman massage his back in the jeep?</p><p>Old Ma repeatedly asked about Wu Tianlei's name and home address, but Zhu Tianlei laughed it off each time. Helpless, Old Ma left a phone number for Zhu Tianlei before leaving, insisting that he call him when convenient.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't refuse and casually put the phone number in his pocket.</p><p>The car started up again. After the earlier incident, everyone on the bus looked at Zhu Tianlei with complex expressions, but there was more admiration and gratitude than anything else.</p><p>Gradually, some of the older ladies began to talk to Zhu Tianlei, and their conversation eventually turned to matchmaking.</p><p>"Young man, you're so young and have such skilled medical skills. Do you have a girlfriend? If not, Auntie can introduce you to someone who is guaranteed to be beautiful and has a nice butt!"</p><p>A woman in her late forties said chattering away, Zhu Tianlei raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"Why does it matter if she has a big butt?"</p><p>"Haha, a big butt means more sons! You, child, look like you've never even touched a woman!"</p><p>Everyone on the bus laughed along, creating a joyful atmosphere.</p><p>"Who says I'm inexperienced? My wife is right here beside me. By saying this, aren't you trying to stir up trouble between my little couple? Right, Wife?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei poked Yang Xiaoxue's snow-white face. The girl was clearly upset or scared because she had been frowning ever since the car started moving again, without a trace of a smile.</p><p>"Who is your wife?"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue felt extremely irritated. This Zhu Tianlei was heartless—didn't he know how worried she was? He just kept talking to everyone around him and didn't care about her at all.</p><p>"Hehe, you, I've seen you, touched you, even licked you. If you don't marry me, who else would?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shamelessly pressed his mouth to Yang Xiaoxue's ear, sending a warm breath that tickled her ear. Yang Xiaoxue blushed deeply from embarrassment. This action was seen by others as the newlyweds bantering and teasing each other, causing another burst of laughter in the car.</p><p>Because of Zhu Tianlei’s heroic intervention midway, the vehicle arrived at Yunhai City an hour late.</p><p>"Xiaoxue, I have some things to take care of. You go ahead and pack your luggage. Let's meet here at two o'clock this afternoon. How does that sound?"</p><p>After getting out of the car, Zhu Tianlei spoke first.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue originally wanted Zhu Tianlei to accompany her, but since he had spoken first, she felt awkward about saying anything else. Though reluctant, she nodded her head in agreement.</p><p>The two made a brief arrangement and then went their separate ways.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the flower hong inside his handbag. This little thing was either so full it had passed out or something; it remained completely still after being cooped up in the car for such a long time. Had he not seen its belly moving up and down, he would have thought this brat was dead!</p><p>He reached into his pocket to take out the golden business card, looked at the road signs near the station, and then started walking towards the city center.</p><p>"Golden Crown Building."</p><p>About half an hour later, Zhu Tianlei stood in front of a thirty-story commercial building. He checked the address on the card and confirmed it was correct.</p><p>"Hey, what do you do here?"</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was about to enter, he was stopped by a security guard at the entrance.</p><p>"Oh, I’m here to see someone—Manager Hao Xinmei from Meixing Pharmaceutical Company!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei explained his purpose and then tried to go inside. However, the security guard stopped him again.</p><p>"You can only go in if I let you in. You say you’re looking for Manager Hao? Well, do you have an appointment?"</p><p>"I’m her friend. She said I could come over whenever."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't lie. Hao Xinmei did indeed say this.</p><p>"Friend? Listen, I don't mean to look down on you, but what kind of status does Director Hao have? She is one of the Three Golden Flowers of Yunhai City and the General Manager of Meixing Pharmaceutical. She is also one of Yunhai City's top ten young entrepreneurs. There are so many people who want to get close to Director Hao every day, but none of them are like you..."</p>

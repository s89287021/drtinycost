						<p>Beside her, the young man had one arm around her shoulder, his eyebrows slightly raised, with gentle lines on his face. Morning light filtered through, casting a golden glow over him.</p><p>Suddenly, the woman's eyelashes fluttered lightly, then her eyes snapped open wide. Her black eyes gazed out the window as she shouted in regret.</p><p>"Hehe, it's still early, my lady!"</p><p>"Get lost, you impudent fool!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue pouted her rosy lips and glared at Zhu Tianlei before rushing to the basin in the corner of the room. The water was already there; Yang Xiaoxue splashed some onto her face, not bothering to brush her teeth. She grabbed two pieces of gum from her backpack and rushed out of the door.</p><p>Watching Yang Xiaoxue's slender figure leave, Zhu Tianlei smiled and shook his head. This girl sure had a fiery spirit.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei washed his face quickly too and stepped out of the courtyard. He glanced around; luckily, it was still early, and most villagers hadn't left yet. Otherwise, if he were caught, things would be awkward.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei returned home, Hou Suqin was watering the vegetables in the courtyard. She jumped when she saw her son come inside.</p><p>Seeing his room door closed, she thought her son had woken up and was being extra quiet to avoid waking him. But it turned out he wasn't even in the room.</p><p>"Hehe, mom, good morning!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei greeted Hou Suqin before trying to sneak back into his room.</p><p>"Tianlei, stop right there!"</p><p>Hou Suqin threw down her hose, wiped her hands, and walked over from the cement railing by the garden. She approached Zhu Tianlei step by step.</p><p>"Mum, what's wrong? Let me help you water the garden!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei tried to head into the courtyard, but he felt guilty like a thief caught in the act. He didn't know how to lie to his mother, but at this point, his relationship with Yang Xiaoxue wasn't ready to be revealed; she was still an unmarried maiden!</p><p>The sun rose high, bathing the room in golden light that filtered through the window and landed on the bamboo bed. The young woman's eyes were serene, her lips curved into a soft smile as she slept deeply.</p><p>Beside her, the young man had one arm around her shoulder, his eyebrows slightly raised in concentration, with smooth lines adorning his face. The morning light shimmered over him, casting a golden glow.</p><p>Suddenly, the woman's eyelashes fluttered lightly, then her eyes snapped open wide. Her dark eyes scanned the window and she let out a regretful shout.</p><p>"Hehe, it’s still early, my lady!"</p><p>"Get lost, you impudent fool!"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue pouted her rosy lips and glared at Zhu Tianlei before rushing to the basin in the corner of the room.

He didn't know how to lie to his mother, but at this point, his relationship with Yang Xiaoxue wasn't ready to be revealed; she was still an unmarried maiden!</p><p>The first light of dawn illuminated the room, casting a golden hue through the window and onto the bamboo bed. The young woman's eyes were serene, her lips curved into a soft smile as she slept deeply.</p><p>Beside her, the young man had one arm around her shoulder, his eyebrows slightly raised in concentration, with smooth lines adorning his face.

He didn't know how to lie to his mother, but at this point, his relationship with Yang Xiaoxue wasn't ready to be revealed; she was still an unmarried maiden!</p><p>"Don't interrupt, tell me, what were you doing out so early?"</p><p>Damn!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was mentally cursing himself; his mother was going to keep at it.</p><p>"I went for a workout. I've been busy lately and felt unwell, so I went for a run."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's skill in making up stories had always been top-notch.</p><p>There were no surveillance cameras in He Maogou, so there was no way his mother could verify it.</p><p>"Do you think I'm stupid? You've always been lazy since you were little; you don't even get out of bed unless someone beats your butt. Could you really go running? Tell me the truth, what did you do?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned. His mother's intelligence seemed to be declining with age!</p><p>"Mom, I really went for a run. Look, I'm still sweating. I hurried inside to change clothes; otherwise, I might catch a cold and you'd worry!"</p><p>Saying that, Zhu Tianlei made a break for it, quickly climbing the steps and entering the house in an instant. Through the curtain, he saw his mother fuming in the courtyard. Zhu Tianlei touched his own chest.</p><p>Afraid his mother would ask more questions, Zhu Tianlei didn't even have breakfast; he took two remaining sanhe bao from the cupboard the night before and left through the back door. After some thought, he headed straight for Xiaohei Stream.</p><p>This time, Zhu Tianlei put in all his effort, so within twenty minutes, he stood on a large rock at Xiaohei Stream.</p><p>A few days had passed, and the scale of the medicinal field had actually expanded slightly compared to before.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt so pleased. These herbs would be the first step in his journey to creating a glorious life.</p><p>After carefully reciting the types of herbs in his mind and estimating their quantity, Zhu Tianlei turned around with satisfaction, but he didn't leave; instead, he strolled over to the side of Xiaohei Stream.</p><p>The cluster of white insects in the stream had disappeared. Although the inspection report stated that the parasite's life cycle was only 3-5 days and it could not reproduce in a natural environment, Zhu Tianlei still scattered the previously prepared medicine into the stream.</p><p>Treating the symptoms but not the root; like grass revived by spring breeze!</p><p>The medicinal foam fell into the stream and quickly dissolved.</p><p>Only then did Zhu Tianlei hop onto a large rock to leave. He then practiced in the gourd cave for over an hour before feeling refreshed and descending the mountain.</p><p>In the clinic.</p><p>Ma Lanlan placed her fair little hands on her chin, lost in thought.</p><p>Not seeing Zhu Tianlei for several days felt like a piece of her heart was missing. Every day she was distracted; whenever someone passed by the door, she would run out to take a look.</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei told her he had gone into town to handle some affairs, her longing felt like an insect gnawing at her heart, vision, and soul without cease.</p><p>"Lanlan!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan was so engrossed in her reverie that she did not notice Zhu Tianlei entering from the door until he waved his hand in front of her. Only then did she snap out of it.</p><p>"Tianlei!"</p><p>As if pent-up grievances had been released, Ma Lanlan's eyes welled up with tears upon seeing Zhu Tianlei and she pitifully cried out.</p><p>"Stupid girl, why are you crying?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was bewildered; what could possibly be making this girl’s eyes red?</p><p>"Why did you go away for so many days?"</p><p>Before Zhu Tianlei could react, Ma Lanlan muttered resentfully.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei suddenly realized, so that girl is infatuated with me?</p><p>"Hehe, thinking of me? Are you thinking of the person I am or my...?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei deliberately elongated his tone; he enjoyed watching the girl go crazy.</p><p>"Eww, who would think of you? I'm all by myself in the clinic, it's so quiet and nice. It's better that you didn't come back!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei immediately put on an injured expression.</p><p>"Ah, heartbroken. I thought you'd think of me as much as I think of you, but turns out... Since that's the case, I'll go see patients now!"</p><p>After saying this, Zhu Tianlei turned around.</p><p>"Hold it, are you really leaving?"</p><p>"Yes, if I stayed here, I'd be annoying everyone!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei faced away from Ma Lanlan, his face wearing an unusually seductive smile, radiating a sense of mischief.</p><p>They say women's intelligence drops to zero when they're in love. Clearly aware that Zhu Tianlei was doing this on purpose, Ma Lanlan still felt a surge of anxiety, getting up from her chair and lunging forward to hug Zhu Tianlei's waist.</p><p>"Tianlei, I miss you, I really, really miss you!"</p><p>Feeling the softness and warmth behind him, along with that sweet voice that could melt one's heart, Zhu Tianlei's heart softened as well. He turned around and hugged Ma Lanlan back.</p><p>"Stupid girl, I miss you too, every day, every minute!"</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>Ma Lanlan lifted her misty eyes and asked seriously.</p><p>"Of course it's true, if you don't believe me, feel it yourself!"</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei lowered his head and instantly puckered Ma Lanlan's soft lips.</p><p>Longing poured over him like a sudden downpour.</p><p>The faint mint scent in Ma Lanlan's mouth aroused the desire within Zhu Tianlei's body.</p><p>He held Ma Lanlan's ample figure, kissing her while retreating all the way to behind the curtain on the side of the clinic.</p>

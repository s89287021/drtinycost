						<p>Máo Fang was quite urgent and got up without waiting for Wei Baoguo, heading straight for the floor where his lover's ward was located.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, on the other hand, wasn't in a rush. He only started moving after everyone had left the conference room one by one.</p><p>Li Ping was walking at the back.</p><p>"Tianlei, this patient is of exceptional importance; be careful!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Li Ping and knew that the latter's concern was genuine.</p><p>"Yes, thank you, I understand."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei and Li Ping had a somewhat friendly relationship after several interactions. The two walked side by side almost shoulder to shoulder.</p><p>Bai Song, who was walking ahead, turned his head slightly and glanced at them inadvertently. Although he quickly withdrew his gaze, Zhu Tianlei caught him in full view.</p><p>"Who is that person?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei asked.</p><p>"Which one?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pointed with his finger, but just then, Bai Song turned the corner of the corridor and disappeared from sight.</p><p>"Oh, he's named Bai Song. We're college classmates, not a bad person, but too much of a thinker..."</p><p>Li Ping didn't want to talk about Bai Song. Although they were college classmates and colleagues at the same hospital, their relationship wasn't close.</p><p>Mainly because as soon as Bai Song graduated, he found a better position, metaphorically "marrying" himself into it. Despite lacking genuine talent or expertise, he climbed to the position of department chief with his wife's family background.</p><p>This person was quite arrogant and didn't get along well with most colleagues, but today's open targeting of someone was unprecedented for him.</p><p>"Oh, I see."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't ask any further. He wasn't interested in Bai Song's condition; what intrigued him was the look Bai Song had given him just now.</p><p>It was far from friendly.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the sterile ward.</p><p>"Is it you?"</p><p>A little nurse in a pink nursing gown smiled and tugged on Zhu Tianlei's sleeve.</p><p>What a coincidence! It was indeed the same little nurse who had been on duty outside the ICU last time.</p><p>"Yes, I'm back."</p><p>Thinking about his previous encounter, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but chuckle to himself.</p><p>"It's wonderful. I thought I'd never see you again. The day we met, when I tried to talk to you, you just got into the elevator without even looking at me, and I..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at Wei Baoguo and the others standing beside him, raising a finger to his lips in a shushing gesture.</p><p>The little nurse stuck out her tongue; she was simply too excited!</p><p>"Only three people are allowed in the sterile ward at a time. Director Mao, me, and he will go inside, so please wait outside!"</p><p>Wei Baoguo cast Zhu Tianlei a cold glance. Zhu Tianlei shrugged indifferently; Wei Baoguo had treated him with hostility from the start, and though Zhu didn't know why, it didn't matter to him.</p><p>Putting on his sterile gown, Zhu Tianlei nodded at Li Ping, whose eyes were filled with worry, then followed Wei Baoguo into the ward.</p><p>The sterile ward was even more advanced and rigorous than the ICU, as if the air itself had been highly purified by instruments.</p><p>Just as they entered the room, Mao Fang pounced towards the patient's bed.</p><p>"Old Qiao!"</p><p>Indeed, it was a married couple. From their current situation alone, one could see that their feelings for each other were still quite good.</p><p>"Mao Director, please calm down."</p><p>Wei Baoguo stood behind Mao Fang and said softly.</p><p>"Hurry over here. As long as you can cure Old Qiao, I’ll agree to anything you want."</p><p>Mao Fang ignored Wei Baoguo and looked at Zhu Tianlei behind him, speaking firmly.</p><p>To be honest, this Mao Fang was very domineering; her words were quite unpleasant to hear.</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei understood the feeling of concern leading to chaos, he simply could not get close to this woman.</p><p>"I’ll do my best."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei swept past the two and walked to the bedside.</p><p>The man on the bed had a waxen complexion, sunken eyes, but there were dark spots around him that looked terrifying as if they had been injected with large amounts of mercury.</p><p>However, his cheeks were inexplicably swollen, almost obscuring his nose.</p><p>What he saw before his eyes was even more shocking than the photos he had seen on the projection.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei reached out to take the patient's pulse.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, this is a sterile ward. The patient’s condition is extremely weak; any external disturbance could worsen his illness. You’d better be careful."</p><p>"If the president is not reassured, then you can come yourself......"</p><p>"You......."</p><p>Wei Baoguo was at the brink of restraint. He was the president here; this was his domain, yet he had been repeatedly provoked by the other party.</p><p>"President Wei, don't get involved, let him handle it. If......"</p><p>Mao Fang only got halfway through her sentence, but Wei Baoguo understood perfectly. Yes, it wasn't a good job to take on. As someone who had practiced medicine for decades, he had never seen such a condition before. Zhu Tianlei was just an inexperienced rookie; even if his medical skills were high, he might not be able to cure the patient. If he failed, he would suffer the consequences!</p><p>Seeing that Wei Baoguo no longer spoke, Zhu Tianlei finally lowered his head again and placed his hand on the patient's wrist.</p><p>The pulse under his fingers seemed like a long snake writhing, but the way it moved was strange—it circled around, moving back and forth.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took a very long time to diagnose the pulse.</p><p>Mao Fang's face remained grave throughout, while Wei Baoguo had an almost imperceptible hint of mockery on his face.</p><p>Hmph, the higher one climbs, the harder they fall. Let Zhu Tianlei be arrogant and repeatedly trample him underfoot; this time, he would make sure to let him know who can be provoked and who cannot.</p><p>A few more minutes passed before Zhu Tianlei finally withdrew his hand and turned around.</p><p>His expression was not a good one.</p><p>Mao Fang's heart sank with a thud.</p><p>Wei Baoguo subconsciously relaxed his clenched fist.</p><p>"I can cure him!"</p><p>What?</p><p>Wei Baoguo's eyes widened in disbelief as he tried to verify what Zhu Tianlei had said.</p><p>"Director Wei didn't hear wrong, I can cure him. In one hour, I will wake him up."</p><p>A recluse who cherishes fine phrases, his words are breathtaking!</p><p>Unexpectedly, this line of poetry popped into Wei Baoguo's mind.</p><p>"Really? Doctor Zhu, then start right away!"</p><p>Máo Fāng's eyes, once lifeless, suddenly sparked with a flame that quickly spread like wildfire, nearly causing her to grab Zhu Tianlei's shoulder in excitement.</p><p>"All right!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei no longer spoke. To be honest, he was extremely confident, but it was also an attempt.</p><p>He reached into the inner pocket of his sterile gown and took out the 'Liu Zuan Wan' and silver needles he carried with him. This time, Wei Baoguo didn't say anything.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei placed the Liu Zuan Wan in the patient's mouth and then withdrew the silver needle.</p><p>The Lingyi's Seventeen Needles Technique.</p><p>Each needle penetrated 9.9mm into the subcutaneous tissue, precisely as such.</p><p>A flash of silver light appeared, the cold gleam resembling snow.</p>

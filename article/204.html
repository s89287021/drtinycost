						<p>"Ding ding ding!"</p><p>The person in the car saw that Yao Jianxiong did not react, assuming he had not heard. They pressed the horn several times in succession.</p><p>The mountain wind was howling; it was not just the shrill sound of the car horn that pierced the ears but even bird calls were crystal clear.</p><p>But Yao Jianxiong stood there like an old monk in meditation.</p><p>"Mayor Yang, this kid must have a hearing problem. I’ll get out to check on him. You stay put!"</p><p>The person in the car was none other than Yang Wenjie, who had rushed over upon receiving news.</p><p>He admired Zhu Tianlei immensely, bordering on admiration of his very essence.</p><p>He admired Zhu Tianlei's integrity, bearing, and a pure soul that stood out against the murky world.</p><p>He did not deny that this admiration was strongly tinged with individualism.</p><p>But so what?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was the pride of Yunhai City. When the whole country was gripped by fear from Dengluolin virus, it was Zhu Tianlei who stepped forward and turned the tide.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was the pride of Yunhai City and also Yang Wenjie’s pride.</p><p>So, upon hearing Deng Chang’s call, he could not sit still.</p><p>He knew that Zhu Tianlei would not cause a commotion at the county government for no reason, but regardless of the reason, it would become an indelible blemish on Zhu Tianlei's record.</p><p>He did not want this young man, who was like raw jade, to make any mistakes.</p><p>Even though there was a government meeting scheduled in two hours, he hastily gave his secretary a few instructions and urged the driver, Teng Kai, to head straight for Toad Gully.</p><p>"Forget it, Mayor Yang!"</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei and Deputy County Mayor Yang fell along with their car down the cliff below!"</p><p>Teng Kai had been a veteran driver for over a decade, having moved his entire family from another city to Yunhai City. He knew Yang Wenjie's thoughts intimately.</p><p>He was well aware of how much Yang Wenjie cared about Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Therefore, he understood what this news meant to Yang Wenjie.</p><p>"Mayor Yang...... Mayor Yang?"</p><p>Yang Wenjie felt his vision going dark.</p><p>Could what Teng Kai just said be true? How could it possibly be true?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was so young and talented, with extraordinary skills. No, no!</p><p>"Teng Kai, help me out!"</p><p>As Teng Kai supported Yang Wenjie, he noticed that Yang Wenjie's body was trembling.</p><p>He was utterly shocked.</p><p>Ultimately, he still underestimated Zhu Tianlei's status in Yang Wenjie's heart.</p><p>"Young man, did you see Zhu Tianlei's car go down?"</p><p>Yao Jianxiong had met Yang Wenjie before and knew that the person asking him questions was the mayor of Yunhai City.</p><p>But he showed no signs of tension; it seemed that Zhu Tianlei's departure had taken his emotions away with him.</p><p>"Yes, I saw it with my own eyes."</p><p>Yang Wenjie stood beside Yao Jianxiong.</p><p>An elderly man in his fifties, the mayor who held the fate of a city in his hands, and a young rural boy just barely into adulthood, stood together in perfect harmony.</p><p>Looking in the same direction, mourning the same person.</p><p>Soon after, Deng Chang's car arrived at the cliff's edge.</p><p>Knowing the moment Zhu Tianlei and Yang Zhongmin fell off the cliff, Deng Chang was also somewhat stunned and momentarily at a loss for words.</p><p>The phone rang soon afterward, reaching Mao Yu's mobile.</p><p>Mao Yu held the phone like a fool.</p><p>"Little Yu, what's wrong?"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao, who had gradually regained her composure, looked at Mao Yu in confusion.</p><p>But like the scene before her, Mao Yu stood there dumbfounded, as if her soul had been sucked out. This was something Zhang Yuntao had never seen before.</p><p>"Yun Tao, let's go to Suicide Cliff. There's also Lanlan and Xiaoxue."</p><p>Zhang Yun Tao was puzzled; why was Mao Yu's voice trembling?</p><p>And why were they going to Suicide Cliff?</p><p>"Little Yu....."</p><p>Zhang Yun Tao wanted to ask more questions, but Mao Yu had already opened the door and walked out.</p><p>No one saw that at the moment of leaving, Mao Yu's tears fell like a rainstorm.</p><p>She didn't believe it; she absolutely did not believe!</p><p>This belief stood as firm as Mount Tai in Mao Yu's heart, supporting her hand on the steering wheel so that she wouldn't lose control.</p><p>The three women sat in the car, looking at each other.</p><p>The atmosphere in the car was stiflingly terrible, and no one spoke.</p><p>A few minutes later, the car stopped by the side of Suicide Cliff.</p><p>What had once been a desolate and lifeless Suicide Cliff now stood several people.</p><p>"Consultant Mao, Chairman fell off the cliff..... he died!"</p><p>Seeing Mao Yu, Yao Jianxiong's emotions immediately collapsed; saying the word 'dead' almost drained all his strength.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>It was like a bolt of lightning out of nowhere.</p><p>Three women were stunned by the thunderclap, losing the ability to think.</p><p>"Lanlan, what is Yao Jianxiong saying?"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao looked at Ma Lanlan, hoping to hear something different from her mouth.</p><p>"I didn't hear what he said, didn't hear......"</p><p>Ma Lanlan shook her head.</p><p>She refused, refusing Yao Jianxiong's words to enter her ears.</p><p>His Tianlei, that man with his flirtatious smile and loose behavior who held her in the palm of his hand.</p><p>The man who made her feel like a god on earth during their lovemaking, the considerate man in her daily life, the man she loved more than enough, wanted to be close to more than enough and wished to spend her whole life with.</p><p>No, he wouldn't die!</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue didn't speak, but her eyes were fixed straight ahead. It seemed like there was still some warmth left on her body from Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Mr. Mao, the chairman really died......"</p><p>Yao Jianxiong seemed to have found an outlet for his emotions, sobbing and shouting these words at the same time.</p><p>"You're lying, Yao Jianxiong, you're spreading rumors, how could Tianlei be dead? Tell me, why are you lying......"</p><p>Suddenly, Zhang Yuntao lunged at Yao Jianxiong as if she had gone mad.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei went to Yunhai City because of her, for her sake.</p><p>"You are a curse to your husband and children; every man who is with you ends up with a bad fate......"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao heard her stepfather's words echo in her ear again.</p><p>It was she who had killed Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Why wasn't it her who died?</p><p>Suddenly, Zhang Yuntao released Yao Jianxiong and ran wildly towards the Cliff of Beheading.</p><p>"Tianlei, I'm coming with you!"</p><p>This sudden turn of events shocked everyone, but none of them possessed Zhu Tianlei's ability to turn the tide in a flash.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao's leap would inevitably result in her death.</p><p>"Yuntao....."</p><p>Mao Yu exclaimed, but Zhang Yuntao's graceful figure in her qipao vanished instantly.</p><p>Time froze at that moment.</p><p>This gruesome scene made Yang Wenjie shed a tear from the corner of his eye.</p><p>Suddenly......</p>

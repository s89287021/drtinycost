						<p>Assistant Li smirked as he pointed at the group of men in black clothes with his hand. He didn’t doubt that Zhu Tianlei would be afraid.</p><p>"I do know, but Assistant Li, are you sure you want to proceed with this?"</p><p>Assistant Li frowned, feeling extremely uncomfortable. Although Yao Gang had treated him poorly, Yao was still the village chief, and he could tolerate it. However, this impoverished boy actually looked down on him, truly believing that he, Li Xu, could be easily intimidated?</p><p>This time, Li Xu didn’t speak; he simply waved his hand, and those men in black clothes rushed toward Zhu Tianlei with a strong wind.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled faintly as he glanced at Li Xu, whose eyes were filled with anger. When Li Xu looked at him, Zhu Tianlei even extended his little finger to hook at Li Xu playfully.</p><p>Li Xu was so enraged that his face turned purple, but the thought of Zhu Tianlei kneeling and begging for mercy calmed the anger in his eyes slightly.</p><p>At this moment, the man in black who was leading the charge struck with a palm strike as fast as lightning toward Zhu Tianlei’s face.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>But just as he believed his palm would crush Zhu Tianlei’s skull, he found that his hand had missed its mark, and there was nothing before him but emptiness.</p><p>"Brother, I’m right here!"</p><p>As this tall man searched around in confusion, he heard Zhu Tianlei’s voice coming from behind. He turned abruptly, only to feel a dizziness wash over him as he tumbled forward and crashed to the ground with a thud.</p><p>His tailbone cracked loudly.</p><p>In the same instant that the tall man fell, Zhu Tianlei sidestepped and struck out with both hands, sending the two approaching men flying backward with immense force. They slammed into the rocks with a loud smack, emitting piercing screams of agony.</p><p>Seeing this, the other men in black clothes began to feel a bit afraid.</p><p>"What are you looking at? Get over here! If we don’t subdue this brat today, none of you will have it easy when you go back!"</p><p>Li Xu could not believe that Zhu Tianlei was so skilled, and his heart was filled with extreme frustration. However, he did not believe it; the ten or so security guards he had brought were the company's strongest protectors. Ten people should be able to handle Zhu Tianlei; even a rotating battle would exhaust him.</p><p>"Attack!"</p><p>The black-clad men, who had initially shown signs of retreating, once again perked up upon hearing Li Xu's command. This Li Xu was a favorite in front of the chairman, and their fate depended on just one word from him. Therefore, they could not afford to offend him.</p><p>This time, seven or eight people attacked simultaneously, but Zhu Tianlei's face remained unchanged as he moved with agility like a swallow, effortlessly weaving through the group of shadows.</p><p>A few seconds later.</p><p>Li Xu's expression turned extremely grim!</p><p>His supposedly proud security guards lay on the ground, rubbing their arms and legs, screaming in agony, none of them able to stand up.</p><p>"Assistant Li, I told you to think it through!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood on a nearby boulder. His plain shirt fluttered in the mountain breeze, his smile light as a chrysanthemum, both seductive and charming.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you'll regret this!"</p><p>Li Xu was not only furious but also terrified. Ten strong men were unable to land even one strike against Zhu Tianlei's defenses. If the other party wanted to deal with him, wouldn't it be as simple as lifting a hand?</p><p>He still had a promising future ahead of him and could not afford to end it like this. Therefore, without even calling out to the security guards who were on the ground, he immediately took off down the path, his speed increasing, as if fearing that Zhu Tianlei would chase after him.</p><p>"Hey, big brother, is your Shengshi Group really amazing?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had no intention of chasing Li Xu. He was more interested in seeing what other tricks Li Xu could pull out.</p><p>However, finding nothing better to do, he did not leave right away but instead crouched beside a black-clad man.</p><p>"I...... I don't know......"</p><p>The black-clad man who was asked about is named Zhang Qiang. When he was young, his family sent him to Shaolin Temple to study martial arts. He trained rigorously through the coldest winters and hottest summers for eight years at Shaolin Temple. After mastering his skills, he became a martial arts instructor in one of the town’s schools, known far and wide in Dahan Town for his prowess.</p><p>A year ago, due to family upheaval and urgent need for money, Zhang Qiang left the school to take up a security job with Shengshi Corporation. In this past year, he and other security guards had witnessed many skirmishes, even encountering armed desperadoes once.</p><p>However, Zhang Qiang had never been afraid or cowardly; being timid was the greatest insult to a martial artist.</p><p>Looking at the young Zhu Tianlei in front of him, Zhang Qiang felt his courage drained. When the man crouched beside him, he even sensed the scent of death.</p><p>"Big brother, I just want to ask and understand the situation!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said as he extended his hand. Zhang Qiang instinctively tried to dodge but could not match Zhu Tianlei’s speed. In an instant, Zhu Tianlei grabbed Zhang Qiang by the shoulder.</p><p>He resignedly closed his eyes; since taking up the security job, he had prepared to risk his life.</p><p>"Crack!"</p><p>Zhang Qiang opened his eyes in shock.</p><p>"Your arm clearly shows signs of old injuries. The bone was never properly healed after being injured, and although you might not feel it now, when you grow old, even picking things up will be a struggle!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said lightly.</p><p>Zhang Qiang was stunned; he moved his injured shoulder unconsciously and found that the area that used to sting with pain was no longer painful!</p><p>"Go back and eat some medicinal herbs for strengthening muscles and bones, and do some physical therapy. While it might not be fully healed, at least you won’t suffer in rainy or overcast weather!"</p><p>Zhang Qiang suddenly felt his eyes welling up. Only he knew how painful the discomfort in this injured arm was during rainy and overcast days, as if countless ants were boring into his heart.</p><p>"You... want to know what?"</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Zhang Qiang sat up from the ground and looked at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"What does Shengshi Group want to buy the land in Hamagou for?"</p><p>Zhang Qiang hesitated. He had heard something about this, but it was a private matter of the chairman. If he spoke up, he might lose his job.</p><p>"I won't make things difficult for you!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood up. He knew that these people were just working for others, and if they were truly capable, none of them would be doing this kind of work.</p><p>He wanted to know the truth but did not necessarily want to put these people in a difficult position.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Zhang Qiang struggled internally, then gritted his teeth and called out to Zhu Tianlei, who was about to leave.</p><p>"Qiangzi, think carefully! If the chairman finds out about this, you'll be finished!"</p><p>Seeing Zhang Qiang stop Zhu Tianlei, Wang Ming, who had fallen to one side, shouted excitedly.</p><p>Wang Ming and Zhang Qiang were fellow townspeople and had always been good friends. It was thanks to Wang Ming's recommendation that Zhang Qiang got a job at Shengshi Group.</p><p>Zhang Qiang knew that Wang Ming was only doing this out of concern for him, but he himself was a bold and loyal person who knew how to repay kindness. He knew that Zhu Tianlei could easily take action against them if he wanted to, and there were many ways to find out the truth.</p><p>But Zhu Tianlei didn't do any of these things. Just for this reason, Zhang Qiang admired him immensely. Losing his job was one thing, but he had made a friend in Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"I heard they want to build a cemetery."</p>

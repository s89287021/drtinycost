						<p>Zhu Tianlei followed the sound and saw Sun Jiang standing at the door with a wide grin, his arm bandage prominently visible. </p><p>This guy is really back to his old tricks after getting over his injury! </p><p>"Sun Jiang, weren't you put under house arrest by Old Uncle Sun?" </p><p>Hao Xinhui's usually cheerful face turned ice cold, yet shock was evident beneath the frosty exterior. </p><p>After she came back yesterday, she called Old Uncle Sun, who was extremely angry and repeatedly assured her that he would teach Sun Jiang a lesson. That night, Sun Family's butler specially visited to apologize on behalf of Old Uncle Sun, stating that Sun Jiang had been punished with house arrest. </p><p>But right now... </p><p>"Haha, Hao Xinhui, you really are naive. No matter how foolish I am, I'm still his son, and no matter how forgetful he is, he can't turn a blind eye to me, an outsider like you!" </p><p>Sun Jiang's few words caused Hao Xinhui's expression to drastically change. She never expected Old Uncle Sun to merely appease him; just one night later, Sun Jiang was openly here again. </p><p>"Sun Jiang, are you thinking about taking your other arm to the hospital for a stroll too?" </p><p>Zhu Tianlei grabbed a handful of peanuts from the table and popped them into his mouth. At 170 yuan per dish, these peanuts couldn't be wasted! </p><p>"Hmph, brat, do you think this place is still Hama Gou? This is Yuhai City, my Sun Jiang's territory. Kid, if there's a way to heaven, you don't take it; if there's no gate to hell, you break in. Haha, brothers, get me!" </p><p>At Sun Jiang's call, a crowd of people suddenly gathered at the door, each holding weapons. </p><p>"Sun Jiang, what are you planning to do?" </p><p>Hao Xinhui, being a woman, paled at the sight and seemed clearly prepared for this confrontation. </p><p>What should she do? As Sun Jiang said, this was Yuhai City, his territory, and no matter how formidable Zhu Tianlei was, a dragon could not suppress a local thug. </p><p>"Oh oh oh, Big Beauty Hao, are you feeling heartbroken? Hmph, if you had obediently lain with me back then, none of this would have happened. I tell you, if this kid dies here today, Big Beauty Hao will share the credit. Get me!"</p><p>Sun Jiang's eyes widened, and the people surrounding him quickly gathered close. The waiter who had yet to leave the cabin was so frightened that he trembled like a sieve, his face drained of color.</p><p>"Sun Jiang, I think your only talent is bullying women. You want revenge, don't you? Fine, let's find a spacious place; we won't do it in this restaurant. What do you say?"</p><p>In a moment, Zhu Tianlei finished eating the remaining peanuts in the dish, wiped his mouth smeared with icing sugar, and said lazily.</p><p>"Hmph, stinky brat, this restaurant belongs to the Sun family's business. Today, if I don't beat you senseless, I won't be named Sun anymore!"</p><p>Sun Jiang cast a sinister glance at the bandage on his wrist, and the anger in his eyes seemed ready to tear Zhu Tianlei apart.</p><p>"Xiao Mei, take this little girl and go outside first!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei knew that today's confrontation was inevitable, so his expression became slightly more serious. However, it was only a slight seriousness; compared to the tension before a major battle for ordinary people, his demeanor was more akin to meeting someone for tea.</p><p>"Tianlei, you......"</p><p>"Don't worry, I don't take these lackeys seriously."</p><p>Hao Xinmei looked worriedly at the ten or twenty people gathered outside, feeling anxious but also realizing that staying behind would only distract Zhu Tianlei and be of no use. Going out might be better; at least she could call the police.</p><p>Seeing Hao Xinmei's anxiety in her eyes and hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, Sun Jiang's rationality vanished completely.</p><p>"Hmph, none of you are leaving. What are you all standing there for? Attack!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's expression finally darkened.</p><p>He hadn't expected Sun Jiang to dare attack Hao Xinmei as well. Since childhood, he had despised men who bullied women the most. Yet, this Sun Jiang enjoyed bullying women, especially the woman Zhu Tianlei fancied.</p><p>"Xiao Mei, stand inside. Since this bastard is asking for death, I won't be blamed by Zhu Tianlei for being ruthless!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei looked at Zhu Tianlei's tall figure and, for some reason, her originally chaotic heart calmed down miraculously. She grabbed the little waiter and walked straight to the corner.</p><p>"Up!"</p><p>Sun Jiang gave a single command, and the mêlée began.</p><p>"Hush!"</p><p>"You......you you......"</p><p>Sun Jiang stared at Zhu Tianlei in disbelief. At this moment, he regretted his impulsiveness; no matter how strong his neck was, it couldn't possibly match the hardness of a steel pipe.</p><p>"How about it, Sun Jiang? Do you remember what I said yesterday?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's lips curled into a slight smile as he mocked Sun Jiang and the thugs behind him who were wielding steel pipes.</p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p>"If you dare to touch Hao Xinmei again, I'll break your legs!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face suddenly darkened. Sun Jiang shuddered and instinctively took two steps back; he knew that Zhu Tianlei was not joking.</p><p>However, this was Yunhai City, his territory. He had so many men following him who depended on him for food. If he backed down now, how could he show his face in Yunhai City in the future?</p><p>In an instant, countless thoughts raced through Sun Jiang's mind, but ultimately, pride prevailed.</p><p>"Hmph, stinky brat, you still don't know that death is knocking at your door. Brothers, here's a gold card from Yunhai Commercial Bank; there's 200,000 yuan in it. Whoever can get rid of this brat for me will have the 200,000 yuan!"</p><p>Twenty thousand yuan!</p><p>Since ancient times, money has moved people's hearts. Money can make one prosperous and successful, but it can also breed evil. The group of men who had already developed fear and were about to back down changed their looks when they heard Sun Jiang's words.</p><p>"Brothers, attack!"</p><p>No one knew who shouted first, but the bouncers who had stepped back rushed forward again. This time, each of their faces was filled with madness.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei reached out to take a napkin from the table and gently wiped the sauce off his mouth before casually tossing it away, like a white paper butterfly dancing gracefully in the air.</p><p>With a light step, Zhu Tianlei did not wait for those people to approach him but instead led the charge into the crowd. His body spun as he swung his arms wildly; within a few movements, everyone suddenly felt their shoulders tingling, and then came a series of clanging sounds.</p><p>When they looked at Zhu Tianlei again, he had somehow moved to stand beside Sun Jiang at the back of the crowd, smiling as he watched them.</p>

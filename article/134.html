						<p>Wan Tao, considering the face of your father, I won’t hold you accountable. No matter who this person is, we will definitely do our utmost to rescue him, but his lungs and spleen are damaged too severely; we can’t guarantee if he can survive.”</p><p>Song Binen’s temper was very well-controlled. Facing Wan Tao’s unreasonable behavior, Song Binen did not lose his composure.</p><p>“Stop talking nonsense. In short, as long as John is alive, you, Song Binen, will remain the director of County Hospital. If John dies, you better pack your bags and go home!”</p><p>Several foreigners stood aside with anxious expressions. Seeing Wan Tao flailing his arms around but not taking any action to save John, one of them finally couldn’t bear it anymore and sidled up to Song Binen, grabbing his wrist.</p><p>“You... must... save the person... you... must save him...”</p><p>The foreigner’s Mandarin wasn’t very good, but the main meaning was clear. However, Song Binen, who was already over fifty, couldn’t withstand the force; he almost stumbled and fell onto the injured man.</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei was very angry with Wan Tao, he couldn’t bear to see Song Binen being tormented like this. Moreover, the other party wasn’t from his own country; if the person really died in County Hospital, it might not be good for his country’s reputation.</p><p>Personal grievances had to give way to national and ethnic righteousness.</p><p>“Director Song, let me handle it!”</p><p>Zhu Tianlei ignored Wan Tao and walked over to help Song Binen up, then reached out to lift the clothes covering the foreigner.</p><p>“What are you? Get lost!”</p><p>Wan Tao was berated by Song Binen and glared at by the foreigner. Unable to vent his anger, he saw Zhu Tianlei approaching and immediately lashed out in fury.</p><p>“Wan Tao, shut your mouth!”</p><p>Song Binen was extremely angry. Zhu Tianlei had put a lot of effort into recruiting him to the hospital, and if Wan Tao drove him away, where would he go to find another one?</p><p>“This is County Hospital’s guest professor. If you offend him, get ready to deal with his body!”</p><p>Although Song Binen had excellent self-control, he wasn’t without anger. And a person like Song Binen, who usually appeared gentle and courteous, was terrifying when angry.</p><p>Wan Tao, considering your father’s face, I won’t hold you accountable. No matter who this person is, we will do our utmost to rescue him; however, his lungs and spleen are severely damaged, so we cannot guarantee his survival.”</p><p>Song Binen had excellent self-control. Despite Wan Tao’s unreasonable behavior, Song Binen remained calm.</p><p>“Stop talking nonsense. Simply put, if John lives, you, Song Binen, will remain the director of County Hospital. If John dies, pack your bags and go home!”</p><p>Several foreigners stood to one side with anxious expressions. Seeing Wan Tao flail his arms around but fail to take any action towards John’s rescue, one foreigner finally could not tolerate it anymore and approached Song Binen, grabbing his wrist.</p><p>“You must save the person...”</p><p>The foreigner’s Mandarin was not very good, but the main meaning was clear. However, Song Binen, who was over fifty, could barely withstand the force; he nearly stumbled and fell onto the injured man.</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei was extremely angry with Wan Tao, he could not bear to see Song Binen being tormented further. Moreover, the other party was not from his own country; if the person really died in County Hospital, it would be bad for his country’s reputation.</p><p>Personal grievances must yield to national and ethnic righteousness.</p><p>“Director Song, let me handle it!”</p><p>Zhu Tianlei ignored Wan Tao and walked over to help Song Binen up, then lifted the clothes covering the foreigner.</p><p>“What are you? Get lost!”</p><p>Wan Tao was berated by Song Binen and glared at by the foreigner. Unable to vent his anger, he saw Zhu Tianlei approaching and immediately lashed out in fury.</p><p>“Wan Tao, shut your mouth!”</p><p>Song Binen was extremely angry. He had gone through great lengths to recruit Zhu Tianlei to the hospital, and if Wan Tao drove him away, where would he find another expert?</p><p>“This is County Hospital’s guest professor. If you offend him, get ready to deal with his body!”</p><p>Although Song Binen had excellent self-control, he was not without anger. And a person like Song Binen, who usually appeared gentle and courteous, was terrifying when enraged.</p><p>Considering your father's face, Wan Tao, I will not hold you accountable. Regardless of who this person is, we will do everything in our power to save him; however, his lungs and spleen are severely damaged, so we cannot guarantee his survival.”</p><p>Song Binen had exceptional self-control. Despite Wan Tao’s unreasonable behavior, Song Binen remained calm.</p><p>“Stop the nonsense. Simply put, if John lives, you, Song Binen, will remain the director of County Hospital. If John dies, pack your bags and go home!”</p><p>Several foreigners stood to one side with anxious expressions.

If you offend him, get ready to deal with his body!”</p><p>Although Song Binen had excellent self-control, he was not without anger. And a person like Song Binen, who usually appeared gentle and courteous, was terrifying when enraged.</p><p>Wan Tao was startled.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, however, did not take it seriously. Not only Wan Tao but even his powerful uncle, whom Zhu Tianlei served as an official, would not scare him. His actions were for Song Bainen and the county hospital.</p><p>Several foreigners looked at Zhu Tianlei with full caution. In their view, the truly skilled doctors in this country should be those old men with white beards and hair reaching sixty years of age, rather than Zhu Tianlei, who appeared to be a young and inexperienced doctor.</p><p>Thus, Wan Tao was terrified by Song Bainen, while several foreigners surrounded Zhu Tianlei aggressively.</p><p>"Get...... out of the way....... do not touch....... don't touch John......"</p><p>It was still that black man with a scar on his face.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not hear him. With just one glance, he had already realized that this foreigner named John, with golden hair and blue eyes, seemed to have been bitten by some animal in his abdomen, revealing white intestines and lungs, with weak pulse barely detectable, making his condition even more critical and complicated compared to Li Xu and Ge Tianying.</p><p>"Director Song, I will take care of saving his life. You focus on stitching up his wound."</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Song Bainen was already renowned as an authoritative figure in surgery, so stitching up the wound was a piece of cake for him.</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei took out silver needles from his clothes.</p><p>"You...... get out of the way......"</p><p>A foreigner reached out and grabbed Zhu Tianlei's shoulder. John was their benefactor, and if he died, they would not receive any compensation. Therefore, they could not allow this person who clearly did not look like a doctor to treat John.</p><p>Yang Hua stood aside. He had no martial arts skills and his English was poor, so all he could do was watch anxiously, almost rubbing his hands raw with worry.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had already drawn out the silver needles and was in no mood to fight those foreigners. As their palm came close to him, he ducked down and avoided it, simultaneously piercing two silver needles into the foreigner's body.</p><p>The other black men saw their companion's attack fail and immediately joined in, but Zhu Tianlei seemed like a mudskipper in quicksand; despite the flurry of punches and kicks from several people, they could not even touch the edge of his clothes. In an instant, seventeen silver needles were firmly embedded into the foreigners' bodies.</p><p>"Mr. Song, it's your turn!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei finished speaking and darted away, his body moving swiftly. Several Black men had already been provoked by Zhu Tianlei into a state of fury, so even as Zhu Tianlei clearly indicated that he was giving way, they did not intend to back down and continued to pursue him.</p><p>Relying on the corner of the wall, Zhu Tianlei stood firm, his hands behind his back, wearing a smile.</p><p>A flash of brilliance appeared in the eyes of several Black men. It seemed they had backed themselves into a corner by their own actions, truly courting death.</p><p>As several dark figures leaped towards him, Zhu Tianlei touched down lightly on the ground and then made a small leap, flying out along the wall. His palms moved like the wind, producing several crisp sounds, causing the several black-clad men to grimace in pain and hop around on the spot.</p><p>"What did you do to them?"</p><p>Wan Tao had been standing by, watching Zhu Tianlei's extraordinary skill with a mix of dread and relief at having stayed far away. Otherwise, he would have ended up like this.</p><p>But since they were John's men, he had no choice but to toughen up and understand what was happening.</p><p>"Do you want to know?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei suddenly smiled at Wan Tao, who shuddered and did not dare ask another question.</p><p>The Black men could not figure out what method the other party had used on them; they felt completely numb and unable to move. They were all professional bodyguards, quite renowned in Europe's bodyguard circles, but why was this seemingly weak and thin young man so formidable?</p><p>They couldn't understand.</p><p>On the hospital bed, Song Boyan worked swiftly with Yang Hua's assistance, nearing the end of the suturing process. Zhu Tianlei approached, placing his hand on John's wrist to allow spirit energy to flow in slowly.</p><p>After refining and integrating his inner spirit energy over this period, it had advanced to a new stage. As seen at that moment, within just three or four minutes, John's complexion turned rosy.</p><p>When Song Boyan finished the suturing work and was still in the process of retracting his hand, John slowly opened his eyes.</p><p>"I... I can't believe it!"</p><p>Wan Tao looked at John, his mouth agape in shock, unable to close it. </p><p>How could this be possible? He had lashed out at Song Bainen so fiercely precisely because he felt guilty. If not for his urging John to conduct an expedition into the mountains, they would never have encountered a bear. Consequently, John wouldn't have been injured and on the brink of death.</p><p>But now, John was miraculously awake after only half an hour.</p><p>"Was it you who saved me?"</p><p>John's Chinese was quite good; as soon as he opened his eyes, he looked at Song Bainen and asked.</p><p>"No, it wasn't me. It was Dr. Zhu Tianlei, our hospital's emergency physician."</p>

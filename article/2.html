						<p>What? Li Fugui's head throbbed. How could such an incident happen in Toad Ditch? Although Zhu Tianlei was usually idle, poking cats and teasing dogs, somewhat irresponsible, he couldn't possibly do something like this!</p><p>"Hai Shan, go to the village quickly and call everyone to gather at the entrance."</p><p>Li Fugui immediately made up his mind. This was a monumental matter; he couldn't handle it alone or end up in even more trouble.</p><p>Zhang Hai Shan was stunned as well, but upon hearing Li Fugui's order, he dashed back to the village.</p><p>"Yun Tao, let's also go to the entrance of the village. Please tell me again what exactly happened?"</p><p>Chen Widow lowered her head, a flash of guilt in her eyes that quickly disappeared as she raised it again, displaying an extremely frightened and pitiful appearance that moved Li Fugui once more.</p><p>"I heard there was a large toad lair in the gourd cave and thought about going there for some luck. Who knew that just as I arrived at the gourd cave, I heard people arguing inside. I recognized it as Hu Dainiu and Zhu Tianlei's voices, and they seemed to be quarreling over who found the toad lair first. I wanted to go in and mediate, but when I entered, I saw Zhu Tianlei... he pushed Hu Dainiu off the lookout cliff of the gourd cave."</p><p>Chen Widow had tears on her cheeks as she described the scene vividly.</p><p>She didn't believe anyone would doubt her story; after all, arguments and fights over toads were not uncommon in Toad Ditch Village.</p><p>As Chen Widow cried and spoke, Li Fugui maintained a stern expression. By the time they reached the entrance of the village, it was already crowded with people, almost everyone in the village had gathered there.</p><p>"Yun Tao, tell us again!"</p><p>Chen Widow stood among the crowd, repeating the story in front of Village Head Yao Gang. This time, her narration was even more vivid and fluent.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure collapsed to the ground in the crowd.</p><p>"Tianlei's mom?"</p><p>The one who fell to the ground was none other than Zhu Tianlei's mother, Hou Suqin.</p><p>Hou Suqin didn’t have Zhu Tianlei until she was thirty years old, and she really treated him like a precious treasure, holding him in her hands as if he would fall and keeping him in her mouth as if he would melt. Hearing such news now made her heart panic, and she fainted on the spot.</p><p>This was the first time something like this had happened at Hamagou Village Head. Yao Gang listened to the villagers buzzing like flies, feeling his head about to explode.</p><p>"Madam Chen, you are sure that Zhu Tianlei is the one who killed someone?"</p><p>Yao Gang looked at Madam Chen and asked again.</p><p>"Village Chief, I saw it clearly with my own eyes. If I hadn't run fast enough, Zhu Tianlei might have killed me to cover up his tracks!"</p><p>Madam Chen became more fluent with each word, even saying things like killing for silence.</p><p>"Let's go to the gourd cave. If Madam Chen is telling the truth, then let Zhu Tianlei pay with his life!"</p><p>Human lives were at stake; as the village chief, Yao Gang could not show mercy.</p><p>The villagers were also emotionally charged, their shovels lifting up dust from the ground, making it seem like a sandstorm in broad daylight.</p><p>Just as the villagers were about to head toward the gourd cave in full force, someone slowly walked down the small road at the village entrance.</p><p>As the figure approached, the crowd fell silent suddenly.</p><p>Madam Chen spotted the figure on the small road through the crowd and screamed immediately.</p><p>"Ghost!"</p><p>Her eyes rolled back, and she fainted.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stopped about seven or eight meters away from the villagers, his face showing a look of shock.</p><p>His gaze then swept over Madam Chen coldly.</p><p>Hmph, little girls, do you know fear now?</p><p>"Village chief, what’s going on here?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hid his emotions well and looked at Yao Gang while asking.</p><p>"You... You killed someone?"</p><p>Yao Gang was indeed a man, the village chief, with better mental fortitude than other villagers.</p><p>"Village chief, what do you say? What’s happening here? What happened in the village?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was somewhat bewildered. It was clear that Old Widow Chen intended to harm him, though he didn’t know why. But how could she have killed someone?</p><p>"Tell me, did you go to the Gourd Cave?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei instinctively glanced at the fallen Old Widow Chen. Yao Gang saw this glance and interpreted it differently; it seemed that what Old Widow Chen had said was true.</p><p>"I went to the Gourd Cave, I heard there were toad nests..."</p><p>Before figuring out the truth, Zhu Tianlei didn’t intend to lie. It was evident that something was wrong.</p><p>"You dog, give me back my son’s life!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hadn’t finished speaking when Old Lady Hu, Hu Dainiu’s mother, lunged at him. The sixty-something woman ran as fast as a young man and slapped Zhu Tianlei across the face.</p><p>"Old Lady Hu, what are you doing....."</p><p>Seeing her son being beaten, Zhu Tazi couldn’t bear it any longer and, with one half-leg dragging, interposed himself between Zhu Tianlei and Old Lady Hu.</p><p>"Zhu Tazi, it’s all your fault, this old scoundrel, for giving birth to this monster. Today, I’ll risk my life to avenge my son!"</p><p>Watching Old Lady Hu's hand about to land on Zhu Quezi, a flash of anger surged in Zhu Tianlei's eyes as he reached out and grabbed her wrist. </p><p>"Old Lady Hu, what are you doing? What have I done for you to keep pestering me like this?"</p><p>"What am I doing? Oh my heavens, why is my life so miserable? A good son just disappeared, and now the murderer is attacking me too. Come on, come on, kill me as well so I can join my poor son in heaven... Old Heaven..."</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, tell me, did you push Hu Dagniu off Windy Cliff?"</p><p>Apo Jang's patience wore thin with Old Lady Hu's antics, and he turned to Zhu Tianlei with a sharp tone.</p><p>Caught off guard by Apo Jang's question, Zhu Tianlei was stunned. Hu Dagniu? Pushed down?</p><p>Suddenly, a light bulb went off in his head. Zhu Tianlei finally understood what was going on. No wonder that Widow Chen had lured him up the mountain and for no reason shattered his skull with a big stone—she must have been trying to frame him! </p><p>Zhu Tianlei was livid, wishing he could strip Widow Chen naked and beat her fifty times.</p><p>But this thought only flashed through his mind briefly. Almost immediately, Zhu Tianlei had a plan.</p><p>"Village Chief, you say I pushed Hu Dagniu off Windy Cliff. What evidence do you have?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei straightened up and asked calmly.</p><p>"Evidence... oh right, Widow Chen saw it with her own eyes. How could it be false?"</p><p>Apo Jang pointed to the still unconscious Widow Chen on the ground.</p><p>"Oh..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei drew out his words, adopting an air of realization.</p>

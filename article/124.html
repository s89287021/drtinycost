						<p>Several comrades who were arranged by the departments stood on one side, silently watching, knowing that they had nothing to do at the moment. </p><p>"Alright, now you start proving what you said!" </p><p>Huang Hai took a deep breath and spoke up.</p><p>"Sis, I am going to help remove the poison from your body. You might feel very uncomfortable in your stomach, but please endure it."</p><p>The little girl, who had been lying on the ground without uttering a word, surprisingly responded with a 'yeah.'</p><p>Xue Ping had already placed saline solution and gauze beside the little girl as per Zhu Tianlei's instructions.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took out a silver needle and quickly stabbed it into both sides of the girl’s heart and stomach. The girl groaned softly and her pale face suddenly turned bright red, followed by a loud vomit that spat out a puddle of gray-brown, pungently sour vomitus.</p><p>The onlookers immediately let out disgusted cries, taking two steps back.</p><p>"Daughter, my dear daughter!"</p><p>A woman who had been sitting motionlessly beside them suddenly regained her senses, screamed and was about to rush over, but stopped in her tracks when she saw the puddle of vomitus beside the girl.</p><p>"Doctor Xue, hang a bottle of saline solution for her and use gauze to clean her mouth."</p><p>Xue Ping did not hesitate at all and immediately acted according to Zhu Tianlei's instructions.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zhu Tianlei picked up a small stick from the ground, stirred the vomitus around, and then raised his head to look at Huang Hai and the others again.</p><p>"This vomitus has an acidic stench, is gray-brown in color, and contains some white pus-like substances. This is the typical symptom of poisoning by 'Bixuhcao.' These white pus-like substances are a result of Bixuhcao eroding the inner walls of her stomach and intestines, causing the gastric mucosa to peel off and ulcerate."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke slowly.</p><p>"Even if it's Bixuhcao poisoning, this does not explain the three issues you mentioned earlier."</p><p>Huang Hai hit the nail on the head.</p><p>The crowd gathered around also joined in chorus.</p><p>"The appearance of Pei Hu grass is almost identical to a certain traditional Chinese medicine. In mountainous areas, there are often cases where villagers mistakenly consume it and suffer from poisoning. This similar herb is Motherwort."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was not in a rush; he had plenty of time.</p><p>"Isn't Motherwort used for treating gynecological diseases?"</p><p>Someone in the crowd said.</p><p>"Yes, little sister, would you mind passing me the medicine box in your pocket?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the girl, who had been supported to sit up by Xue Ping. He lowered his voice and continued, even though he noticed her hesitant look and brief glance to the side. The girl's hand was clutching a plastic bag; it just hadn't been visible when she was lying on the ground.</p><p>The girl hesitated for a while before finally releasing her small hand and passing the plastic bag to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took out the medicine box from the plastic bag—it was the box of Beauty Pill. He could recognize it even with his eyes closed.</p><p>"This is fake medicine. First, the serial number on the box is incorrect. Every batch of Beauty Pills produced by Tianlei Pharmaceutical has a unique serial number; the first letter is T, the second letter is L, and the subsequent letters are any one of H, M, or G. It absolutely cannot be Q. That's point one."</p><p>Huang Hai widened his eyes in surprise before thoughtfully looking at Zhu Tianlei again.</p><p>"Secondly, the inner packaging of Beauty Pills uses original imported tin foil material. For this batch of Beauty Pills, the verification code on the tin foil is printed at the very bottom of the inner packaging, not in the middle. I believe the Food and Drug Administration should have records of this; every batch of products from Tianlei Pharmaceutical is reported to them and electronically documented."</p><p>After finishing his explanation, Zhu Tianlei flipped the medicine box over a few times before taking out one of the remaining pills and sniffing it under his nose.</p><p>"The Beauty Pill produced by Tianlei Pharmaceutical uses a total of seventeen herbs. Each herb is configured in a specific ratio, processed entirely by hand, which makes the flatness and glossiness of the pills absolutely unmatched by the ones in my hands. Furthermore, this pill contains only thirteen Chinese medicines, missing precisely the three that are crucial to the core efficacy of Beauty Pill."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood up, his gaze resolute and his expression stern. At this moment, the sharpness in him was unbearable to look at.</p><p>"So this is counterfeit medicine, and the poison in this little girl does not come from these thirteen herbs; it must have been administered later, and in a quantity sufficient to cause death."</p><p>The little girl, who had originally been sitting on the ground, suddenly widened her eyes, staring unbelief at her mother standing nearby, her lips trembling.</p><p>The woman glanced at the little girl and slowly moved her feet backward.</p><p>"Do you want to run?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shifted his stance and almost immediately found himself behind the woman, blocking her escape route.</p><p>The two police officers had already sensed something amiss and approached the woman without waiting for Zhu Tianlei's instructions, their eyes fixed on her with suspicion.</p><p>"Little sister, what exactly happened? I think you should be the most aware of it."</p><p>The little girl stared wide-eyed, tears welling up in her eyes but never falling. She moved her lips but eventually lowered her head and said nothing.</p><p>"Officer, this little sister has probably been greatly frightened. With things having come to this pass, I believe you all must understand what's happening without me saying any more. I will no longer be involved in this matter. As for the framing I mentioned..."</p><p>At that moment, Huang Hai was completely shocked. Just now, two staff members from the drug administration had found the electronic records of the Beauty Dan batch Zhu Tianlei had mentioned through remote work, confirming that this box of Beauty Dan was indeed counterfeit.</p><p>"This pharmacy originally refused to sell Tianlei Pharmaceutical's Beauty Dan, but is now openly selling counterfeit medicine, which clearly indicates they are breaking the law for profit and completely disregarding human life. They have no morals whatsoever. However, when the incident occurred, they placed all the blame on Tianlei Pharmaceutical. Isn't that framing and malicious accusation?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei suddenly turned around, his cold gaze falling on the words 'Dahua Chain Pharmacy' behind him.</p><p>"Wow, who is this guy? He's amazing!"</p><p>"Yeah, he's like Sherlock Holmes! His reasoning is flawless!"</p><p>......</p><p>Huang Hai glanced at Zhu Tianlei and finally couldn't hold back.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled faintly.</p><p>"Tianlei Pharmaceutical Corporation Chairman, Zhu Tianlei."</p><p>Huang Hai's eyes widened again. The chairman of Tianlei Pharmaceutical Corporation, a newly appointed city representative for outstanding youth—He hadn't expected that this outstanding youth was not only excellent but also so capable.</p><p>That day, Zhu Tianlei once again made headlines on the top trending segment of Yunhai City's most popular TV program with a live broadcast throughout.</p><p>In one night, Zhu Tianlei became a celebrity in Yunhai City.</p><p>In one night, Zhu Tianlei became the dream lover of thousands of young girls in Yunhai City.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a room at Zuiwei Manor in Dahexian County, a middle-aged man raised his fist and knocked over the teacup and teapot on the coffee table with a single punch.</p><p>On the TV screen before the middle-aged man was playing Yunhai Civic News.</p>

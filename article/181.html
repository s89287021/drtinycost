						<p>"I have already hired a lawyer, and we can start the lawsuit proceedings immediately."</p><p>Hao Xin said with a furrowed brow.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at all the people in the courtyard and then glanced at his parents standing beside him, their eyes also filled with tears. He sighed.</p><p>"Well, let me first talk to President Tang; there might be some misunderstanding."</p><p>"Then call now!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was somewhat helpless but knew he had to make a call to calm these people down.</p><p>"Vice President Tang, I just read the news and wanted to ask what is going on."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke politely.</p><p>"Sorry, I can't take calls right now. I'll give you a call later..."</p><p>A series of clicks could be heard.</p><p>Tang Wen hung up, and from the noise in the phone, it seemed he was still at the interview site.</p><p>"Hmph, he's doomed!"</p><p>Mao Yu and Hao Xin exchanged glances and then walked out of the courtyard briskly, as if they had agreed beforehand.</p><p>Zhang Yun Tao stood among the crowd. Although she did not have the abilities of Mao Yu or Hao Xin, she fully supported their actions; those who bullied her beloved man should pay a price.</p><p>"Tianlei, you are honest and generous, which is good, but when it comes to defending your rights, you must be firm."</p><p>Song Baina looked at Zhu Tianlei and said with deep feeling,</p><p>For Song Baina, Zhu Tianlei had genuine respect in his heart. Song Baina truly cherished his talent and provided sincere help without holding back. To be precise, Song Baina could be considered Zhu Tianlei's patron or mentor.</p><p>At the city hospital, Tang Wen had just finished an interview and returned to his office.</p><p>In recent days, he had been enjoying great glory.</p><p>One interview followed another, with flowers and applause flooding towards him like a wave. He made it to the front page of mainstream media and was even invited by an international weekly in America.</p><p>He had once thought that Wei Baoguo would keep him down for life, but now his life had changed. Even if he had to pay a price, he did not regret it.</p><p>"You are......"</p><p>Just as Tang Wen was basking in the joy of seeing his interview report on TV, the door to his office was abruptly pushed open.</p><p>Two pretty young women walked in.</p><p>"Are you Vice President Tang?"</p><p>Hearing the beauty's question, a trace of satisfaction flickered across Tang Wen's heart.</p><p>Who wouldn't want to be admired by a beautiful woman, even someone past fifty like Tang Wen?</p><p>"Yes, I am Tang Wen. What can I do for the two beauties?"</p><p>Tang Wen tried his best to appear gentle and scholarly in his smile. His choice had been correct; as long as he became famous, wealth, fame, power, and beauty would all come flocking.</p><p>"What can you do? You thief, a petty thief stealing others' hard work! How dare you accept an interview, truly a disgrace to civilization!"</p><p>Mao Yu rushed forward, placing both hands on the desk in front of Tang Wen and pointed at him as he scolded.</p><p>"This..... I don't understand what you're saying, does this beauty have any misunderstanding about me?"</p><p>Tang Wen's face turned pale; this scene was not what he had imagined!</p><p>"Misunderstanding my ass! I'll tell you, Tang Wen, the lawyer has drafted an infringement document, and you're just waiting to go to jail!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei also rushed forward with equally fierce eyes.</p><p>"Ladies, I believe there must be some misunderstanding here. I, Tang Wen, have always been law-abiding; I've never done anything out of line. I don't understand at all what you're talking about."</p><p>Jiang was indeed an old hand; if Tang Wen didn't know what was happening earlier, now he immediately understood who these two people were after.</p><p>But so what?</p><p>Now everyone knew that the medicine was his research, and the patent application had already been submitted. Once the application was approved, what Zhu Tianlei did would be useless.</p><p>"Don't understand? Then we'll see you in court!"</p><p>With that said, without waiting for Tang Wen to speak, Mao Yu and Hao Xinmei turned around and left, heading straight for the law firm.</p><p>These two people came here entirely because they couldn't swallow their pride. Now that they had vented, it was naturally time to get down to business.</p><p>If you bully Zhu Tianlei, don't think you'll have a good life!</p><p>Watching the two people leave with the faint fragrance of perfume lingering in the air, Tang Wen's face darkened.</p><p>Victory belonged to him; no one could take it away!</p><p>Hao Xinmei acted quickly, and with a hefty sum spent on smoothing relations, infringement was accepted within just two days. The lawyer representing Zhu Tianlei in court was Yunhaicheng's famous 'Iron Teeth Copper Teeth' Lei Pan.</p><p>"This..... I don't understand what you're saying, does this beauty have any misunderstanding about me?"</p><p>Tang Wen's face turned pale; this scene did not match his expectations!</p><p>"No misunderstanding at all! Tang Wen, the lawyer has drafted an infringement document, and you are headed to jail!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei rushed forward as well, with equally intense eyes.</p><p>"Ladies, I believe there must be some misunderstanding here. I, Tang Wen, have always been law-abiding; I've never done anything out of line. I don't understand at all what you're talking about."</p><p>Jiang was indeed experienced; if Tang Wen didn't know what was happening earlier, he immediately understood who these two people were targeting.</p><p>But so what?</p><p>Now everyone knew that the medicine was his research, and the patent application had already been submitted. Once approved, Zhu Tianlei's actions would be futile.</p><p>"Don't understand? Then we'll see you in court!"</p><p>Saying this, without waiting for Tang Wen to respond, Mao Yu and Hao Xinmei turned around and left, heading straight for the law firm.</p><p>These two people came here solely because they couldn't tolerate their pride being hurt. Having vented their anger, it was now time to get down to business.</p><p>If you bully Zhu Tianlei, don't think you'll have a good life!</p><p>Watching the two figures leave with the lingering fragrance of perfume in the air, Tang Wen's expression darkened.</p><p>Victory belonged to him; no one could take it away!</p><p>Hao Xinmei acted swiftly, and with significant resources spent on connections, infringement proceedings were initiated within just two days. The lawyer representing Zhu Tianlei in court was Yunhaicheng's renowned 'Iron Teeth Copper Teeth' Lei Pan.</p><p>"This..... I don't understand what you're saying; does this beauty have any misunderstanding about me?"</p><p>Tang Wen's face drained of color as he realized the scene did not align with his expectations!</p><p>"No misunderstanding at all! Tang Wen, the lawyer has drafted an infringement document, and you are on your way to jail!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei rushed forward with equally intense eyes.</p><p>"Ladies, I believe there must be some misunderstanding here. I, Tang Wen, have always been law-abiding; I've never done anything out of line. I don't understand at all what you're talking about."</p><p>Jiang was indeed experienced; if Tang Wen had been unaware earlier, he now understood who these two people were targeting.</p><p>But so what?</p><p>Now everyone knew that the medicine was his research, and the patent application had already been submitted. Once approved, Zhu Tianlei's actions would be futile.</p><p>"Don't understand? Then we'll see you in court!"</p><p>Saying this, without waiting for Tang Wen to respond, Mao Yu and Hao Xinmei turned around and left, heading straight for the law firm.</p><p>These two people came here solely because they couldn't tolerate their pride being hurt. Having vented their anger, it was now time to get down to business.</p><p>If you bully Zhu Tianlei, don't think you'll have a good life!</p><p>Watching the two figures leave with the lingering fragrance of perfume in the air, Tang Wen's expression darkened.</p><p>Victory belonged to him; no one could take it away!</p><p>Hao Xinmei acted swiftly, and with significant resources spent on connections, infringement proceedings were initiated within just two days. The lawyer representing Zhu Tianlei in court was Yunhaicheng's renowned 'Iron Teeth Copper Teeth' Lei Pan.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei knew how many women felt, and with Song Bainen's words, he also decided that he couldn't let Tang Wen benefit unfairly.</p><p>On the day of the trial, despite both sides trying to keep a low profile, it still attracted many people to come and listen to the proceedings.</p><p>An elderly woman in her seventies grabbed Zhu Tianlei's arm as soon as he got out of the car and was about to enter the courtroom.</p><p>"Child, this cushion is something I embroidered myself. Take it with you; I know you will win this case!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei found it strange because he didn't recognize this old woman!</p><p>Before he could ask her any questions, he was swept into the courtroom by the crowd.</p><p>He glanced at the cushion in his hand, which featured a pair of lotus blossoms with a red carp beneath them. One could imagine how much effort an elderly woman in her seventies must have put into making such a cushion.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei treasured the cushion and carefully placed it in his bag.</p><p>This was Zhu Tianlei's first time entering a courtroom for such a trial. Tang Wen sat calmly at the defendant's bench, and if not for this matter, Zhu Tianlei truly believed that Tang Wen was a very decent person.</p><p>On the other side, Wei Baoguo sat gloomily in the corner.</p><p>He hated Zhu Tianlei, but he hated Tang Wen even more.</p><p>When he learned about the enmity between the two of them, he suddenly felt like the anger that had been bottled up inside him for so long was finally released. Even though his blood pressure exceeded 190 in the morning and he took two pills to lower it, he forced himself to come and listen to the trial.</p><p>The trial began after the judge read out the procedures and courtroom rules. Lei Pan, as the plaintiff's lawyer, spoke first. It must be said that Lei Pan indeed had excellent oratory skills; his speech left Zhu Tianlei in awe.</p><p>After Lei Pan finished speaking and sat down, Tang Wen slowly stood up.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei is a major suspect in a murder case. Can we trust his testimony?"</p><p>When Tang Wen finished speaking, a buzz of discussion immediately filled the courtroom.</p><p>"Judge, I object. What the defendant is saying is irrelevant to this case and there is no concrete evidence. It appears to be malicious slander. Please allow my application."</p><p>Le Pan was slightly taken aback but quickly reacted.</p><p>"Judge, I believe that if the plaintiff himself is a suspect in a criminal offense and the victim was also a patient treated by the defendant, this should have a direct connection with this case. Please make your ruling, Judge."</p>

						<p>"Phew, go ahead and show off, that's what you call using grass to scare rabbits, right?"</p><p>"Yes, after this incident, apart from getting rid of Mu Kun, it also served as a warning to make County Mayor Yang more cautious. Moreover, the remaining twenty-odd franchisees are all very trusting of Tianlei Medicine, and these people are exactly the partners we need for Tianlei Medicine."</p><p>Mao Yu looked at Zhu Tianlei and couldn't help but marvel again. Zhu Tianlei was like a young sapling growing rapidly in Hamagou's soil, sprouting quickly before she had time to notice, already branching out into a towering tree.</p><p>The business development conference of Tianlei Pharmaceutical signed twenty-seven cooperation agreements, collecting over 500,000 yuan in advance payments on the spot. The expansion of Tianlei Medicine had exceeded Yunhai City and spread to other provinces such as Donghu and Qingliang.</p><p>At the celebration banquet, Zhu Tianlei announced that all employees' bonuses for the month would be doubled, and everyone immediately began admiring this young president.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao officially moved into Tianlei Medicine's dormitory. When he went home to get his luggage, Chen Fanglin tried to stop him, but seeing Zhu Tianlei's gaze, he quickly retracted. Zhu Tianlei had already become his nightmare.</p><p>The decline of Sunshi Pharmaceutical gave Hao Xinmei a great opportunity to expand the market. Meixin Medicine added seventeen new stores within half a month, and Hao Xinmei was so busy that he didn't even have time to make phone calls.</p><p>Tianlei Pharmaceutical's orders surged, and the production workshop worked tirelessly to meet demand, but still couldn't satisfy the huge market needs. However, Mao Yu's management skills were outstanding. Despite the heavy workload, she managed the factory efficiently.</p><p>Without any troubles, Zhu Tianlei became idle. He wandered around daily, feeling somewhat unaccustomed to it.</p><p>One morning, Zhu Tianlei suddenly felt like going out on a whim and thought about how he was still a nominal expert at the county hospital but had never seen a patient yet. So, after greeting Mao Yu and informing Ma Lanlan, he drove his old jeep straight to the county hospital.</p><p>For Zhu Tianlei's sudden appearance, Director Song Boyearsen was even more excited than Yang Hua. He personally escorted Zhu Tianlei to the well-prepared consultation room and carefully briefed the physician assistant accompanying Zhu Tianlei on some matters before leaving with a 'look back every three steps.'</p><p>Bored, Zhu Tianlei sat idly at his desk, chatting briefly with the young assistant. When no one came for a consultation, he got up and walked down the corridor to familiarize himself with the environment.</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei reached the entrance of the outpatient building's staircase, he saw four or five foreigners carrying a person rush in from outside.</p><p>Africans?</p><p>They're really dark!</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei was now the president of a pharmaceutical company, his experience with different cultures was limited. He had never seen such foreign people before—completely black-skinned and shiny, with curly hair and thick lips.</p><p>However, he merely glanced around before preparing to continue his journey of familiarizing himself with the environment.</p><p>"Get out of the way! Are all the doctors dead?"</p><p>Suddenly, a fat man speaking in the dialect of Yunhai City rushed over, his face filled with urgency and mumbling curses.</p><p>"I’m telling you, if anything happens to John today, your county hospital is going to be shut down!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned. Who was this guy? His tone was too arrogant; the county hospital was public property, belonging to the state, and he actually dared to suggest closing it down.</p><p>However, upon hearing his words, the few young doctors standing at the entrance froze in fear.</p><p>"Move out of the way! Don’t you know that a good dog doesn’t block the road?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei stand motionless at the staircase entrance, the fat man grew even more angry and reached out to poke Zhu Tianlei’s chest.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sidestepped, dodging the man's hand. Although the other man deserved a beating, Zhu was officially an expert at the county hospital and did not want to start any conflict.</p><p>The fat man was stunned and attempted to curse again, but a black person next to him said something loudly. The fat man hurriedly bowed his head in respect, nodded, and led several blacks into the emergency building.</p><p>"Do you know that fat man who just left?"</p><p>Seeing the fat man leave, the young doctors visibly sighed with relief. Zhu Tianlei waved them over, and they approached.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei’s identity had already been introduced by Song Bainen at the meeting, but even without his announcement, everyone had become extremely familiar with him after the previous incident.</p><p>Defeating that tigress, Qi Xuelian, was a matter of great satisfaction. The young doctors, seeing Zhu Tianlei call to them, did not hesitate in the slightest.</p><p>"That man is Wan Tao; he’s an investment promotion officer sent down by the city for Daghe County."</p><p>An officer acting so arrogantly?</p><p>Wan Tao, though he was a specialist, his grandfather seemed to be very powerful, almost like a high-ranking official. In short, even the county magistrate treated Wan Tao with extra politeness.</p><p>It turned out that he was from an official family background.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded in understanding. He had just glanced at that foreigner and noticed that he had sustained some external injuries; however, since he was wearing a coat, Zhu could not determine the extent of his injuries. Nevertheless, given Wan Tao's earlier attitude—so arrogant and looking down on others—Zhu decided not to get involved. He didn’t believe that Wan Tao could actually close down the county hospital.</p><p>Since he did not intend to interfere, Zhu Tianlei went straight downstairs, wandered over to the inpatient department, found Yang Hua’s ward, and started chatting with him.</p><p>Suddenly, Yang Hua’s phone rang.</p><p>"Tianlei, the director wants you to come over; there's an emergency..."</p><p>Yang Hua put down the phone with a serious look on his face.</p><p>Song Baiyearn was a doctorate graduate from a national medical university and Yang Hua’s doctoral advisor. He received state medical allowances and was one of the top physicians in Yunhai City, if not the entire country, and also an authority in surgery.</p><p>What kind of emergency could even trouble the director?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt a stir. He had basically guessed who this emergency involved. Originally, he did not want to move, but since it was Song Baiyearn personally calling, there was no way he could refuse.</p><p>"Song Baiyearn, John was sent down by the provincial government and is now in trouble in Dahesi County. I’m telling you, if John dies in your county hospital, you as the director will be held accountable!"</p><p>Outside the ward, Zhu Tianlei and Yang Hua just happened to hear Wan Tao’s words. Zhu Tianlei remained calm, but Yang Hua’s face immediately darkened upon hearing someone speak disrespectfully of his mentor.</p><p>"Wan Tao, you’d better watch your tongue; Director Song is highly respected, about the same age as your father. That’s how you speak to elders?"</p><p>"Yang Hua, is this your turn to speak? Let me tell you clearly that if anything happens to John, none of you will get off scot-free!"</p><p>As Wan Tao spoke, he glared fiercely at Zhu Tianlei. It was clear that he was also addressing Zhu.</p>

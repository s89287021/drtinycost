						<p>Two people stood under the willow tree, talking for a very long time. Mao Yu almost shed all the tears she had accumulated since childhood in one go, until her voice was hoarse and she could no longer speak.</p><p>Mao Yu did not want to see Mao Fang temporarily, and Zhu Tianlei could understand this. Therefore, after watching Mao Yu drive away, he turned around and returned to his ward.</p><p>Mao Fang was still sitting on the chair, even maintaining the posture Zhu Tianlei had left her in. Thinking about Mao Yu's piteous face with tears streaming down like pear blossoms and her voice strained to breaking point, Zhu Tianlei felt a subtle change in his feelings towards Mao Fang.</p><p>"Cough... cough..."</p><p>Seeing that Mao Fang did not react, Zhu Tianlei lightly coughed twice. Mao Fang suddenly turned her head, her eyes frantically searching behind Zhu Tianlei. When she saw only Zhu Tianlei returning alone, her expression immediately darkened.</p><p>"Director Mao, this matter happened too suddenly. Anyone would need a process to accept it, but you don't have to be too anxious. I believe Little Yu will come around."</p><p>"It's my fault that she hates me; I can understand that, but I just want to make up for it properly, to compensate for all the years of my shortcomings towards her."</p><p>Mao Fang was not an ordinary person. Although the massive psychological shock had made her temporarily lose her sanity and emotions border on breaking down, she had quickly composed herself.</p><p>"Director Mao, it's good that you think this way."</p><p>"Tianlei, don't call me Director Mao all the time; just call me Aunt Mao!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei originally wanted to refuse. He did not have any thoughts of climbing higher social ranks, but thinking about Mao Yu, his lips moved slightly, and he finally called out.</p><p>"Aunt Mao."</p><p>"Hmm, Tianlei, could you tell me more about Little Yu? I want to know more..."</p><p>Seeing the longing and pleading in Mao Fang's eyes, Zhu Tianlei could not refuse. He then slowly told her everything he knew about Mao Yu.</p><p>Mao Fang listened intently, occasionally nervously clutching at her sleeve, occasionally shedding a tear, occasionally breaking into a light smile. In short, every experience of Mao Yu caused Mao Fang's emotions to fluctuate. Before they realized it, the two of them had talked until noon.</p><p>"Tianlei, thank you. You not only saved Uncle Qiao but also brought Little Yu to me. This kindness, Aunt will remember forever."</p><p>Mao Fang stood up and looked at Zhu Tianlei, speaking earnestly. In the afternoon, Zhu Tianlei went to check on Qiao Xiang but encountered an unexpected person. He was standing at the corridor entrance when he saw Sun Jianguo enter the ward. Could there be any connection between Qiao Xiang and Sun Jianguo? "Old Qiao, why didn't you come say hello to me even though you came to Yunhai? If it weren't for Lu Paozi telling me that he saw you at the city hospital, I wouldn't have known." It was Sun Jianguo's voice. "I came on a business trip, and my schedule was tight. If not for falling ill in the hospital, I would have already returned by now and wouldn't have troubled all of you." Qiao Xiang's voice, like him, was gentle and refined. "Old Qiao, you're truly being standoffish. Let me ask you, it has been over twenty years since we graduated from college. Several times we invited you to the class reunions, but you never came. Everyone misses that high achiever from the School of Economics and Management at Peking University!" Zhu Tianlei frowned; they were actually college classmates? Then, was Sun Jianguo being backed by Qiao Xiang? He had heard that after the arbitration last time, Sun Jianguo had been called in by the judicial authorities several times. According to normal procedures, it was certain that Sun Jianguo would be involved in a lawsuit, but in the end, he only paid a fine of hundreds of thousands of dollars and the matter was dropped. Hao Xinmei found out through inquiries that there was some powerful figure secretly intervening, pulling Sun Jianguo's strings. Thinking that Qiao Xiang might very well be Sun Jianguo's patron, Zhu Tianlei felt uneasy. Although Qiao Xiang was not Mao Yu's biological father, if Mao Yu and Mao Fang were to reconcile, Qiao Xiang would at least be a stepfather to him. The grievances between Sun Jianguo and himself were not something that could be easily resolved with just a few words. "After I left Yunhai, I rarely came back, and my work was busy. I didn't expect that in the blink of an eye, we would all be reaching middle age." "Indeed, Old Qiao, what happened to you? How did you get sick? Is it serious?"</p><p>Sun Jianguo shifted his focus to Jiao Qiang's illness.</p><p>"Already recovered, I can be discharged soon. Jianguo, do you have anything on your mind?"</p><p>"Eh....."</p><p>Sun Jianguo felt embarrassed but, after thinking it through, realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. He gritted his teeth and spoke up.</p><p>"Old Jiao, you still see right through people's hearts. To be honest, I do need help from Old Jiao. These past years, I've been running a pharmaceutical company. Although we haven't made a fortune, we live comfortably and are among the top taxpayers in Yuhai City."</p><p>Sun Jianguo paused, searching for a good way to approach the topic. Knowing that Jiao Qiang was well-mannered, he continued without interruption.</p><p>"But the business world is like a battlefield, especially when facing stubborn competitors who engage in unfair competition. It's extremely difficult for a company to thrive under such circumstances. I now find myself in this situation, with enemies both ahead and behind me. The enterprise I've operated for so many years seems on the verge of being crushed."</p><p>Sun Jianguo slowed his speech, carefully observing Jiao Qiang's expression, waiting for him to respond. However, Jiao Qiang only smiled faintly without speaking, so Sun Jianguo pushed through with determination.</p><p>"These two companies are overwhelmingly powerful and have used every trick in the book against me. Old Jiao, I really can't take it anymore. Coincidentally, I heard that Yuhai City has a plan to attract investments for its high-tech industrial park this year, aiming to support a batch of emerging enterprises, including pharmaceutical companies. I thought......"</p><p>Sun Jianguo stopped mid-sentence. He had made his point clear and now awaited Jiao Qiang's response. Meanwhile, he pulled out a bank card from his pocket and casually placed it on Jiao Qiang's bedside.</p><p>Jiao Qiang glanced at the bank card, even picking it up to examine it closely in front of him. Sun Jianguo's heart raced.</p><p>"How much is this?"</p><p>"Not much, twenty million yuan. Just a token of my gratitude."</p><p>"What a generous offer!"</p><p>......</p><p>Outside the ward, Zhu Tianlei looked grim, his fists clenched tightly.</p><p>Originally, the two really did plot together. It was his blindness that led him to save Qiao Kàng.</p><p>"Sun Jianguo, I think you know my identity, right?"</p><p>Sun Jianguo saw Qiao Kàng put the bank card back on the bedside table and call out his full name, feeling as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over him.</p><p>But since Qiao Kàng asked, he had no choice but to answer.</p><p>"Yes, Landou told me!"</p><p>Landou mentioned by Sun Jianguo was also their college classmate, now serving as the Deputy Director of Yunhai Investment Bureau. He had a good relationship with Sun Jianguo.</p><p>"Why have I not been in touch with you all these years, even going so far as to come to Yunhai City quietly without making a fuss?"</p><p>Sun Jianguo was taken aback and shook his head.</p><p>Indeed, when he heard about Sun Jianguo's identity from Landou, his jaw dropped in surprise.</p>

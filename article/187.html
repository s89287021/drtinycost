						<p>"I'm tired......"</p><p>Just a few steps in, the girl started throwing a tantrum and stood still.</p><p>"If you can't walk, don't."</p><p>"Then I'll go back home to eat carrots!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei carried the girl without any lingering thoughts. He truly regretted coming to Xiaohexi on a whim today; he wouldn't have cared if someone had picked his ginseng, and he wouldn't have brought this bizarre person back.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei slowly made his way down the mountain with the girl on his back. Before long, he heard a faint snore from behind him.</p><p>Sigh!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sighed, trudging through knee-deep snow towards Tianlei Pharmaceutical.</p><p>Of course, he couldn't bring someone home; it would be too difficult to explain.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei brought the girl back, Mao Yu first widened his eyes and then smirked mischievously.</p><p>"What are you smiling about? This brat is troublesome!"</p><p>Laying the girl on the bed, Zhu Tianlei looked utterly put out.</p><p>"Watch her. I'll check if lunch is ready."</p><p>Saying that, Zhu Tianlei dashed out of the door. Once outside, he suddenly felt how free and fresh the air was.</p><p>With more than two hours until lunch, Zhu Tianlei sat down on a chair in the kitchen preparation room, unwilling to move.</p><p>The workers in the cafeteria were quite uneasy, wondering if they had made any mistakes, but Zhu Tianlei didn't move until it was time to serve food.</p><p>Xiaomu, eat whatever you want, and enjoy it; there are plenty of dishes!</p><p>"Uh-huh, Miss Yuntao, you’re so good!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei watched Zhang Yuntao walking into the canteen with that little troublemaker, chatting and laughing as they went. He couldn’t help but get goosebumps.</p><p>The little troublemaker had changed her clothes; honestly, after putting on a white sweater and tight jeans, she looked quite stunning. However, Zhu Tianlei didn’t feel appreciative at all.</p><p>Seeing the two of them approach, Zhu Tianlei immediately wanted to run away.</p><p>"Tianlei, look, I’ve given Xiaomu a makeover. Isn’t she pretty?"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao called out cheerfully.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei really didn’t want to get close to the little troublemaker, but he couldn’t ignore his own woman either. So, he slowly turned around reluctantly.</p><p>"Yuntao."</p><p>"Tianlei, what’s wrong? Are you not feeling well?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei’s expression, Zhang Yuntao asked worriedly.</p><p>"No, I’m fine. Let’s go and have lunch!"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao had arrived, so there was no point in trying to leave. Besides, Zhang Yuntao’s digestion wasn’t great, so Zhu Tianlei had been taking care of her diet. However, despite his best efforts, he couldn’t guarantee that she would eat three nutritious meals a day.</p><p>"Alright, I’ll take Xiaomu to get some food first. You wait here for us."</p><p>Zhang Yuntao pointed to a spot casually and led the little troublemaker towards the buffet.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei could only sit there with a grim expression.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei usually ate in the cafeteria when he was at work, and he didn't make any special arrangements. He always sat in the main hall with the employees, and basically everyone had eaten with Zhu Tianlei at some point.</p><p>So when they saw Zhu Tianlei sitting there now, everyone came over to greet him. However, everyone felt that the usually amiable and approachable Best Director of the company seemed to have a strange smile today.</p><p>Soon after, Zhang Yuntao returned with Xiaomoxing. The rice in Xiaomoxing's plate was piled high like a mountain, and there were also piles of vegetables on it.</p><p>"That... Xiaomu said she was hungry!"</p><p>Although Zhang Yuntao thought it was somewhat exaggerated, since Xiaomu kept asking the chef to add more rice and dishes, he didn't want to say anything about it.</p><p>While they were eating, Zhu Tianlei found out that Xiaomoxing's last name was Mu, and her full name was Mu Mu. She was seventeen years old.</p><p>"Xiaomu, you......"</p><p>"Big sister Yuntao, I still want to eat......"</p><p>Just as Zhang Yuntao wanted to ask if Mu Mu had eaten too much, she looked at him with a red face, feeling a bit embarrassed and said so.</p><p>Until she finished eating an entire large plate of food, Zhang Yuntao kept her mouth open in surprise, forgetting to put anything into her own mouth.</p><p>Employees dining at other tables were also drawn over by Mu Mu. The cafeteria was silent except for the sound of Mu Mu continuously using chopsticks to bring rice and dishes to her mouth.</p><p>When Mu Mu finally put down her chopsticks, patted her stomach, and announced that she was full, a thunderous applause erupted in the cafeteria.</p><p>From then on, Mu Mu earned the title of 'Big Eater.'</p><p>"Tianlei, where exactly did this Mu Mu come from?"</p><p>A few days later, Zhang Yuntao could no longer hold back. She rarely inquired about Zhu Tianlei's affairs, but now, this Mu Mu was really......</p><p>"To be honest, I don't know either. In the past two days, I've already asked people to find out for me, but there's been no news."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was also headache, this Mu Mu was truly a troublemaker. She either knocked over the medicine in the cabinet or ran into the factory and damaged the conveyor poles. Unfortunately, this girl had a sweet mouth and loved to laugh, so even though she caused trouble every day, she won the affection of everyone in the company, including his woman, Zhang Yuntao.</p><p>"I think little Mu is very lovable. If we can't find her family, why don't we keep her here?" </p><p>Zhang Yuntao had been thinking about this for two days. She grew up without any siblings and was lonely. She had a special bond with little Mu, whom she adored so much that she wanted to keep her around. However, Mu Mu was a full person, not a pet, so she had to consult Zhu Tianlei first.</p><p>"No way!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei outright refused. What kind of joke was this? He couldn't wait to get rid of the little troublemaker.</p><p>If it weren't for Mao Yu and Zhang Yuntao stopping him, he would have driven her deep into a remote forest.</p><p>"Tianlei!"</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei rejected her, Zhang Yuntao's face showed disappointment, and she softly called out his name.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao was very reserved and shy, almost never asking Rui Tianlei for anything. Seeing her dejected face made Zhu Tianlei's heart soften immediately.</p><p>"Yuntao, don't be sad. I... okay, if we can't find her family and she agrees to stay, then we'll keep her."</p><p>"That's wonderful! Thank you, Tianlei!"</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei agree, Zhang Yuntao's face lit up with a smile, and she excitedly kissed his cheek before fluttering away like a butterfly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei touched the spot where Zhang Yuntao had kissed him, smiling helplessly. </p><p>He would try his best to satisfy what his woman wanted.</p><p>In no time, three more days passed, but there was still no news of Mu Mu's family. Zhu Tianlei was ready to tell Zhang Yuntao that they should send her away when he received a phone call. After hanging up, Zhu Tianlei's face looked very grim.</p><p>He clung to the window frame, gazing at the desolate winter scene outside, and clenched his fists tightly.</p>

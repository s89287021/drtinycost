						<p>The clerk was so moved that tears streamed down his face as he looked at Zhu Tianlei with a look of guilt.</p><p>"Hurry up, use more force! The baby's head is almost out!"</p><p>Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, the clerk immediately bent over and looked at his wife's lower body. Sure enough, a small round black head had appeared.</p><p>"I see it, I see it, it's coming out!"</p><p>The clerk shouted in excitement.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, however, did not let his guard down; he knew that this was the crucial moment to remain focused.</p><p>"Waaaaahhhh!"</p><p>The baby's loud cries echoed throughout the entire office hall.</p><p>Hugging his newly born daughter, the clerk trembled with joy and looked at the tiny infant, laughing foolishly.</p><p>A thunderous applause erupted from the crowd. Everyone was thrilled and cheered for what they had just witnessed; not everyone had the opportunity to witness the birth of a new life.</p><p>"Benefactor, thank you! I, Wu Hongqiang, on behalf of my family of three, thank you for saving our lives!"</p><p>Hugging his newly born daughter, the clerk glanced at his wife and suddenly dropped to his knees, bowing deeply to Zhu Tianlei in gratitude.</p><p>"Hurry up and get up; the safety of both mother and child is what matters most!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stopped Wu Hongqiang, speaking sincerely.</p><p>This was his second time delivering a baby, yet he felt just as elated and excited as before. Although he had previously felt humiliation and resentment, all negative emotions dissipated with the birth of this child.</p><p>"Benefactor, I have decided that my daughter's name will be Wu Tianen, so she will always remember her benefactor and always carry a grateful heart."</p><p>The clerk was overwhelmed with emotion as tears streamed down his face, his gaze filled with guilt towards Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Hurry up, use more force! The baby’s head is almost out!"</p><p>Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, the clerk bent over immediately and looked at his wife's lower body. Indeed, a small round black head was emerging.</p><p>"I see it, I see it! It's coming out!"</p><p>The clerk shouted in excitement.</p><p>Despite the urgency, Zhu Tianlei remained focused; this moment required utmost care.</p><p>"Waaaaahhhh!"</p><p>The baby’s loud cries echoed throughout the entire office hall.</p><p>Hugging his newly born daughter, the clerk trembled with joy and looked at the tiny infant, laughing foolishly.</p><p>A thunderous applause erupted from those around him. Everyone was thrilled and cheered for what they had just witnessed; not everyone has the opportunity to see a new life come into the world.</p><p>"Benefactor, thank you! I, Wu Hongqiang, on behalf of my family of three, thank you for saving our lives!"</p><p>Hugging his newly born daughter, the clerk glanced at his wife and suddenly dropped to his knees, bowing deeply towards Zhu Tianlei in gratitude.</p><p>"Hurry up and get up; the safety of both mother and child is what matters most!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stopped Wu Hongqiang, speaking sincerely.</p><p>This was his second delivery, yet he felt just as elated and excited as before. Despite previous feelings of humiliation and resentment, all negative emotions dissipated with the birth of this child.</p><p>"Benefactor, I have decided that my daughter's name will be Wu Tianen, so she will always remember her benefactor and carry a grateful heart."</p><p>Moved to tears, the clerk looked at Zhu Tianlei with deep guilt.</p><p>"Hurry up, use more force! The baby’s head is almost out!"</p><p>Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei’s words, the clerk bent over immediately and gazed at his wife's lower body. Indeed, a small, round black head was beginning to emerge.</p><p>"I see it, I see it! It’s coming out!"</p><p>The clerk shouted in excitement.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained vigilant; this was a critical moment that required utmost care.</p><p>"Waaaaahhhh!"</p><p>The baby’s loud cries echoed throughout the entire office hall.</p><p>Hugging his newly born daughter, the clerk trembled with joy and looked at the tiny infant, laughing foolishly.</p><p>A thunderous applause erupted from those around him. Everyone was thrilled and cheered for what they had just witnessed; not everyone has the opportunity to witness a new life being born.</p><p>"Benefactor, thank you! I, Wu Hongqiang, on behalf of my family of three, thank you for saving our lives!"</p><p>Hugging his newly born daughter, the clerk glanced at his wife and suddenly dropped to his knees, bowing deeply towards Zhu Tianlei in gratitude.</p><p>"Hurry up and get up; the safety of both mother and child is what matters most!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stopped Wu Hongqiang, speaking sincerely.</p><p>This was his second delivery, yet he felt just as elated and excited as before. Despite previous feelings of humiliation and resentment, all negative emotions dissipated with the birth of this child.</p><p>"Benefactor, I have decided that my daughter's name will be Wu Tianen, so she will always remember her benefactor and carry a grateful heart."</p><p>Wu Hongqiang climbed step by step from being a poor child to his current position, having witnessed too much human indifference. Thus, his heart gradually turned cold and hard. However, the birth of his daughter made him rediscover the beauty of society and the long-lost warmth of humanity.</p><p>"The silver needles on the woman in labor are used to stop bleeding; do not move within three hours to avoid excessive blood loss. After three hours, she will recover normally."</p><p>Wu Hongqiang nodded repeatedly. Several female colleagues from different offices came over to help clean up the dirt and blood on Wu Hongqiang's wife’s body. Someone brought in a swivel chair, placed her in it, and directly took her to the rest room.</p><p>"Alright, I'll be leaving now!"</p><p>With the matter resolved, Zhu Tianlei did not intend to stay any longer. Three million was undoubtedly an astronomical figure to him.</p><p>Wu Hongqiang felt slightly bitter inside. Capital verification was a necessary step for registering a company, and he had no way around it.</p><p>"The capital verification funds have been credited to the account; please proceed with the normal procedures!"</p><p>Suddenly, Mao Yu approached, causing Zhu Tianlei’s heart to skip a beat. What kind of international joke was this? Three million yuan, not three thousand or thirty thousand!</p><p>"Remember to pay me back later!"</p><p>As he passed by Zhu Tianlei, Mao Yu whispered something.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not react for a while.</p><p>Did Mao Yu make the payment?</p><p>Why?</p><p>Were they very close friends?</p><p>Hearing that the capital verification funds had arrived, Wu Hongqiang was also delighted and even forgot that he was holding the child. He was about to go into the counter to handle procedures for Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Hongqiang, quickly go accompany your sister-in-law. Don't worry, I will definitely smoothly complete the registration procedures for our big niece’s savior!"</p><p>The person who had called 120 stepped forward. Wu Hongqiang's face turned red; he was clearly very excited.</p><p>"Hero, I will be on my way now. This is my phone number. No matter what happens in the future, as long as you, Hero, speak, Wu Hongqiang will be willing to brave fire and water."</p><p>Thanks to Zhu Tianlei's glorious deeds, the registration process was unexpectedly smooth. All procedures were handled via a fast track, and within an hour, the company license was placed in Zhu Tianlei's hands.</p><p>Looking at the words 'Tianlei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.' on the license, which still carried the scent of ink, Zhu Tianlei also felt quite excited.</p><p>"Thank you! I will repay you as soon as possible!"</p><p>After calming down from his excitement, Zhu Tianlei sincerely told Mao Yu.</p><p>"There's no need. President Min has already wired the verification funds to me. He asked me to tell you that this money can be considered a loan or an investment. It's up to you how to decide!"</p><p>Mao Yu's face remained cold, but in Zhu Tianlei's eyes, it seemed warmer.</p><p>"Alright, I will call President Min myself. Even so, I still need to thank you!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was sincere. He wasn't just grateful that Mao Yu had lent him money for verification; he was also thankful for Mao Yu's support during the critical moment.</p><p>"If you really want to thank me, then agree to one condition of mine!"</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei answered promptly.</p><p>Repaying kindness with gratitude was his guiding principle in life.</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei's solemn and serious expression, Mao Yu couldn't help but laugh. Mao Yu rarely smiled, but when he did, it felt like the haze had cleared, revealing clear skies and bright moonlight.</p><p>"I want to be an enterprise consultant for Tianlei Pharmaceutical."</p><p>What?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei never expected that Mao Yu's condition would be this. Was he joking? This was clearly a gift from the heavens, right?</p><p>"How about it? Not willing?"</p><p>"Willing, willing, willing..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded like a garlic clove; only an idiot wouldn't be willing!</p><p>Although he didn't know Mao Yu's true identity, he knew she must be extraordinary. As someone who knew nothing, it was unimaginable for him to run a company, but with Mao Yu by his side, everything would be different!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei held the license and other documents, following Mao Yu with a foolish smile as they both exited the administrative approval hall.</p><p>No one noticed the middle-aged man standing behind the glass railing on the second-floor lobby, his gaze continuously following Zhu Tianlei, lost in thought.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei wanted to invite Mao Yu for dinner to express his gratitude, but she directly declined. Zhu Tianlei didn't insist; after leaving the approval hall, they went their separate ways.</p><p>After some thought, Zhu Tianlei took out his phone and called Min Shengjun.</p><p>Min Shengjun's response regarding the three million dollars was consistent with what Mao Yu had said, also advising Zhu Tianlei not to feel any burden. He believed that Zhu Tianlei would definitely make his money grow, even double it.</p><p>When he heard that Mao Yu would be an advisor for Tianlei Pharmaceutical, Min Shengjun was surprised and then burst into laughter.</p><p>"Tianlei, you really have charm! Do you know who Mao Yu is? She's the 'Black Mare Goddess' of Wall Street in America. Companies queue up daily to consult her, with her consultation fees starting at a minimum of $5000 per hour, not including other fees. You managed to get her; what an impressive young man you are!"</p><p>Min Shengjun's words echoed in Zhu Tianlei's ears.</p><p>He took out his phone and searched for the latest exchange rate between USD and RMB.</p><p>"1:6.6, $5000, that would be... 33,000 yuan?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was so surprised he almost bit his tongue. This was real money-making! </p><p>Such a unicorn goddess, really wants to become my business consultant?</p><p>Broad daylight, Zhu Tianlei pinched his arm hard.</p><p>"Ouch!"</p><p>It hurt!</p><p>So this must be true, not a dream!</p>

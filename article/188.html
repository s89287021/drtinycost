						<p>The call was from Hao Xinmei.</p><p>In addition to Meiyandan, Tianlei Pharmaceutical's main product line now includes a new weight-loss and health supplement for women called Bichingdan, which has sales comparable to those of Meiyandan.</p><p>Initially, there were many counterfeit drugs on the market, but due to different formulas, their efficacy was severely compromised. Moreover, Mao Yu's relentless crackdown on fake medicines meant that these counterfeits were merely fleeting phenomena, unable to withstand scrutiny.</p><p>This time, however, the counterfeit Bichingdan appearing on the market is indistinguishable from the genuine product in both packaging and efficacy, causing unprecedented impact on Hao Xinmei's affiliated pharmacies.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei thought for a moment before calling Mao Yu. Before he could even connect, Mao Yu rushed into the room, slamming down several boxes of medicine onto Zhu Tianlei's desk with a flourish.</p><p>"Tianlei, look at this! I'm so furious!"</p><p>Mao Yu sat down heavily in the chair, his cheeks flushed red from coming in from outside.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei picked up the boxes on the table; they were indeed Bichingdan.</p><p>He examined the medicine box thoroughly, inside and out. Indeed, the counterfeit was extremely well-made; even the verification codes could not be distinguished. He opened the box and took out a Bichingdan pill, sniffing it and finding that its smell matched his own formulation exactly.</p><p>"Tianlei, I just scanned the QR code, and damn it, it showed as genuine! This is simply witchcraft!"</p><p>Since returning to China, especially after coming to Hamagou, Mao Yu's temper had flared up significantly, occasionally letting slip some of the coarse language of the women in Hamagou, his tone vividly imitating theirs.</p><p>"Indeed, the components are exactly the same as ours."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei also looked grave.</p><p>He was very confident in his formulations and had kept his recipe secret to prevent such situations. Each batch sent to the processing workshop was a semi-finished product, known only to a few individuals. His women and Mao Yu certainly did not know it; apart from them...</p><p>Yao Jianxiong?</p><p>Since Yao Jianxiong handled the harvesting and transportation of medicinal herbs, and all incoming herbs were inspected by him, Zhu Tianlei trusted him greatly. Therefore, besides Mao Yu and Zhang Yuntao, the only person who knew the recipe was Yao Jianxiong.</p><p>It was impossible.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not believe it. Although Yao Jianxiong was young, he had always been very cautious and reliable. In the past six months, Zhu Tianlei had placed great trust in him. However, apart from Yao Jianxiong, who else could it be?</p><p>"Tianlei, this matter is no small thing. The report I brought back from the marketing department shows that our Bilinqidan sales have dropped by 40% over the past ten days, resulting in direct losses of around 4 million yuan. While that's bad enough, now that the medicine is under Tianlei Pharmaceutical's name, if any issues arise, we would bear the responsibility."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, of course, understood what Mao Yu was saying.</p><p>"Xiaoyu, let's go!"</p><p>Mao Yu followed Zhu Tianlei out of the company without understanding why. The car sped directly towards the largest pharmaceutical wholesale market in Yunhai City.</p><p>A pharmaceutical wholesale market was essentially a concentrated area for various pharmaceutical companies. While other cities were not discussed here, at least half of Yunhai City's medications passed through this market to reach different pharmacies.</p><p>As soon as Mao Yu and Zhu Tianlei got out of the car, they were approached by a man.</p><p>"Sir, are you in the medicine business?"</p><p>The speaker was a short man who did not look particularly handsome but had sharp eyes. He had a small nose and round face, dressed in a short woolen jacket with gray casual pants, and was around thirty years old.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stopped and nodded.</p><p>People like this were called pharmaceutical sales representatives from a human resources perspective, but in the industry jargon, they were known as drug dealers, specifically the most grassroots level.</p><p>"Are you pharmacy owners or secondary agents?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hesitated slightly.</p><p>"We own pharmacies and came to see if there are any new weight-loss and health products specifically for women."</p><p>"Two of you, what a coincidence. Come, come, let's step aside and talk."</p><p>The small man was clearly very smooth and adaptable. After speaking, he led Zhu Tianlei and Mao Yu into a nearby alleyway. He looked around before turning back.</p><p>"Have you two heard of Qingdan?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled inwardly but didn't show it on his face.</p><p>"Of course, Qingdan is now the best-selling weight-loss and health supplement on the market, but the supply channels are too narrow, and the purchase price is high. The profit margin is too......"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pretended to be very troubled. The more he acted this way, the more the small man felt his chance had come.</p><p>"Yes, yes, Qingdan's sales aren't as good as general medicines, but the supply channels are dominated by Meixin Pharmaceuticals alone, and the retail prices are uniformly managed, so there is no profit, of course. However, I now have a medicine that is exactly like Qingdan. Little brother, wouldn't you like to know more about it?"</p><p>The small man clearly had years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry and was very skilled at sales tactics. He didn't make people feel disgusted while subtly arousing their interest.</p><p>"Brother, are you saying this is a fake medicine?"</p><p>"Eh, what does little brother mean by that? What's a fake medicine? Medicine that doesn't work is a fake medicine. The medicine I recommend to little brother is exactly like the real Qingdan. You can even check it online and won't be able to tell the difference, and the ingredients are completely the same. However, the wholesale price is only half of Meixin Pharmaceuticals."</p><p>The small man lowered his voice but didn't lose any enthusiasm.</p><p>"Half?"</p><p>"Yes, think about it. With a purchase price that is half as much, based on Qingdan's current sales situation, even a small pharmacy can sell dozens of boxes a day and over ten thousand boxes a year. What do you think the profit would be?"</p><p>Mao Yu, standing behind Zhu Tianlei, was so angry that her face turned pale.</p><p>She had lived in America for several years and had seen many business competition tactics. Her heart had long been hardened against them, but seeing the small man boldly recommending fake Qingdan to them with such passion made her want to curse.</p><p>Feeling Mao Yu's emotions behind him, Zhu Tianlei gently pulled on her sleeve with his finger.</p><p>"Yes, the profit is really tempting, but......"</p><p>"Little brother, are you worried about being responsible if someone gets sick from using it?"</p><p>"Yes, nowadays, people's legal awareness is particularly strong. They all know about rights protection. If someone does get sick, my profits won't even cover the compensation!"</p><p>"Haha, little brother, I can tell you're new to this. Let me ask you, which pharmaceutical company produces Qinglingdan?"</p><p>"Tianlei Pharmaceutical, of course. Why would you need to ask?"</p><p>"That's right, Qinglingdan is produced by Tianlei Pharmaceutical. If there are any issues, it's their responsibility, not yours. What are you afraid of? I tell you, even if the boss of Tianlei Pharmaceutical came here, they wouldn't be able to tell which ones are fake and which ones they produced themselves!"</p><p>The shorter man got more excited as he spoke, thumping his chest loudly.</p>

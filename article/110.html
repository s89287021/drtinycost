						<p>"Boss, the person looking for me is Tang Qingshan. You must be careful with this guy, and it seems like there are people behind him."</p><p>Zhang Qiang thought for a moment before saying firmly, "Tang Qingshan?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't expect this matter to be connected with Tang Qingshan. Recalling what Yao Gang had said earlier, Zhu Tianlei's heart sank. Could all these things have been orchestrated by Sun Jianguo?</p><p>On one hand, Zhu Tianlei was shocked; on the other hand, he felt furious.</p><p>Was there really so much hatred between him and Sun Jianguo? Hao Xinhui remarked that Sun Jiang had basically recovered and that the hospital said there would be no aftereffects. Why did Sun Jianguo need to torment him so relentlessly, even going as far as extermination?</p><p>After leaving the hospital, Zhu Tianlei received calls from Chief Wu and Qi Lian. Chief Wu simply informed him of the outcome of the matter, which turned out to be a misunderstanding. Qi Lian, on the other hand, was ecstatic on the phone, congratulating Zhu Tianlei repeatedly, which made Zhu Tianlei develop a favorable impression of Qi Lian.</p><p>Following that, Ma Yu called.</p><p>Since their little disagreement, the relationship between the two had grown even closer, transitioning from a professional one to friendship.</p><p>The happiest about the outcome was undoubtedly Ma Yu. She surprisingly screamed with excitement on the phone, making Zhu Tianlei both laugh and cry. It seemed that women, regardless of their success or dominance in their careers, were still like children at heart—Black Horse Goddess included.</p><p>With the matter resolved, the project was immediately restored to normal.</p><p>After this incident, all the workers admired Zhu Tianlei even more. Not only was their boss skilled in medicine but also extremely responsible towards his workers. Everyone had heard about what happened in the hospital, so when they went back to work, they were even more dedicated and hardworking.</p><p>At that moment, Zhu Tianlei and Ma Yu stood on an open piece of land, looking at the production building rising higher with each passing day. Both their faces carried smiles.</p><p>This was the result of their joint efforts, like watching a sapling grow through storms to become lush with leaves and flowers. This sense of achievement could only be understood by those who were part of it.</p><p>"Boss... Boss, Liang brought a bunch of people..."</p><p>The maid in charge of cooking lived in the workers' shed with her son, who mainly handled shopping and other menial tasks. The person reporting this news was his son, who had just finished shopping when he encountered those people.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei and Mao Yu glanced at each other, and to their surprise, both burst into laughter, though the smiles held different meanings.</p><p>It seemed that good things often came with many trials; one wave had yet to settle when another rose!</p><p>Mao Yu, having long been in the business world, was familiar with the tactics used between competitors, so he wasn't overly surprised. Moreover, knowing about Sun Jianguo's existence from Zhu Tianlei, he was mentally prepared.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei needed no guesswork; he already knew who these people were sent by.</p><p>Ten minutes later, this group appeared grandly in front of Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at them indifferently.</p><p>The leader was still that hulking brute, but the scale of this operation was clearly much larger. A rough estimate put the number at around fifty people, all wielding weapons.</p><p>"Are you Tang Qingshan?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the hulking brute in front of him and asked sternly.</p><p>Tang Qingshan's body trembled; he hadn't expected Zhu Tianlei to guess his identity so quickly. Still, what could be done about it? Today, his goal was to destroy this place thoroughly.</p><p>"Hmph, who I am doesn't matter. What matters is that after today, your Tianlei Pharmaceutical will no longer exist. Brothers, give me a hand!"</p><p>Tang Qingshan was extremely arrogant; his arrogance stemmed from the fact that everyone he had brought along was well-trained and willing to risk their lives. How could Zhu Tianlei handle fifty people alone?</p><p>The men behind Tang Qingshan, upon hearing his orders, immediately rushed forward with their weapons.</p><p>The workers, who were already fully engaged in construction, were dumbfounded once again. What on earth was happening?</p><p>They were seasoned workers in the construction industry, some having worked for years or even decades, and they had never seen a construction site so complicated before. And judging by the current situation, it seemed to be far more serious than last time!</p><p>"Mao Yu, stop the workers first and have them all go into the sheds."</p><p>Now, Zhu Tianlei addressed Mao Yu by his name directly instead of calling him "Mr. Mao, Mr. Mao." Mao Yu found it much more comfortable to hear that.</p><p>"Tiānlěi..."</p><p>"Don't worry, I don't even consider those shrimp soldiers and crab generals worth my attention."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei wasn't just consoling Mao Yu; he genuinely didn't think much of them.</p><p>Tang Qingshan felt humiliated beyond words. In Donghu Lake, he was a renowned big boss; no one dared to defy him. However, in this Yunhai City, he had become someone anyone could trample on, even inferior to his own subordinates.</p><p>"If you think about leaving, none of you are allowed to go. Since you don't take us seriously, I, Tang Qingshan, will show you what it means to be Lord Marquis Three Eyes—smash! Smash them all!"</p><p>Tang Qingshan's chest was burning with anger. Since someone else would bear the responsibility, he, Tang Qingshan, had nothing to fear; even if they killed him, he wouldn't back down.</p><p>Seeing these people rushing over with weapons in hand, the workers who couldn't hide in time were trembling all over. Some stood on the planks frozen in shock, not knowing what to do.</p><p>"You asked for it!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei let out a cold snort and acted immediately. In a split second, he grabbed Tang Qingshan by the wrist. This time, he didn't mince words; he held Tang Qingshan aloft over his head.</p><p>Capture the leader first to capture the bandits; Zhu Tianlei knew this well.</p><p>Tang Qingshan's fury was instantly quenched.</p><p>He froze!</p><p>With wide eyes, he stared at the world suddenly inverted before him. It took him a while to realize that Zhu Tianlei was holding him aloft and that he hadn't even noticed when Zhu Tianlei had moved beside him.</p><p>"If any of you dare move again, his life will be as worthless as this piece of blue brick."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei held Tang Qingshan up with one foot on a blue brick. In an instant, everyone's gaze fell upon that blue brick.</p><p>There was no wind.</p><p>There was no sound.</p><p>The blue bricks under Zhu Tianlei's feet slowly cracked, gradually breaking into several pieces, and then slowly turned into a pile of powder.</p><p>This process was long, so long that it seemed time had frozen. Yet, this process was also quick, as if it had happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Tang Qingshan swallowed hard but almost choked himself on his saliva.</p><p>What should he do?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was too terrifying, almost not human. And Tang Qingshan believed that Zhu Tianlei would really treat him like a brick and get rid of him.</p><p>But what about Sun Jianguo? He had taken 300,000 yuan from him and signed a life-and-death contract. Most of the 300,000 yuan had been squandered by him. If he failed, Tang Qingshan believed that Sun Jianguo could also kill him.</p><p>Tang Qingshan's heart was in turmoil, struggling between two extremes. As he thought about it, if things somehow succeeded, he would still be able to get 300,000 yuan. Thirty thousand yuan would be enough for the rest of his life, and even though Zhu Tianlei was very powerful, he had no background. Would he really dare to kill?</p><p>There was no wind.</p><p>There was no sound.</p><p>The blue bricks under Zhu Tianlei's feet slowly cracked, breaking into pieces, and finally turned into a pile of powder.</p><p>This process seemed endless, as if time itself had frozen. Yet, it was also incredibly swift, almost instantaneous.</p><p>Tang Qingshan swallowed hard but nearly choked on his saliva.</p><p>What should he do?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was terrifying, almost inhuman. Tang Qingshan believed that Zhu Tianlei would treat him like a brick and eliminate him.</p><p>But what about Sun Jianguo? He had taken 300,000 yuan from him and signed a life-and-death contract. Most of the money had been wasted by him. If he failed, Tang Qingshan knew that Sun Jianguo could kill him too.</p><p>Tang Qingshan's heart was torn between two extremes, struggling with his thoughts. He wondered if things somehow succeeded, he would still get 300,000 yuan. Thirty thousand yuan would be enough for the rest of his life. Zhu Tianlei might be powerful, but he lacked a background. Would he really dare to kill?</p><p>There was no wind.</p><p>No sound.</p><p>The blue bricks beneath Zhu Tianlei's feet slowly cracked, breaking into pieces and finally dissolving into a pile of dust.</p><p>This process felt eternal, as if time itself had frozen. Yet, it was also shockingly swift, happening in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Tang Qingshan swallowed hard, nearly choking on his saliva.</p><p>What should he do?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was terrifying, almost inhuman. Tang Qingshan believed that Zhu Tianlei would treat him like a mere brick and dispose of him without mercy.</p><p>But what about Sun Jianguo? He had taken 300,000 yuan from him and signed a life-and-death contract. Most of the money had been squandered by him. If he failed, Tang Qingshan knew that Sun Jianguo could kill him as well.</p><p>Tang Qingshan's heart was torn between two extremes, struggling with his thoughts.

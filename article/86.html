						<p>Zhu Tianlei slowly walked over.</p><p>"Lotus, how was it? Wasn't I good just now?"</p><p>"Pah, old man, you're only thinking about yourself..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was stunned. Those two voices were Sun Dafu and Hu Jia's second wife, these two...</p><p>Thinking this, Zhu Tianlei silently moved forward another step, just in time to see the two people hugging each other.</p><p>"Hehe... You really don't recognize me when you're drunk!"</p><p>Sun Dafu said as he buried his old face into Pu Lotus' body. From Zhu Tianlei's angle, he could see Pu Lotus' front clearly and couldn't help but inwardly whistling in admiration.</p><p>Pu Lotus, at around thirty years old, was very well taken care of, with skin as white as snow and two mountains as vast as the sea, much more attractive than the average village woman.</p><p>"Lotus, it's still early, let's do it again!!"</p><p>Sun Dafu had a silver smile on his face. He slapped Pu Lotus' buttocks with a big hand and then got back to it, actually doing it again.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei watched, feeling parched and tongue-tied, but he somehow felt oddly good.</p><p>The two people in the grass became more and more passionate, and Zhu Tianlei watched with great interest.</p><p>After about ten minutes, the two people started shaking wildly in each other's arms. Zhu Tianlei knew they were done, so he pulled out a blade of grass, put it in his mouth, and listened as the two continued their silver-tongued banter in the grass.</p><p>Some time later.</p><p>"Lotus, you go first, I'll come out later. You're really fat, hehe!"</p><p>Indeed, the older one gets, the more mischievous they become. Just before leaving, Sun DaFu couldn't resist giving Pu Lianhua a squeeze on her buttocks.</p><p>Only after Pu Lianhua hurriedly left the grassland did Sun DaFu crawl out from the bushes.</p><p>"Uncle DaFu, still as vigorous and full of vigor as ever!"</p><p>Sun DaFu walked away with a satisfied look, laughing sinisterly, when he suddenly heard a voice beside him, startling him.</p><p>Turning his head, he saw it was Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"What are you talking nonsense about?"</p><p>"You're talking nonsense? Uncle DaFu just had such an intense encounter with Aunt Lianhua, and you've already forgotten so quickly?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei laughed heartily, but Sun DaFu's face darkened.</p><p>"W-what did you see?"</p><p>Sun DaFu still clung to a shred of hope. After all, he had been intimate with Pu Lianhua for two years without anyone ever catching wind of it.</p><p>"I saw everything that should and shouldn't be seen, heard everything that should and shouldn't be heard. The only question is what Aunt DaFu would think if she knew about this."</p><p>Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei mention his wife, Sun DaFu immediately panicked.</p><p>He was a son-in-law who had married into the family, owning neither the house nor the land. Furthermore, his wife was known throughout the village as a formidable woman. If she found out, he would be in big trouble.</p><p>"Cousin, look, we're neighbors living here together. As your senior uncle, please pretend you didn't see anything, okay?"</p><p>Sun DaFu knew for sure that Zhu Tianlei had seen everything. He couldn't afford to take the risk, so he could only grovel and plead.</p><p>"Neighbors? Uncle DaFu, when I was thrown on the mountain by my father and came back alone, did you think about neighbors then? Or when rumors spread that my father's leg injury was due to showing off, did you ever mention these four words?"</p><p>Sun Dafu's face turned pale. This matter had already passed more than a decade, and he truly hadn't expected to end up in Zhu Tianlei's hands one day. If he had known this would happen, he definitely would have been more restrained back then.</p><p>"Big nephew, it was Uncle Daful who was wrong back then. Big nephew, don't be like your uncle, okay?"</p><p>Sun Dafu really did know how to bend and stretch. However, Zhu Tianlei harbored old grievances and had new demands; he couldn't just let the matter pass with a few kind words from the other party.</p><p>"What Uncle Daful is saying isn’t right at all. I'm the junior, how could I dare to compare myself with Uncle Daful? Rest assured, I definitely won't spread rumors like Uncle Daful did. I will definitely tell Auntie Daful the truth about this matter."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei finished speaking and turned to leave. Sun Dafu was so scared his legs went weak.</p><p>"Big nephew, big nephew, don’t rush off! We can still discuss things. Look, what can I do to let you go this time?"</p><p>A sneer flashed across Zhu Tianlei's mind, but he remained expressionless on the outside.</p><p>"What Uncle Daful is saying, I don't understand. I just find your actions distasteful. What’s there to negotiate about?"</p><p>"That's not right, big nephew. Look, how about if I give you two thousand yuan, then you can pretend you didn’t see this happen, okay?"</p><p>Sun Dafu said in pain.</p><p>"Uncle Daful, Zhu Tianlei isn't short of that amount of money."</p><p>"Wait a minute, 5000, 5000 yuan, okay?"</p><p>Sun Dafu was truly desperate. If his wife found out about this matter, it wouldn’t just be a matter of 5000 yuan. Moreover, as long as he could keep Zhu Tianlei at bay for now, he would find a way to get the money back later.</p><p>"Uncle Daful, are you really willing to negotiate with me?"</p><p>"Yes yes yes, of course I am."</p><p>Seeing that Zhu Tianlei was somewhat wavering, Sun Dafu quickly responded.</p><p>"That's fine, I want the eight mu of land on Uncle Liang Gangzi's property."</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Sun Dafu refused immediately without thinking; that land was for his retirement and could not be given away.</p><p>"Let's talk about this at your uncle's house later!"</p><p>"You… wait!"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei turn to leave, Sun Dafu panicked again.</p><p>"Other than that, there's nothing else to discuss."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's attitude was firm, his gaze unusually cold. After an intense struggle in Sun Dafu's heart, he gritted his teeth and nodded.</p><p>"Alright, but I can't make this decision on my own; I need to go home and talk to your aunt."</p><p>"Fine! I'll wait for Uncle Dafu's message!"</p><p>Sun Dafu scratched his head.</p><p>"Cousin, you…"</p><p>"Don't worry, Uncle Dafu. I only want the land; I didn't see anything else."</p><p>With that said, Zhu Tianlei turned and left. This time, Sun Dafu did not speak, watching as Zhu Tianlei's figure disappeared at the turn of the meadow.</p><p>"Sigh, damn it!"</p><p>Muttering under his breath, Sun Dafu limped out of the meadow.</p><p>With the earlier incident, Zhu Tianlei was in a good mood, whistling as he walked briskly. Sun Dafu's eight-tenths of an acre had been secured. He still needed to carefully consider the remaining one and two-tenths of an acre. After much thought, it seemed that Yao Gang would have to help with this matter.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei first went to the village office, but Yao Gang was not there. Zhu then went to Yao Gang's house, where he was greeted by Yao Gang's son, Yao Jianxiong.</p><p>The nineteen-year-old Yao Jianxiong looked almost identical to his father, a younger version of Yao Gang, just slightly taller. Seeing Zhu Tianlei, Yao Jianxiong appeared very happy.</p>

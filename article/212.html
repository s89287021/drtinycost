						<p>Seeing his son lead the woman who had been standing at the door earlier into the house, Zhu Quezi's old face turned bright red with embarrassment.</p><p>Mao Fang was no fool; she immediately understood what had happened.</p><p>"It's all my fault. I thought nobody was home, so I went to the entrance of the alley..."</p><p>This statement was clearly an attempt to provide Zhu Quezi with a way out.</p><p>"Tianlei, this is......"</p><p>"Mao Aunt is from Yundai Province......"</p><p>"Brother, I am Mao Yu's aunt. You can just call me Big Sister."</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was about to introduce Mao Fang, she cut him off.</p><p>"Oh, oh, so you're Xiao Mao's aunt. Please sit down, please sit down."</p><p>Zhu Quezi had a good impression of Mao Fang and quickly got up, pulling a chair in front of her.</p><p>"I came to visit during the New Year, causing trouble for Brother."</p><p>"What trouble? None at all. I really cherish Xiao Mao and your sister-in-law; he's very smart and responsible. To put it bluntly, he's like our own daughter. Does Big Sister also live in Yundai City?"</p><p>Mentioning Mao Yu, Zhu Quezi became more talkative.</p><p>His fondness for Mao Yu was not just polite words; both Hou Suxin and Zhu Quezi loved him immensely, especially Hou Suxin, who smiled whenever she saw him.</p><p>"I've been away on a trip and only returned to visit my family. I wanted to come see Mao Yu."</p><p>Since their last parting at the hospital, Mao Yu and Mao Fang had not seen each other. Mao Fang called Zhu Tianlei twice but did not directly seek out Mao Yu. It must be said that this woman, Mao Fang, was level-headed, knew how to step back, and understood how to consider others, which was very rare.</p><p>"Oh, Tianlei, didn't Xiao Mao go to her classmate's place? Why didn't she call Xiao Mao before coming over?"</p><p>Mao Fang's face was slightly awkward.</p><p>If she had called ahead of time, Mao Yu would probably have avoided her, and she wouldn't have been able to see him at all.</p><p>"I already called Mao Yu. She'll be back soon, Dad. Didn't you say Uncle Tan wanted you to help build a pigsty? It's almost noon."</p><p>"Yes, oh no, I'm getting too old for this; I nearly forgot about it. Big sister, please sit down. Have lunch at home today, and I'll go fetch your younger sister!"</p><p>Zhu Quezi finished speaking, casually pulled off his dogskin cap, wrapped himself in the long army coat, and rushed out the door.</p><p>"Aunt Mao, I'll call Xiao Yu for you. Wait....."</p><p>"Tianlei, I didn't come specifically to see Xiao Yu."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Rui Tianlei was stunned. If she wasn't here to see Mao Yu, could it be that she was looking for him?</p><p>"I have found out about the incident when you were arrested last time."</p><p>What?</p><p>Mao Fang actually still remembered this? He had completely forgotten about it.</p><p>"The person who framed you is named Qiu Ran. You should know him, right?"</p><p>Rui Tianlei's face darkened involuntarily; it was really him.</p><p>"It's more than just knowing him."</p><p>"That’s no wonder, a mere deputy head of the county public security bureau daring to interfere in the city bureau's case is truly audacious."</p><p>Mao Fang’s eyes flashed, and her entire demeanor became extremely intimidating, living up to being the wife of the provincial secretary.</p><p>"The man has already been detained by me. After the government departments resume work on the eighth day, I will personally go to the city bureau to investigate this matter thoroughly."</p><p>Seeing Mao Fang's unusually solemn expression, Zhu Tianlei couldn’t help but inwardly marvel. He now understood where Mao Yu inherited her character from; with such a powerful mother, it was strange if she were not domineering.</p><p>However, he had to admit that Zhu Tianlei was somewhat moved as well.</p><p>"Oh Aunt Mao, there’s still one more thing I would like to bring up to you..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei and Mao Fang talked for more than an hour, but in the end, Mao Fang did not see Mao Yu, which left her somewhat disappointed.</p><p>"Tianlei, let’s meet on the eighth day!"</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei insisted on seeing Mao Fang off to the village entrance, but she refused his insistence after two refusals.</p><p>As they walked, Mao Fang praised the natural environment of Hama Gou endlessly and also asked Zhu Tianlei many questions about the basic situation of Hama Gou.</p><p>Upon reaching the village entrance, Zhu Tianlei immediately saw a small car parked not far from the passenger pickup point. A loved one of the provincial secretary traveling in merely a Passat; thinking back to what he had heard Jo Kang say outside his ward’s room that day, Zhu Tianlei felt slightly stirred.</p><p>"Aunt Mao, how is Secretary Qiao’s health?"</p><p>Only as they were parting did Zhu Tianlei bring up the question.</p><p>"Your medical skills are so good. Not only has your Uncle Qiao recovered, but after taking a few doses of medicine according to your prescription, he is now as energetic as a young man in his twenties and keeps telling me that when he has time, he wants to invite you over for a visit!"</p><p>Mao Fang's expression softened immediately upon mentioning Jiao Qiang. After exchanging a few more words, Mao Fang got into the car and left, watching as it sped away. Zhu Tianlei stood rooted to the spot for a long time. The winter wind blew against his face, carrying a hint of coldness, yet it felt like something was repeatedly pounding against his chest.</p><p>It was the eighth day of the first lunar month in an instant.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei woke up much earlier than usual that day, as he had an appointment with the wife of the provincial party secretary. He could not afford to keep her waiting. Before leaving, he went to the company. Mainly, he wanted to ask Mao Yu if there was anything he needed to convey. To his surprise, Mao Yu was not there.</p><p>Just as he was about to leave, he spotted a package on the bed with a note on top: Deliver this to Mao Fang. The handwriting was neat and elegant, unmistakably Mao Yu's. Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but smile at the corners of his mouth, picked up the package, and sped off in the car.</p><p>Since his jeep had fallen down a cliff and been completely destroyed, Zhu Tianlei had been driving the company's van for these past few days. The only advantage of the van was its spacious interior, but it also felt light and agile to him—definitely more so than his old jeep.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei arrived at the Municipal Public Security Bureau, it was before nine o'clock. He glanced around, seeing "No Parking" signs everywhere. Just as he pondered finding a small alleyway to park, a silver-gray Corolla pulled out from a nearby spot.</p><p>"That's a good idea!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei grinned and prepared to park in that spot.</p><p>Just as the rear of his van was about to touch the parking line, a red Porsche 911 streaked over. The tires spun, squealing as it claimed the very spot Zhu Tianlei had chosen.</p><p>Caught off guard by the sudden occurrence, Zhu Tianlei reacted too late. The rear end of the van bumped into the side door of the Porsche with a thud.</p><p>"Damn it, are you blind?"</p><p>When the Porsche door opened, a man in his mid-twenties stepped out, walked straight to the side door of the van, and pointed at Zhu Tianlei, shouting.</p>

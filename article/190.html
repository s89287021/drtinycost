						<p>Looking at the workers surrounding him, their faces were terrifyingly solemn, and the way they looked at Zhu Tianlei and Mao Yu, there was fear mixed with a hint of hatred.</p><p>Hatred?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was puzzled. They had met these people for the first time; even if Mao Yu had recorded them on her phone, there should not be any hatred in their eyes, right?</p><p>"One last question to you, will you hand over or not?"</p><p>The man looked at Zhu Tianlei and Mao Yu coldly. In fact, compared to those who attacked immediately, this man was already being relatively 'polite.'</p><p>"You are producing and selling counterfeit drugs, passing off them as Tiandelei Pharmaceutical products. This is the evidence!"</p><p>Mao Yu clenched her phone tighter and shouted fiercely at the man.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's head hurt. Mao Yu couldn't hold it in after all. The way people thought in China was different from that abroad; she actually believed that they would be afraid of her so-called 'evidence'?</p><p>This could only add fuel to the fire.</p><p>"If you don't want us to be polite, then get ready!" </p><p>Zhu Tianlei was about to speak when the man waved his hand at the workers. The rods in their hands were raised, and Zhu Tianlei had to protect Mao Yu and couldn't confront them head-on, so he hugged her tightly and, with a push of his feet, darted out of the circle like a swallow before the rods could come down.</p><p>For some reason, he didn't really want to fight these people.</p><p>"Tianlei, be careful!"</p><p>The moment they broke through the encirclement, Mao Yu screamed.</p><p>Without turning around, Zhu Tianlei reached behind with one hand and grabbed the wooden rod that was about to hit his head. With a forceful push of his palm, the rod, as thick as a child's arm, snapped in half with a snap.</p><p>Mao Yu patted her chest; she had been truly frightened earlier!</p><p>"Good boy, you've got some skills!" The middle-aged man praised him, but this praise did not mean a ceasefire; it meant the opponent was changing tactics. The middle-aged man's hands moved back and forth in the air twice, and the workers originally surrounding the two of them shifted their positions rapidly, the wooden sticks clattering on the ground. Formation? Zhu Tianlei's first thought was that these people were setting up a formation. But could it be possible? It was now the twenty-first century, not an ancient battlefield; could there still be people who would set up formations? "Heavenly Net and Earthly Web." The middle-aged man made another gesture, and these workers immediately raised their wooden sticks in unison. At first, Zhu Tianlei did not think much of it, but a few seconds later, he discovered that this seemingly insignificant action had quite a bit of skill involved. The previous attacks had been full of holes, which is why he could easily lead Mao Yu out from the crowd. But now, with wooden sticks forming a net above and people's bodies connecting to weave another net beneath, it truly was a Heavenly Net and Earthly Web. "Good strategy, but I'm afraid you'll be disappointed!" "Haha, this Heavenly Net and Earthly Web formation is something I, Yuan Zhen, spent two years researching before setting up. To be frank, even Li San Yan would not have been able to..." Standing outside the crowd, Yuan Zhen looked at Zhu Tianlei and said with certainty, but before he could finish, he saw Zhu Tianlei holding Mao Yu, like two butterflies flapping their wings together in an incredible way, flipping over the airtight 'heavenly net' and then lightly landing in front of Yuan Zhen. "You... you... how can you possibly..." Yuan Zhen felt his tongue twisting. Even those workers setting up the formation were all stunned. Just now, their hands holding the wooden sticks suddenly went numb, but it was only for an instant; this person—no, these two people—how did they end up outside the Heavenly Net and Earthly Web?</p><p>"Yuan Zhen, right? Your array formation is pretty amazing!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sincerely complimented him. If it weren't for him and instead was an ordinary person, this array would indeed be as its name suggests, a dead end with no place to go, impossible to escape.</p><p>Are you lying with your eyes open?</p><p>You came out without even blinking once, and you call yourself amazing? Are you kidding me?</p><p>Yuan Zhen inwardly cursed him a few times.</p><p>He genuinely admired Zhu Tianlei's skills, but protecting this place was his duty.</p><p>"Brother, I offended you!"</p><p>Said that, Yuan Zhen swung both arms like wings and pounced towards the feathers behind Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face darkened. He didn't mind sparring with him, but the direct attack on the feathers instantly erased Zhu Tianlei's respect for Yuan Zhen. The moment Yuan Zhen swooped in, Zhu Tianlei grabbed his wrist with one hand and squeezed hard, making half of Yuan Zhen's arm go limp.</p><p>"Those who bully the weak are the most despicable!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei hated bullying the weak the most, so he didn't plan on holding back.</p><p>"Hold it!"</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei increased the force in his hands, a voice suddenly came from behind.</p><p>"Boss!"</p><p>Yuan Zhen's face immediately became extremely respectful; this respect didn't stem from fear but from deep within his bones.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei slowly turned around and saw a pale-faced person leaning on crutches standing at the staircase entrance.</p><p>This man was tall but very frail, his coat hanging loosely on his body. His hair was short, barely more than a stubble above a bald head.</p><p>However, such a socialite did not affect this man's gentle demeanor. It seemed that regardless of his appearance, he would possess such a temperament.</p><p>"Little brother, this......"</p><p>The small man glanced at Zhu Tianlei and then at Yuan Zhen, his gaze towards Yuan Zhen showing a hint of fear and resentment.</p><p>As a salesman, wasn't it easy to attract a customer?</p><p>"Boss, they are recording with their phones. I......"</p><p>Yuan Zhen was not young, with a large frame and round waist, but in front of this frail man leaning on crutches, even his voice dropped several degrees.</p><p>"Are you from Tianlei Pharmaceuticals?"</p><p>The frail man's first words startled Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Could this man read minds?</p><p>"What?"</p><p>The small man spoke up first. His boss had an odd personality but was extremely capable, especially at judging people; he could always see through them. When he had applied for the job, he even thought his boss was a fortune-teller, mentioning that there was a copper coin mole on his buttocks.</p><p>So when the boss said this, it certainly wasn't without purpose.</p><p>Oh my God, if he really brought someone from Tianlei Pharmaceuticals in, wouldn't that be courting death!</p><p>"Boss has sharp eyes, well done!"</p><p>The small man's blood ran cold. He stood rooted to the spot, momentarily forgetting where he was.</p><p>Yuan Zhen was shocked as he stared at Zhu Tianlei. The man was actually from Tianlei Pharmaceuticals?</p><p>If one had to say who among these people was the calmest, it would be the lean man who just spoke.</p><p>"Praise indeed, I know you all will come, but I didn't expect it so soon. Xiao Hu, get everyone back to work. The two of you follow me to my office."</p><p>Xiao Hu, who regarded Zhu Tianlei as a godsend, stared blankly, still in shock and unable to react.</p><p>The lean man seemed not to notice and, after giving his instructions, turned around and left without greeting Zhu Tianlei again. Instead, he hobbled up the stairs on his crutches.</p>

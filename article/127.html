						<p>Zhang Yuntao's voice grew louder, and the force with which she tugged at her clothes intensified. Soon, her outer garment was torn open, revealing a pure white undershirt underneath.</p><p>"Aunty, stop pulling!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was rendered speechless by the sight before him, his throat dry and tongue tied. They were still on their way; the destination, Tianlei Pharmaceutical Company's staff dormitory, was only two or three miles away. If Zhang Yuntao continued to torment him, he might lose control and fight right there.</p><p>"Tianlei... I feel... so hot..."</p><p>Overwhelmed by discomfort, Zhang Yuntao's voice carried a hint of tears as she grabbed Zhu Tianlei's hand that was beside her face and pressed it to her bosom.</p><p>The softness and elasticity in his palm ignited an inferno within Zhu Tianlei's heart. He glanced around and noticed a field of melons nearby; at the far end, there was a watchmelon shed. Unfortunately, all the watermelons had been sold out, leaving the shed empty.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei embraced Zhang Yuntao, moving swiftly until he darted into the watchmelon shed in an instant.</p><p>Though the shed was uninhabited, the wooden bed inside still remained. Zhu Tianlei quickly undressed himself and used his clothes as padding on the bed before carefully placing Zhang Yuntao onto it.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao's unusual enthusiasm was palpable; she hugged Zhu Tianlei's neck while tearing open her floral jacket and then her undershirt too.</p><p>How could Zhu Tianlei withstand such temptation? He quickly took the initiative.</p><p>His large hands roamed over the scorching body, leaving their marks everywhere, like rivers flowing through valleys.</p><p>Erect sword pierced the quiver, nectar dripping from jade.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao, half-conscious and half-intoxicated, cooperated with Zhu Tianlei, bending her body into an elegant curve under the night sky.</p><p>"Ahh!"</p><p>A rough male voice and a delicate female voice echoed in unison, both letting out a sigh of pure pleasure.</p><p>"You this annoying little demon!"</p><p>After finishing, Zhu Tianlei carefully wiped away the marks on Zhang Yuntao's body. Looking at Zhang Yuntao fall asleep again, he lovingly said.</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao woke up, the events of last night replaying in her mind. At twenty-six years old, two rosy clouds bloomed on her face, her delicate appearance no different from that of a young maiden in her late teens, yet with an added touch of mature allure.</p><p>She sat up and found herself in a single-person dormitory.</p><p>Tianlei Pharmaceutical had recruited many employees from Yunhai City or other places. To ensure the employees could work and live comfortably, along with the factory, employee dormitories were built right from the start of construction.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao stretched out her hand to touch the quilt beneath her. It was warm and soft, emitting a faint scent of cotton.</p><p>Compared to her previous living conditions, this was a world apart.</p><p>"Yuntao, you're up?"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao turned around and saw Mao Yu standing at the door, her face turning red again.</p><p>Of course she knew Mao Yu, and she knew that without Mao Yu's strong support, Tianlei Pharmaceutical might not have been able to open its doors. Although she couldn't help Zhu Tianlei directly, she was deeply grateful for Mao Yu's assistance to him.</p><p>"Consultant Mao, you must be laughing at me; I got up too late!"</p><p>In Zhang Yuntao's heart, a rural woman should be diligent and rise early to take care of her family's daily life. But now that the sun was already high, she felt somewhat embarrassed.</p><p>"Oh my heavens, Sister Yuntao, what are you saying? It's only 7 AM! If there wasn't something important at work today, I would still be in bed dreaming!"</p><p>"You this annoying little demon!"</p><p>After finishing, Zhu Tianlei carefully wiped away the marks on Zhang Yuntao's body.

If there wasn't something important at work today, I would still be in bed dreaming!"</p><p>"You pesky little sprite!"</p><p>After finishing, Zhu Tianlei carefully wiped away the marks on Zhang Yuntao's body. Looking at her fall back asleep, he lovingly murmured.</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao woke up, the events of last night replaying vividly in her mind. At twenty-six, two rosy clouds had bloomed on her face, her delicate appearance no different from that of a young maiden in her late teens, yet with an added touch of mature allure.</p><p>She sat up and found herself in a single-person dormitory.</p><p>Tianlei Pharmaceutical had recruited many employees from Yunhai City or other places. To ensure their comfort, employee dormitories were built alongside the factory from the outset.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao stretched out her hand to touch the quilt beneath her. It was warm and soft, with a faint scent of cotton.</p><p>Compared to her previous living conditions, this was a world apart.</p><p>"Yuntao, you're awake?"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao turned around and saw Mao Yu standing at the door, her face turning red again.</p><p>She knew Mao Yu well and understood that without her strong support, Tianlei Pharmaceutical might not have been able to open its doors. Although she couldn't help Zhu Tianlei directly, she was deeply grateful for Mao Yu's assistance to him.</p><p>"Consultant Mao, you must be laughing at me; I got up too late!"</p><p>In Zhang Yuntao's heart, a rural woman should be diligent and rise early to take care of her family's daily life. But now that the sun was already high, she felt somewhat embarrassed.</p><p>"Oh my heavens, Sister Yuntao, what are you saying? It's only 7 AM! If there wasn't something important at work today, I would still be in bed dreaming!"</p><p>Mao Yu knew about Zhu Tianlei and Zhang Yuntao's relationship, and from a personal perspective, she had a favorable impression of this simple, honest woman with a touch of shyness. </p><p>It was like when Yang Xiaoxue first entered Hama Gou and saw the beautiful green mountains and clear waters there—Zhang Yuntao's simplicity and genuineness were very appealing to Mao Yu.</p><p>"Is there something?"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao casually replied, her first thought being that she might have delayed Zhu Tianlei's work.</p><p>"Yes, I came here to ask Sister Yuntao for help!"</p><p>"Ask me for help?"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao was taken aback. She was a rural woman who could barely read and write, only able to wash clothes, cook, raise chickens, and grow vegetables—what kind of help could she provide?</p><p>"Yes, our Tianlei Pharmaceutical Company is preparing to hold a business promotion conference today. We expect hundreds of people to visit the company for on-site inspections and investigations. The internal reception work will fall to you, Sister Yuntao!"</p><p>"What? Me do the reception?"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao thought she might have just woken up improperly and asked again.</p><p>"Yes, Sister Yuntao is meticulous in her work; no one could do this job better than her. That's what Tianlei meant too..."</p><p>Zhang Yuntao instinctively wanted to refuse, but seeing Mao Yu's smiling lips and the trust in her eyes, she couldn't bring herself to reject.</p><p>"Maybe I can really help Tianlei after all!"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao silently told herself.</p><p>At 8:30 AM, Zhang Yuntao changed into the company-uniformed work attire—a white blouse, a deep blue floral scarf around her neck, a dark blue miniskirt, black high heels, and her hair tied up with light makeup on her face.</p><p>Dress makes the man. When Zhu Tianlei saw Zhang Yuntao in this outfit, his heart skipped a beat.</p><p>"My wife is really beautiful!"</p><p>As he passed by Zhang Yuntao, Zhu Tianlei leaned close to her ear and whispered, not forgetting to lick her earlobe with the tip of his tongue.</p><p>In broad daylight, Zhang Yuntao's pretty face turned so red it looked like it could bleed.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had long since laughed and walked away, leaving behind the image of his dapper figure in a suit. Zhang Yuntao silently made up her mind that she would definitely do well today, no matter what.</p><p>At nine-thirty, the Tianlei Pharmaceutical Recruitment Conference officially began.</p><p>People filled every corner of the company, from inside to out. Various luxury cars lined up like an assembly line, stretching from the gates of Tianlei Pharmaceutical all the way to the village entrance.</p><p>In the deep mountains, the silent Toad Gulch, which had been dormant for hundreds of years, seemed to have suddenly been infused with a completely different kind of energy.</p><p>News media flocked in droves. Under the flashlights, Toad Gulch transformed from a paradise known only to a few into the most promising pharmaceutical star.</p><p>Hao Xinmei stood below the podium, looking at her man sitting up there like a god, his gaze steady and deep, each smile and frown mesmerizing to behold.</p><p>"Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests who have traveled far to be here, I am Zhu Tianlei from Tianlei Pharmaceutical. On behalf of all our employees, I would like to express our sincere gratitude and warm welcome for your presence..."</p>

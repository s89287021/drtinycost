						<p>Chiu Ran, you......"</p><p>Guan Yunli suddenly stood up in excitement, his face turning bright red. He pointed at Chiu Ran as if he wanted to say something, but halfway through, he fell backward. Zhu Tianlei, quick-witted and agile, caught Guan Yunli's arm.</p><p>"Oh no, it's a heart attack."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei muttered to himself under his breath.</p><p>Heart attacks are one of the deadliest diseases, especially acute ones. Even Zhu Tianlei was taken aback by this.</p><p>Among those present, apart from Chiu Ran and Zheng Chu, everyone else looked extremely distressed.</p><p>Without hesitation, Zhu Tianlei quickly took out a Zhenhuan Dan pill from his pocket. This was a new remedy he had developed during the New Year period, whose efficacy had not yet been verified. However, at this moment, it was the only medicine he had with him, so he could only use it as an emergency measure.</p><p>After putting the pill in Guan Yunli's mouth, Zhu Tianlei took out silver needles. The original Lingyi Seventeen Needles had undergone deep research and improvement, evolving into several extended needle techniques. At this moment, Zhu Tianlei was using the fourth technique of the Lingyi Seventeen Needles—Lingshen Xiuming Needles.</p><p>Chiu Ran looked at him coldly. He wished Guan Yunli would just die. If it weren't for Guan Yunli's interference when Chiu Ran was transferred, he might have been assigned to the City Bureau and wouldn't have been forcibly taken from his home on New Year's Day to be confined in a cell for over seven days.</p><p>Unnoticed by anyone, Zheng Chu, standing behind Zhang Gu, swiped several times on his phone.</p><p>"Tianlei, how is Guan's condition?"</p><p>After completing the acupuncture, Zhu Tianlei placed his hand on Guan Yunli's wrist, looking serious.</p><p>Guan Yunli's condition was far more complicated than he had imagined.</p><p>Not only did Guan Yunli have severe atherosclerosis, but he had also undergone heart bypass surgery. However, none of these were the most critical issues. The most critical issue was that Zhu Tianlei sensed a massive bleeding point within Guan Yunli's ribcage.</p><p>This bleeding point was not primary; rather, it was due to a foreign object inside his body. The object had been stuck on one side of an organ near his ribs all along, but when Guan Yunli became emotionally agitated, the increased blood flow pushed the object toward a blood vessel, causing it to rupture and leading to significant bleeding.</p><p>"Director Mao, the situation doesn't look too good......"</p><p>Máo Fāng's face instantly turned dark.</p><p>"Director Mao, I now need to provide further treatment for Secretary Guān and cannot be disturbed..."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Standard military responses. Zhang Gǔ looked at the two men with puzzlement.</p><p>Apart from being purer than the previous spirit qi, the most important feature of the Soul Returning Spirit Qi was its self-awareness. It could detect the disease site while providing precise treatment simultaneously.</p><p>Zhu Tiānlé had once searched online for similar methods and found them somewhat analogous to Western medicine's nanotherapy. However, his Soul Returning Spirit Qi was undoubtedly superior to any form of nanotherapy.</p><p>At this moment, there were tapping sounds of high heels outside the door.</p><p>"Sorry, you can't come in."</p><p>One of the two young men said.</p><p>"Who are you? Move aside for me!"</p><p>A woman's voice.</p><p>"Sorry, you really can't go in. Please cooperate with our work!"</p><p>It was still the young man's voice.</p><p>"You can't go in? Tell me, who are you guys to be so wild at the Public Security Bureau? Move aside or else I'll make sure you regret it!"</p><p>The woman had a strong presence and showed no sign of backing down despite being obstructed.</p><p>"Miss, don't hinder our work. Please leave!"</p><p>The young man was well-mannered and kept his tone calm throughout.</p><p>"Fine, if you won't move, then don't blame me for not showing mercy!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei heard the commotion outside and frowned slightly but did not turn around. The input of the Soul Returning Qi could not be interrupted, as doing so would not only undo all their efforts but also pose a risk of backfiring. Moreover, the two young men outside looked capable, and one woman should not pose much of a challenge.</p><p>However, before Zhu Tianlei's thoughts fully settled, he heard several dull thuds followed by the conference room door being pushed open from the outside.</p><p>A young girl wearing a pink cotton-padded skirt walked in. She was twenty-three or four years old, with an exceptionally beautiful appearance. In January, she had only a pair of stockings under her cotton skirt and was wearing black high heels.</p><p>The two young men at the door opening were on the ground, looking extremely pained.</p><p>"Miss Zheng... Where's my dad?"</p><p>The girl asked Director Zheng as soon as she entered the room.</p><p>Since Zhu Tianlei and Guan Yunli were in a corner of the conference room with most of their figures obscured by the podium, the girl did not see them.</p><p>"Xiao Jie, your father is inside. Depending on the situation, he might..."</p><p>Zhen Chu's face showed a hint of concern as he looked very genuine.</p><p>"Dad!"</p><p>The girl said this and was about to walk into the meeting room. Two young men guarding the door struggled to stand up, trying to pull the girl back. Unexpectedly, as soon as they approached the girl, she knocked them down with three punches and two kicks.</p><p>"Are you Governor Guan's daughter?"</p><p>Seeing the two people he had brought get flipped over directly by the other side, Mao Fang was extremely shocked. However, hearing the girl call Guan Yunli Dad, Mao Fang's expression softened.</p><p>"Who are you? Don't block me, I want to see my dad!"</p><p>The girl glanced at Mao Fang and was about to move past her to look at Guan Yunli, but to her surprise, instead of moving aside, Mao Fang stood directly in front of her.</p><p>"You can't go right now; your dad is undergoing treatment."</p><p>The girl looked at Mao Fang, slightly hesitating.</p><p>"Xiao Jie, the doctor hasn't arrived yet. How about I call Director Ke at the emergency center?"</p><p>Xiao Jie was originally hesitant, but after hearing Zhen Chu's words, her expression changed immediately.</p><p>If the doctor hasn't arrived yet, then who is treating my dad right now?</p><p>"Get out of the way!"</p><p>Without thinking, Xiao Jie pushed Mao Fang aside. Zhang Gu just wanted to reach out when his wife pulled his hand back.</p><p>"If you still want to climb higher, just stand there and don't move."</p>

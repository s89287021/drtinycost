						<p>"I will return to Europe a week later and hope to receive good news from Dr. Zhu before then."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt somewhat dazed.</p><p>It was because John mentioned in the end that his investment would be divided into three phases, with the first phase being twenty million yuan, and each subsequent phase increasing by fifty percent on top of the previous investment. By the end, Zhu Tianlei felt like his brain could no longer handle it.</p><p>At seven o'clock in the evening, in the conference room of Tianlei Pharmaceutical.</p><p>"Does he only want the overseas agency rights for the product?"</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei's account, Mao Yu also found it incredulous.</p><p>According to the foreigner's promise, the total amount of the three-phase investment was already close to one hundred million yuan.</p><p>It wasn't that Mao Yu lacked confidence in Tianlei Pharmaceutical, which he had built from scratch. Rather, the facts were there: no matter how promising Tianlei Pharmaceutical's future might be, it was still a newly established pharmaceutical company founded just two months ago in a remote mountain area.</p><p>An investment of one hundred million yuan was enough to shake up any major or medium-sized pharmaceutical company at will. Moreover, the other party did not even demand shares and only wanted the overseas agency rights for the product; it all sounded like something out of a fairy tale.</p><p>"Yes, he said that. I initially refused, but he asked me to come back and think about it again."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt that he had to listen to Mao Yu's opinion on this matter, which is why he rushed back to Hamagou overnight.</p><p>"Tianlei Pharmaceutical definitely needs to expand. We can't rely solely on the small market of Yunhai City. Adequate funding is our top priority for expanding our business scale, and entering the overseas market is inevitable..."</p><p>Mao Yu analyzed step by step according to his own thoughts.</p><p>"So your meaning is that you will accept John's investment?"</p><p>"I am also very hesitant. The terms offered by the other party are simply too tempting. I am worried about what their real intentions might be."</p><p>This was where Mao Yu truly struggled. Not every cake falling from the sky was so easy to eat.</p><p>"Did he say anything about his identity?"</p><p>Mao Yu thought for a moment, believing that understanding the other person's background would be helpful in making the right judgment.</p><p>"He didn't. However, he did give me a magazine, but it was all in English and I don't understand any of it......"</p><p>"What about the magazine?"</p><p>"It's in the car."</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei handed the magazine to Mao Yu and pointed out John's photo on it, Mao Yu abruptly stood up from his chair, pointing at John's photo in the magazine and staring intently at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Are you sure the person you saw was him?"</p><p>"Yes, that's him."</p><p>"Oh my God, Zhu Tianlei, what should I say to you? You're really, truly......"</p><p>Holding the magazine, Mao Yu circled around the conference table like a spinning top, leaving Zhu Tianlei thoroughly confused. He wondered if he had done or said anything wrong.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, do you know who he is?"</p><p>Facing Mao Yu's agitated and somewhat incoherent demeanor, Zhu Tianlei shook his head in confusion. Could it be the U.S. President?</p><p>No, that couldn't be right! He had seen the U.S. President on television!</p><p>"He is the ruler of the European Pharmaceutical Kingdom. His pharmaceutical giant, Qiangdi Pharmaceuticals, spans across all of Europe. John Nash himself has appeared several times on Forbes' list of billionaires, ranking among the top few. In a way, any drug exported to Europe must go through Qiangdi Pharmaceuticals. If Tienlei Pharmaceutical can align itself with this powerhouse, it would be...... amazing! Tienlei, I'm so excited!"</p><p>Mao Yu was indeed very excited. As far as Zhu Tianlei remembered, he had never seen Mao Yu so emotionally agitated.</p><p>He hadn't expected that the person he accidentally saved would turn out to be such a significant figure.</p><p>But compared to Mao Yu's excitement, Zhu Tianlei's expression remained calm.</p><p>A few minutes later, Mao Yu finally noticed something unusual about Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Tiandlei, you don't seem very happy?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded.</p><p>"Mao Yu, my thoughts are different from yours. I don't think as much or have as great ambitions as you do—certainly not right now. I just want to take things one step at a time. No matter how powerful Strong Deer Pharmaceutical is, it's not what I rely on. I hope you can understand."</p><p>Mao Yu was taken aback.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's idea was far out of her expectations. She had always known that Zhu Tianlei had an obsessive pursuit of wealth deep down, even if he did not necessarily seek material enjoyment himself.</p><p>But now, with such a good opportunity before him, why was he retreating?</p><p>After a long while,</p><p>"Tiandlei, you are the helmsman of Tiandlei Pharmaceutical. Whatever choice you make, I support you."</p><p>Although Mao Yu could not agree with Zhu Tianlei's decision, she trusted his character and thus chose to respect it.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei told John about his decision, disappointment was evident on John's face.</p><p>But as they say, a forced gourd is not sweet; John fully understood this principle.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, since you have made your decision, I will no longer insist. Take this with you as my gratitude for saving your life."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the item John handed over—a small box, unremarkable. Feeling somewhat guilty, he did not refuse it.</p><p>Because of John's special status, various county and city leaders came to visit the two men in turn. Each time, John would praise Zhu Tianlei, leading to his name echoing again throughout Yunhai.</p><p>And that afternoon, Zhu Tianlei saw for the first time Yang County Magistrate, who had repeatedly set him up and tried to drive him to death.</p><p>"Mr. Johnson, I am truly sorry for what happened to you in Daheshan County. As you can see, the medical facilities at the county hospital are quite limited. How about if I arrange for someone to take you to the city hospital for further treatment and recuperation?"</p><p>Yang County Magistrate was a short, plump middle-aged man with a bald head and fat cheeks, somewhat resembling Sun Jiang, who had a deep grudge against Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>At this moment, Yang County Magistrate sat beside Johnson's bed, his face full of flattery and sycophancy.</p><p>"Magistrate Yang, there is no need for such politeness. The medical conditions at the county hospital are quite good, and the doctors' skills have left me amazed. I do not wish to trouble you, Magistrate."</p><p>"Mr. Johnson is a guest in Yinhai City, and your safety and health are of utmost concern to all of us. I believe it would be best if you were transferred to the city hospital. The medical professionals at the county hospital have varying levels of competence, and some even practice medicine without proper certification. Despite numerous inspections by the county authorities, this issue persists. Therefore, Mr. Johnson..."</p><p>Standing in the corridor, Zhu Tianlei listened as Yang County Magistrate relentlessly tried to tarnish his reputation, going so far as to portray the hospitals within his jurisdiction as chaotic and incompetent before others.</p><p>"Unlicensed practitioners? Is what Magistrate Yang says true?"</p><p>"That is certainly the case. The county hospital recently hired a new outpatient specialist who was previously just a local hooligan, capable of only inserting needles. They hired him as an expert, and I am genuinely worried about Mr. Johnson. If he were to be treated by such a person and something went wrong, I fear I would be held responsible as the county magistrate!"</p>

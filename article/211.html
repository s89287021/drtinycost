						<p>The next morning, Xiao Gangbeng's father rushed back from his business trip. Seeing the couple hugging and crying, everyone felt heartbroken. </p><p>After all, it was just a child; the funeral ceremony was simple, with a small red lacquered wooden coffin and toys that Xiao Gangbeng used to play with brought overnight from Yunhai City buried on a small hill behind Tianlei Pharmaceutical. </p><p>Doctor Zhu Tianlei, Xiao Gangbeng's parents, and several employees of Tianlei Pharmaceutical witnessed a little life being covered by the earth, existing only in memory henceforth.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, thank you. The first time, you pulled Xiao Gangbeng back from the brink of death, and the second time, you let him die clearly and peacefully. This favor we will never forget."</p><p>Xiao Gangbeng's father, contrary to Doctor Zhu Tianlei's expectations, was not the unreliable man mentioned by Xiao Gangbeng but rather extremely steady and restrained, earning Doctor Zhu's respect.</p><p>"You and Big Sister can rest assured; I will take good care of Xiao Gangbeng."</p><p>After saying this, Doctor Zhu looked back at the newly erected tombstone on the hill. A cloud drifted across the sky, blocking the sun.</p><p>Five days later, it was Spring Festival.</p><p>Early in the morning, Old Man Zhuezi and Aunt Housuqin started bustling about.</p><p>In past years, their family celebrated simply during the Spring Festival, with a pair of couplets and a slaughtered chicken considered enough for the new year. This year was different; starting from the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, people kept visiting, bringing gifts that filled half the room.</p><p>Ma Lanlan, Yang Xiaoxue, Zhang Yuntao, and Hao Xinhui each prepared generous presents for the old couple, though under the guise of friends, it still made them suspicious.</p><p>"Mom, I want to invite Cloudtáo over for New Year's Eve dinner. You know her husband...."</p><p>While helping Aunt Housuqin pick garlic sprouts, Zhu Tianlei asked cautiously.</p><p>"Tianlei, widows often attract gossip. As a man, your reputation doesn't matter, but Cloudtáo is still a widow; you need to think about her. If rumors spread tomorrow, how will Cloudtáo find herself a partner?"</p><p>Aunt Housuqin's words made Zhu Tianlei feel odd. Though she seemed to be praising Zhang Yuntao, he couldn't quite figure out what was going on.</p><p>"Mom, aren't you the softest-hearted? Cloudtáo lives alone in the company dormitory. During the New Year, there's no one at the company. As the boss of the company, I am just being considerate towards my employee, right?"</p><p>Hou Suqin lifted her head and scrutinized her son carefully, but she didn't find anything suspicious in his eyes.</p><p>Maybe I was overthinking it?</p><p>"Alright, go call them. I'll add a few more dishes."</p><p>"My mom is so good!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei grabbed the partially picked garlic sprouts and threw them back into the basin, hugged Hou Suqin's neck, kissed her, and then jumped out of the door three feet high.</p><p>Hou Suqin watched her son's joyful figure, shaking her head with a smile.</p><p>At first, Zhang Yuntao didn't want to come. She was sensitive by nature, and being a widow made her reluctant to visit others during the New Year for fear of causing trouble. However, Zhu Tianlei's persistent pleading, calling her both "good daughter-in-law" and "good wife," eventually persuaded her to return home with him.</p><p>"Auntie, go rest in the house while I cook."</p><p>After brief pleasantries, Zhang Yuntao put on an apron and took the knife from Hou Suqin's hands.</p><p>"How could you do the work......"</p><p>"Auntie, just because I came for the New Year doesn't mean I consider myself an outsider. Do you hate me or are you afraid my cooking is bad?"</p><p>"Hush your mouth! Alright, alright, alright. You work hard then. If you need help, call me!"</p><p>"Okay!"</p><p>Seeing Hou Suqin lift the curtain and enter the inner room, Zhu Tianlei, who was sitting by the stove stoking the fire, jumped up abruptly and kissed Zhang Yuntao on the cheek so quickly that she almost screamed.</p><p>In the kitchen, Zhang Yuntao stir-fried vegetables while Zhu Tianlei tended to the fire. The atmosphere was warm and harmonious.</p><p>More than an hour later, twelve dishes were served on the table.</p><p>Hou Suqin lifted her head and scrutinized her son carefully, but she didn't find anything suspicious in his eyes.</p><p>Perhaps I was overthinking it?</p><p>"Alright, go call them. I'll add a few more dishes."</p><p>"My mom is so good!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei grabbed the partially picked garlic sprouts and tossed them back into the basin, hugged Hou Suqin's neck for a kiss, then jumped out of the door with boundless energy.</p><p>Hou Suqin watched her son’s joyful departure, shaking her head with a smile.</p><p>At first, Zhang Yuntao was reluctant to come. Sensitive by nature and burdened with the status of a widow, she didn't want to visit others during the New Year for fear of causing trouble. However, Zhu Tianlei's persistent pleading, calling her both "good daughter-in-law" and "good wife," eventually convinced her to return home with him.</p><p>"Auntie, go rest in the house while I cook."</p><p>After brief pleasantries, Zhang Yuntao put on an apron and took the knife from Hou Suqin’s hands.</p><p>"How could you do the work......"</p><p>"Auntie, just because I came for the New Year doesn’t mean I consider myself an outsider.

The atmosphere was warm and harmonious.</p><p>More than an hour later, twelve dishes were served on the table.</p><p>Hou Suqin raised her head and examined her son carefully, but she found nothing suspicious in his eyes.</p><p>Perhaps I am overthinking this?</p><p>"Alright, go fetch them. I'll add a few more dishes."</p><p>"My mom is so good!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei grabbed the half-picked garlic sprouts and tossed them back into the basin before hugging Hou Suqin’s neck for a kiss. He then jumped out of the door with unbridled energy.</p><p>Hou Suqin watched her son’s joyful departure, shaking her head with a smile.</p><p>At first, Zhang Yuntao was hesitant to come. Sensitive and burdened by her status as a widow, she didn't want to visit others during the New Year for fear of causing trouble.

The atmosphere was warm and harmonious.</p><p>More than an hour later, twelve dishes were served on the table.</p><p>"Uncle, Tianlei said you love to eat fish, so I specially made a braised carp for you. Please try it."</p><p>Zhu Quazi took a bite as he was called, and the outer layer was crispy while the inside was tender, with smooth meat. He couldn't help but take several more bites, praising it as he ate.</p><p>"Auntie, this is snowflake red bean paste. Tianlei said you like sweet flavors, so I didn't fry it too long. Please try it and see if it suits your taste?"</p><p>Hou Suqin picked up a bite of the snowflake red bean paste and put it in her mouth. It was firm yet chewy, soft and smooth, truly addictive.</p><p>A table full of dishes, two cold dishes, nine hot dishes, and one soup, all with perfect color, aroma, and flavor. The old couple enjoyed their meal immensely, and Zhu Quazi even had a few extra cups. Watching his parents' satisfied expressions, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but pinch Zhang Yuntao's hand under the table.</p><p>Such a wife is simply hard to find, right?</p><p>Because of this New Year's dinner, Hou Suqin and Zhu Quazi became closer to Zhang Yuntao, and Zhu Tianlei watched with joy in his heart.</p><p>In the middle of the night, fireworks filled the air.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei and Zhang Yuntao walked back to the company on a small path, looking at the sky lit up by fireworks as if it were daylight. They smiled at each other.</p><p>On New Year's Day, Zhu's front door was almost trampled down by people coming to pay their respects.</p><p>They heard so many blessings that the old couple felt dizzy, but they were genuinely happy in their hearts. Last year, and in previous years, his family's New Year had always been spent coldly and quietly. Indeed, moving up in life is the right choice.</p><p>On the third day of the New Year, Zhu's family welcomed an unexpected guest.</p><p>"Excuse me, is this the home of Zhu Tianlei?"</p><p>Zhu Quazi was lying on the bed playing poker to form a calendar for each month when he heard the noise at the door. Instinctively, he stood up.</p><p>Looking out from the bed, he vaguely saw a woman standing at the door.</p><p>Hou Suqin had gone visiting another family, and Zhu Tianlei was at work. Zhu Quazi was a very conservative person, thinking that there was only one man in the courtyard, and sharing a room with a woman might lead to gossip. So after some thought, he pretended not to hear and continued playing his poker on the bed.</p><p>"Uncle, Tianlei mentioned that you enjoy eating fish, so I specially prepared Braised Carp for you. Please give it a try."</p><p>Zhu Quazi responded to the call and took a bite, finding the outer layer crispy and the inner part tender with smooth meat. Unable to resist, he ate several more bites while praising the dish.</p><p>"Auntie, this is Snowflake Red Bean Paste. Tianlei said you prefer sweet flavors, so I didn't fry it too long. Please try it and see if it suits your taste?"</p><p>Hou Suqin picked up a piece of Snowflake Red Bean Paste and placed it in her mouth, finding it firm yet chewy, soft and smooth—a truly addictive treat.</p><p>The table was laden with dishes: two cold dishes, nine hot dishes, and one soup, all featuring perfect color, aroma, and flavor. The elderly couple enjoyed their meal immensely; Zhu Quazi even had an extra couple of drinks. Seeing his parents' satisfied expressions, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but pinch Zhang Yuntao's hand under the table.</p><p>Such a wife is hard to find, isn't she?</p><p>Thanks to this New Year's dinner, Hou Suqin and Zhu Quazi grew closer to Zhang Yuntao, which made Zhu Tianlei happy.</p><p>In the middle of the night, fireworks filled the air.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei and Zhang Yuntao walked back to the company on a small path, admiring the sky lit up by fireworks as if it were daylight.

Last year and in previous years, Zhu's family had always celebrated New Year quietly and alone.

After some consideration, he pretended not to hear and continued playing poker on his bed.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei went to the company, not for any other reason, but to spend some time with Zhang Yuntao. After a bout of lovemaking, he finally felt content and got up to go home.</p><p>"Director Mao?"</p><p>"Tianlei, you’re back! I’ve been waiting for you for two hours."</p><p>Mao Fang liked Zhu Tianlei very much. Due to her relationship with Mao Yu, her feelings towards Zhu Tianlei became even closer, and her words were less formal or distant than before.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was stunned. Two hours?</p><p>It had cooled down today, with the temperature at least minus seventeen or eighteen degrees Celsius. Mao Fang was wearing a knee-length coat and had been waiting for two hours—she must have caught a chill.</p><p>"Why didn’t Aunt Mao wait inside?"</p><p>"The house is empty, I didn’t want to go in on my own....."</p><p>Empty?</p><p>No way, his dad was clearly at home when he left!</p><p>But when Zhu Tianlei brought Mao Fang into the house, he saw Zhu Quezi sitting by the hearth with a pile of poker cards laid out.</p><p>"Dad, are you here?"</p><p>"T-hat… t-this…"</p>

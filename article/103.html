						<p>Zhu Tianlei did not return to the clinic but went straight home.</p><p>He found a ventilated and shady place to store the medicinal herbs, then sat under an apricot tree at the back of his house with his phone. During this season, the leaves of the apricot tree had already started turning yellow. Zhu Tianlei leaned against the trunk, and several yellow leaves drifted down, landing on his shoulder.</p><p>"Hello, is it Wu Hongqiang?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei dialed Wu Hongqiang's phone.</p><p>"It's me. You are......"</p><p>"I am Zhu Tianlei."</p><p>There was a pause on the other end, then the voice became solemn.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei explained his intentions, and Wu Hongqiang nodded repeatedly in agreement. After hanging up, Zhu Tianlei looked up at the sky through the sparse branches above him, feeling a hint of frustration.</p><p>In life, there really is nothing smooth sailing all the way. In the past, when he had nothing and lived a carefree life, though he was poor and powerless, his days were comfortable, and no one would deliberately target him.</p><p>However, as he gained medical skills and grew in fame, troubles followed closely behind. Those people were like maggots in a field, sticking to him and impossible to shake off, truly disgusting!</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was lost in thought, his phone rang.</p><p>Wu Hongqiang worked quickly and provided precise and accurate information.</p><p>"Thank you. Don't call me benefactor anymore; just call me Tianlei!"</p><p>After hanging up, Zhu Tianlei's anger rose and fell violently in his heart.</p><p>Sun Jianguo is really a small person, it seems he has set his sights on him, unwilling to let go until he eliminates him.</p><p>But now, even knowing it was Sun Jianguo, Zhu Tianlei could not retaliate because the other party had done nothing wrong and there was no evidence; he couldn't report them to any authority.</p><p>However, now that he knew about the faction secretly watching him, it was always better to be more cautious.</p><p>He glanced down at his watch and found it was already ten o'clock.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei quickly got up. Mao Yu had said yesterday that he would bring people directly to Lianggang for an on-site inspection. If he arrived late, who knew what kind of trouble Mao Yu might cause him!</p><p>When he reached Lianggang, Mao Yu was indeed leading a few people in measuring the land area. Seeing Zhu Tianlei approach, Mao Yu unexpectedly did not scowl but instead introduced several designers and engineers to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>As it approached noon, the measurement work was completed. Zhu Tianlei wanted to invite a few of them to have dinner at his place, but Mao Yu refused, claiming he needed to rush back to Yunhai City to accelerate drawing up the blueprints and contact suppliers for material transportation.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had grown accustomed to Mao Yu's no-nonsense style. After exchanging some pleasantries, he did not insist further.</p><p>From this point on, the construction of Tianlei Pharmaceutical officially began.</p><p>"Mao Consultant, you must be exhausted after working hard for so many days! Why don't you go home to rest!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Mao Yu's fair skin, which had been scorched red by the sun, feeling somewhat guilty. The man had not asked for a single cent from him and had taken care of everything from start to finish, even doing it all himself. As the nominal boss, Zhu Tianlei had become nothing more than a figurehead.</p><p>"Alright, you keep an eye on things. Auntie said she made sticky rice cakes for me, so I'll go give them a try!"</p><p>Uh!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback. It felt like Mao Yu had been deliberately waiting for him to speak up!</p><p>However, watching Mao Yu's departing figure, he also felt relieved.</p><p>The construction company that Mao Yu brought in was highly professional, evident from the initial preparations such as setting up trusses and arranging tents.</p><p>And all the design drawings were strictly reviewed, with dedicated supervisors overseeing the site, watching over it like hawks.</p><p>Two days passed, and construction officially began. When Zhu Tianlei arrived in the morning, he saw half-human-height cement brick walls standing under the sunlight.</p><p>At noon, Ma Lanlan brought two watermelons to Liang Gangzi. Since the start of construction, Zhu Tianlei had barely visited the clinic; when lovers are apart for a day, it feels like three autumns. So, Ma Lanlan decided to use the pretext of bringing watermelons to visit Zhu Tianlei herself.</p><p>Due to a previous misunderstanding, seeing Mao Yu left Ma Lanlan momentarily embarrassed. Just as Zhu Tianlei was about to speak and ease the tension, Mao Yu stood up first.</p><p>"Talk to each other, I'll go take a look around."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but inwardly marvel; he hadn't realized that Mao Yu actually had good situational awareness!</p><p>"Lanlan, miss me?"</p><p>The moment Mao Yu left, Zhu Tianlei pulled Ma Lanlan into his arms, his lips brushing against her delicate face. Electric currents seemed to run through Ma Lanlan's body.</p><p>"Stop it, there are people outside!"</p><p>"What are you afraid of? Am I hugging my own woman, do they have any say?"</p><p>With that said, Zhu Tianlei playfully covered Ma Lanlan's mouth and his hands began wandering all over her body without restraint.</p><p>Since he had developed a relationship with Zhang Yuntao, after experiencing the pleasure, Zhu Tianlei became even more eager for women. Knowing there were people outside, he couldn't resist reaching into Ma Lanlan's blouse.</p><p>"Lanlan, I miss you!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan's face turned bright red, so red that it seemed like blood was about to drip out.</p><p>"Tianlei, no, stop playing around... I have to go back!"</p><p>The sound of the mixer from outside entered their ears, causing Ma Lanlan's tense expression to pale. Although she also longed for Zhu Tianlei's further touch, reason ultimately prevailed.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei, despite his deep reluctance, knew that it was not the right time to do anything. However, before letting Ma Lanlan go, he couldn't resist grabbing a handful of snow from her mountain.</p><p>"These two watermelons, please cut them and share them with everyone! I'll be going back first!"</p><p>Mao Yu walked in, gave Zhu Tianlei a cold glance, and tossed something into his hands.</p><p>"Equipment purchase order?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at what he had been given and asked in surprise.</p><p>"Yes, this is the list of equipment I prepared based on the conventional pharmaceutical factory's requirements. Please take a look."</p><p>"Weren't we supposed to follow the manual pharmaceutical production route? Why are we now purchasing equipment?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned. He had already discussed with Mao Yu that during the company's initial stages, all medicines would be manually ground, mixed, and synthesized. Mao Yu had agreed to this plan, so why was she changing her mind now?</p><p>Mao Yu's short, delicate hair looked a bit disheveled from days of constant work without rest. The young woman, who was originally radiant and elegantly refined, now appeared somewhat haggard.</p>

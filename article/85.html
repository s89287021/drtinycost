						<p>Zhu Tianlei calmed himself and planned to coax Ma Lanlan later. For now, he had to handle the current situation with this great god first.</p><p>"Of course not, I'm not that bored. I came to deliver a business plan."</p><p>"Business plan?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei paused, wondering why it sounded so sophisticated, something he usually heard on TV rather than understood in detail.</p><p>"Yes, I've written all the processes and details of setting up the company in this business plan, but there are some things that need your approval and confirmation."</p><p>When it came to serious matters, Mao Yu's expression instantly turned serious, and Zhu Tianlei mirrored her demeanor.</p><p>"Consultant Mao, to be honest, I haven't had much education, nor have I ventured outside. Apart from knowing a bit of medicine and how to prepare pills, I'm virtually clueless about anything else. You can make the decisions; I trust you!"</p><p>Mao Yu looked at Zhu Tianlei, realizing that such sincere and down-to-earth people like him were rare, especially the last four words 'I trust you,' which warmed her heart and strengthened her confidence in her previous decision.</p><p>Having navigated the business world with a keen eye for human nature, she was certain that Zhu Tianlei was someone destined for great things.</p><p>"With me around, you can certainly relax, but as the legal representative of the company, you must be fully involved throughout. This way, after the company starts operating, you won't feel alienated or overwhelmed by sudden situations."</p><p>"Alright, go ahead and tell me what to do."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was straightforward; as they say, when using someone's talents, don't doubt them. Since he had chosen to trust Mao Yu, he would fully believe her and grant her authority.</p><p>"Haha, you really trust me a lot! Find a place, I'll explain the contents of the business plan in detail so we can finalize the details."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei thought for a moment and led Mao Yu home. Hou Suqin originally assumed that Mao Yu was there to see her son about his health, but upon hearing that she was an advisor for his company, her attitude became unusually warm, bringing out all the food and drinks in the house. She then sat across from them with eager anticipation.</p><p>Her eyes were like flames, filled with desire.</p><p>"Mom, go do something else!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei waited for a long time but saw no sign of his mother leaving, so he had to speak up.</p><p>"It's fine, Cousin. If you want to listen, go ahead and listen! Who knows, maybe I can even offer some suggestions!"</p><p>Mao Yu's attitude was unexpected by Zhu Tianlei. Since that was the case, he didn't have much to say anymore. On the other hand, Hou Suqin, upon hearing Mao Yu addressing her, looked at her with eyes full of adoration.</p><p>"You said the production workshop needs to cover at least 1,000 square meters? And it should be in a highland area?"</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei heard Mao Yu's requirements for the factory location, he immediately felt some difficulty.</p><p>Hagama Gou was located deep in the mountains, with limited farmland originally scattered around the foot of the mountain and Lianggangzi. His own land was divided into three different places.</p><p>More than 1,000 square meters meant almost two acres of land, which was completely beyond his expectations. What he had envisioned was something like Hu Jia's processing plant, building a plastic shed in their backyard.</p><p>Mao Yu spoke with eloquence, each word hitting Zhu Tianlei right where it hurt. Without much thought, he knew that Mao Yu had put effort into this business plan, but while he was moved, he also felt quite distressed.</p><p>Two acres of land were no small matter, and in Hagama Gou, the villagers' attachment to their land was extraordinary, otherwise there would not have been Li Xu's case.</p><p>"This is hardware. If we can't achieve this, all our design plans afterward will be useless."</p><p>Mao Yu immediately saw through Zhu Tianlei's current thoughts, and she had also investigated the situation in Hagama Gou, knowing the difficulty of acquiring land. However, she raised this requirement without settling for something less because Zhu Tianlei needed to have the ability to face and solve problems if he wanted to do business.</p><p>"Consultant Mao, can you give me two days?"</p><p>"Alright, then it's two days. The day after tomorrow at this time, I will come to hear your answer."</p><p>Mao Yu spoke and acted decisively, not wasting any time.</p><p>"Little Mao, have some food before you go!"</p><p>Seeing Mao Yu stand up, Hou Suqin hurriedly spoke. After listening for a long time, she didn’t understand much, but she realized one thing: if there was no land, her son’s company would be doomed!</p><p>"No Auntie, I’ll have many chances in the future. I still have other things to do, and next time I definitely will taste your cooking!"</p><p>Mao Yu had a reserved personality, but he treated Hou Suqin particularly well.</p><p>After Zhu Tianlei sent Mao Yu away, Hou Suqin’s face fell.</p><p>What should she do?</p><p>Two acres of land! That wasn’t a small amount. In the village and on Liang, there were almost no families that owned two whole acres.</p><p>Moreover, his family, the Zhu family, had neither money nor influence; how could they possibly get hold of two acres of land?</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei returned home, he saw his mother with her head bowed, mumbling to herself.</p><p>"Mom!"</p><p>"Lei'er, why don’t we trade our three acres of land under Liang for the land on top?"</p><p>While Zhu Tianlei was away, Hou Suqin had thought of many solutions and finally decided that this one might work.</p><p>"No way. Our whole family relies on those three acres of land under Liang throughout the year. If we give it up, what will we eat and drink? Besides, even if we agree to trade, the families on top of Liang may not agree."</p><p>The Zhu family’s relationships with other villagers were never particularly good, especially with the Old Sun family, who owned eight-tenths of an acre of land on Liang. Back then, Zhu Tazi (the cripple) had his leg injured by a stone while protecting one of the Sun men from misfortune. Afterward, not only did the Sun family remain silent and never visit Zhu Tazi, they also spread rumors that Zhu Tazi had deliberately tried to explode the stone above, thus crippling himself.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei was young, he couldn’t bear this injustice and frequently threw stones into Old Sun’s yard and even defecated there. The relationship between the two families could be described as extremely poor.</p><p>"No way, I’ll go with your dad to beg..."</p><p>Hou Suqin knew about this matter but she couldn’t just sit idly by while her son’s newly registered company was on the verge of failing. At worst, she would risk their dignity and ask for help.</p><p>"Mom, things aren't that bad yet. Don't get upset. I'll go take a walk first!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was also very irritated. This matter turned out to be much more complicated than he had imagined.</p><p>After leaving the courtyard, Zhu Tianlei looked around and finally headed up a small path to the west. The western path led to a meadow that used to be a swamp, but it had somehow dried up later on. However, few people visited it.</p><p>Standing beside a ditch next to the meadow, Zhu Tianlei irritably picked up a stone and was about to throw it away.</p><p>Suddenly, his gaze fell on a patch of wild grass not far away. The grass seemed to be trembling, and there were also giggling sounds coming from it.</p>

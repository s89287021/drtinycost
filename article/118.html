						<p>Hao Xinmei's body was as soft as a ball of cotton, yet it resembled a blooming rose, sweet and fragrant under the moonlight. Zhu Tianlei's breathing became increasingly rapid and heavy. "Ximei, Ximei, can... can I?" Zhu Tianlei buried his head in the lush grassland by Hao Xinmei, feeling almost consumed by the flames within him. He lifted his head and asked hoarsely. "Mm, Tianlei, I want it too." Hao Xinmei's words, filled with a hint of shy consent, caused Zhu Tianlei's flames to erupt from his body. He held onto his raised dragon head, pressing against the entrance of the small stream in the grassland, and his body suddenly sank. Hao Xinmei bit her teeth, leaving red marks on Zhu Tianlei's back. The stream mouth was narrow, but the dragon moved freely as if entering the heavens, wagging its tail at will. The stream tried to retain the dragon by continuously nurturing more water, further intensifying the dragon's fervor. Under the dark moonlight, a rose bloomed on the stone stairs. Though it would never be plucked in its lifetime and would eventually wither away due to wind, rain, and time, becoming nothingness, its magnificent and dazzling bloom was enough for Zhu Tianlei and Hao Xinmei to remember forever, making it eternal. The next morning, Zhu Tianlei woke up to the sound of barking. He looked at Hao Xinmei sleeping beside him, her black stockings scattered, a faint smile on her lips, as satisfaction and sweetness rippled through his heart like waves. He quietly got up, picked up Hua Rong who was jumping around on the ground calling out, and left the bedroom, closing the door softly behind him. Last night's entanglement had drained Hao Xinmei of energy. The young woman, experiencing her first intimate encounter, had been carried down the mountain by Zhu Tianlei and then half-asleep guided him back to her home. "You little brat, what are you yelling about? Can't you see my wife is sleeping? If you keep it up, I'll throw you out of the window!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei pointed at Hua Rong and said viciously, "Woof woof!"</p><p>Hua Rong glared with its tiny eyes, kicking its short legs. It didn't buy into it at all; it was already used to sleeping with Mommy. Why should this man take its place? Moreover, his gaze towards Mommy clearly wasn't right. Hua Rong sensed a threat and decided to show this man who's boss.</p><p>"Hehe, you little thing, are you feeling brave now? Do you think I'm just scaring you? Fine, fine, fine, let me show you today if I dare or not!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei grabbed the fur around Hua Rong's neck and instantly stood by the window, then opened it.</p><p>"Woof woof!"</p><p>Hua Rong's eyes were filled with fear. Help! They're going to kill the dog!</p><p>"Tianlei, what are you doing?"</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was gloating inwardly, he heard a voice from behind, making his spine tingle. He immediately hugged Hua Rong tightly.</p><p>"Hehe, Xiao Mei, I thought the air was nice, so I brought Hua Rong to breathe some fresh air, right, little thing!"</p><p>After saying that, he playfully pinched Hua Rong's belly lightly.</p><p>Hua Rong looked at its Mommy, feeling incredibly wronged. But it really feared Zhu Tianlei throwing it down, so it could only whimper a couple of times.</p><p>Watching Zhu Tianlei's actions, Hao Xinmei found herself laughing inwardly.</p><p>She had already woken up when Zhu Tianlei got out of bed and heard what he said to Hua Rong. Thinking about how she lived alone for so many years and now suddenly had someone by her side, someone who cared about her and loved her, even calling her wife, made her feel as happy as if she was floating in honey.</p><p>The entire morning, Zhu Tianlei and Hao Xinmei were inseparable, except for breakfast, which they ate in bed.</p><p>Hua Rong was locked outside the bedroom, pitifully lying in its small nest, cursing Zhu Tianlei countless times with dog barks.</p><p>In the bedroom, Hao Xinmei's fair-skinned figure lay exposed. She had just pulled the blanket over herself when Zhu Tianlei quickly yanked it off and pounced on her like a band-aid.</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei was sated and ready to return to Hamagou, Hao Xinmei glared at him angrily. Today, Hao Xinmei was more alluring than beautiful, resembling a peach that had just been nourished by dew.</p><p>"Little Mei, why don't you come back with me to Hamagou!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was already dressed, but he couldn't bear to leave Hao Xinmei, who was tightly wrapped in a blanket.</p><p>"Hao Xinmei, get lost! Don't ever come back!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei, feeling both ashamed and angry, pushed Zhu Tianlei out the door and slammed it shut with a bang.</p><p>Above the suburb, peach blossoms bloomed in abundance. Her legs were so weak she could barely stand, but a smile slowly spread across her lips.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was elated, not just because of his physical satisfaction but also because he knew Hao Xinmei had completely submitted to him.</p><p>As for Tang Qingshan and his brothers Tang Huangshan and Tang Huashan, who were being held by Yao Gang, they had been transferred to custody.</p><p>Zuhe specially informed Zhu Tianlei that he had sent a message to their Black Eagle Gang associates in prison, assuring that the Tang brothers' stay would be 'very comfortable.'</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei wasn't someone who enjoyed stirring trouble, it didn't mean others could trample over him without consequences—especially when it came to his family and loved ones.</p><p>As soon as he returned to the village, Mao Yu called him.</p><p>"Tianlei, come to the factory quickly."</p><p>"Another incident?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei now reacts on instinct because the recent days have been too tumultuous.</p><p>"Oh no, jinx, can't you say something positive? Hurry up, I'm waiting for you!"</p><p>Mao Yu hung up the phone hastily.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was puzzled; it wasn't an emergency, so what was going on?</p><p>When Zhu Tianlei parked his car and started walking towards the bridge, he kept muttering to himself.</p><p>"Tianlei, close your eyes, quick!"</p><p>Before reaching the bridge, Mao Yu ran over from a small path nearby and immediately told Zhu Tianlei to close his eyes.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled helplessly and complied, closing his eyes.</p><p>Mao Yu's little hand pushed his shoulder. It wasn't necessary since Zhu Tianlei could walk up the road with his eyes closed, but he didn't want to spoil Mao Yu's fun.</p><p>"It's okay now, Tianlei, open your eyes!"</p><p>Mao Yu's voice was crisp, sweet, and excited like that of a child.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei slowly opened his eyes.</p><p>Before him, a three-story factory building gleamed brightly. White marble reflected glaring light in the sunlight.</p><p>In front of the building, there was a stone platform with three flagpoles placed on top.</p>

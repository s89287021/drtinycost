						<p>Screams filled the air continuously.</p><p>Seeing Tang Huangshan's miserable state, Yao Jianxiong felt no sympathy; instead, he found it exhilarating and satisfying.</p><p>"Ah, you...... I said, I said, give me an antidote right away!"</p><p>Tang Huangshan could not hold on for more than a minute and began to cry and beg Zhu Tianlei for the antidote.</p><p>"I've already told you, I only give you one chance."</p><p>"I know I was wrong, I said, this time I promise, anything you ask, okay? Please give me the antidote, I can't take it anymore!"</p><p>Tang Huangshan regretted it deeply. Starting a pharmaceutical factory had not been his idea; it was supposed to be a good opportunity to gain merit and make money, but now he was facing losing his life.</p><p>"I don't want to hear any more of this!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's gaze was cold, making Tang Huangshan feel even colder as he endured both physical and mental torment, truly worse than death.</p><p>"It...... it's because my brother took some money from someone, so he wanted to start a pharmaceutical factory in Toad Ditch....."</p><p>As expected.</p><p>The coldness in Zhu Tianlei's eyes flashed.</p><p>"Who is this person?"</p><p>"I...... I don't know. That person contacted my brother directly; I never saw them and have no idea who they are...... I'm telling the truth, if any of this is a lie, may heaven strike me with lightning......"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei turned around and left after saying that sentence.</p><p>"Hey hey hey!"</p><p>Tang Huangshan was so furious he nearly spat blood. The other party didn’t seem to have any intention of giving him the antidote; a few minutes had already felt unbearable, let alone an hour… He would die!</p><p>"Tianlei, do you think there's something suspicious about this matter?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei come out from the eastern room, Yao Gang hurriedly went up to him and asked after hearing Zhu Tianlei’s brief explanation.</p><p>"Villager Director, I came to your place yesterday to discuss setting up a pharmaceutical factory."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn’t answer Yao Gang’s question but simply stated his purpose for coming yesterday. Yao Gang was smart enough to figure out the crux of the problem with just a moment's thought.</p><p>"Do you think this is directed at you?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained silent. Who was this behind-the-scenes person? Not only did they know about Yao Gang and the Tang family’s relationship but also knew in advance about his plan to set up a pharmaceutical factory.</p><p>Apart from Zhao Zhiguo, he didn’t think he had such an intense conflict with anyone else. But he was well aware of Zhao Zhiguo’s capabilities; pulling off minor underhanded tricks to annoy people was no problem for him, but something on this scale was beyond his reach.</p><p>"Tianlei, are you really going to set up a pharmaceutical factory?"</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei’s intention to establish a pharmaceutical factory, Yao Gang was excited. This feeling was entirely different from when he heard that his uncle wanted to do the same.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was a treasure of Huanggou Village. If he were to set up a pharmaceutical factory in Huanggou, it would undoubtedly boost the village’s economy and solve employment issues for many villagers. It would be a great deed benefiting both the village and its people, bringing significant benefits to him as the Villager Director.</p><p>"Yes, I’ve already obtained the necessary permits, but I need two mu of land on the ridge for the factory building. That's why I came to ask you, Villager Director, if you could help me think of a solution."</p><p>Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei’s words, Yao Gang’s excitement was immediately doused like a fire that had been splashed with water, and it flickered out.</p><p>There were indeed about three or four mu of land on the ridge, but it was scattered among different households. One family had an acre, another had half an acre, with the largest belonging to Sun Dafu’s family at eight tenths of an acre. However, Sun Dafu was a domineering household in the village, and even as the Villager Director, Yao Gang dared not provoke him.</p><p>And the people of Hamagou Village, because they originally had very little arable land, were particularly attached to their plots. This was also why Shengshi Group, despite offering a huge sum of money, could not purchase any land.</p><p>The best and most fertile land in Hamagou Village was the two or three mu on top of the ridge. Zhu Tianlei’s desire for this land was as difficult as ascending to heaven.</p><p>Although Liu Chunmei did not understand the village dynamics as well as Yao Gang, she knew that this matter would be challenging. This could be inferred from her husband's expression.</p><p>"Child's father, we do have three mu of land on top of the ridge, right? Use it for Lei's factory!"</p><p>Liu Chunmei could think of no other solution but knew to use whatever resources they had.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not expect Liu Chunmei to say this and felt a twinge of emotion rise in his heart.</p><p>"Our land will definitely be at your disposal, Tianlei. You can rest assured. Uncle can't help you with anything else, but I'll take care of securing the land for your factory."</p><p>Yao Gang paused for a moment before suddenly slapping his thigh and making a solemn promise to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was surprised by Yao Gang's attitude. Initially, he had only come to the village chief’s house on a whim with no real hope, but things turned out better than expected.</p><p>"Then it will be up to the village chief to handle. By the way, I have already secured Sun Dafu's eight mu of land. The village chief doesn't need to visit the Sun family anymore."</p><p>Watching Zhu Tianlei leave, Yao Gang was momentarily taken aback.</p><p>Had Zhu Tianlei really managed to convince Sun Dafu?</p><p>How did he do it?</p><p>Yao Gang was curious, but Sun Dafu had been the toughest nut to crack. He had not even considered approaching him before, so this development made Yao Gang feel a lot lighter.</p><p>With Yao Gang's promise, Zhu Tianlei breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>However, Tang Huangshan’s words still echoed in his mind: who was behind it all? Unless they uncovered the black hands, the pharmaceutical factory would never be able to run peacefully even if it were established.</p><p>Because he had something on his mind and was woken up early by Yao Jianxiong, Zhu Tianlei was exceptionally tired. After some thought, he sent a WeChat message to Ma Lanlan, telling her that he would not go to the clinic in the morning.</p><p>However, even after lying down on the bed, he did not receive a reply from Ma Lanlan. He knew in his heart that this girl was angry again and sighed helplessly. After flipping over twice, he fell asleep.</p><p>He did not expect that taking a nap would result in nightmares. When Zhu Tianlei woke up drenched in cold sweat, he still had the image of himself stepping off a cliff in his mind.</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>Zhu Tianlei cursed under his breath, got up, and washed his face with cold water. Before he could even dry his face, he heard loud noises outside the courtyard.</p><p>He slightly irritatedly lifted the bamboo curtain to see a large group of people walking into the yard one after another.</p><p>Among them was someone lying on a stretcher. Zhu Tianlei’s vision was extraordinary; despite the distance, he clearly saw who was on the stretcher.</p><p>“Zhu, get out here!”</p><p>The leader was a woman in her fifties, dressed in gold and silver jewelry, with painted eyebrows and coiffed hair. Apart from an unattractive face, everything else about her looked decent.</p><p>Zhu Tazi had gone to spray pesticide on corn, leaving only Zhu Tianlei and Hou Suqin at home. Hearing the woman’s shouts, Hou Suqin ran out of the house barefoot.</p><p>“Mom, go back home; there’s nothing wrong!”</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei went outside and then quietly closed the door to the hall, his actions inexplicably filled with a certain horror.</p>

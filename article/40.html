						<p>Tian Lei, I am older than you and have even been married. I do not deserve you...” Zhang Yuntao's heart was filled with bitterness. She had longed to be pampered and dominated by Zhu Tianlei, but she was no longer a flawless person. She was a woman who had been married before, and she could not sully Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Looking at the charming woman in front of her, tears welled up in his eyes, as if he were a wounded little beast. Zhu Tianlei felt deep pain for her.</p><p>He held Zhang Yuntao close again, but this time without any sexual desire. He only wanted to make Zhang Yuntao understand that in his heart, she was just a woman, one whom he wanted to love and protect.</p><p>After a long while, the two of them finally parted.</p><p>"Yuntao, you are no less than any other woman. On the contrary, you are strong, brave, and independent. You are more outstanding than many women. Don't say such things about yourself anymore, did you hear me?"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao's face turned rosy red as she shyly nodded her head.</p><p>No matter what happened between her and Zhu Tianlei in the future, she would always remember this moment, these words of Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Oh right, Tian Lei, why did you come up to the mountain?"</p><p>After their emotions had stabilized somewhat, Zhang Yuntao remembered to ask Zhu Tianlei about this matter.</p><p>"I came up here to look for herbs. I didn't find any herbs, but instead found a beauty!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei laughed mischievously, and Zhang Yuntao did not get angry.</p><p>"It's still early in the day. Let's go over there to take a look. I heard that Xiaohexi has many herbs, but I dare not go there alone!"</p><p>After Zhu Tianlei's heartfelt words just now, Zhang Yuntao's mindset had changed significantly. She boldly suggested to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Having a beauty by my side is what I have always wanted!"</p><p>"Flatterer!"</p><p>Tian Lei, despite being older than you and having been married before, do not think you are unworthy of me...” Zhang Yuntao’s heart was filled with bitterness. She had longed to be pampered and dominated by Zhu Tianlei, but she was no longer a flawless person. She was a woman who had been married, and she could not defile Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Looking at the alluring woman in front of him, tears welled up in Zhu Tianlei’s eyes, as if he were a wounded little beast. He felt deep pain for her.</p><p>He held Zhang Yuntao close again, but this time without any sexual desire. He only wanted to make Zhang Yuntao understand that in his heart, she was just a woman, one whom he wanted to love and protect.</p><p>After a long while, the two of them finally parted.</p><p>"Yuntao, you are no less than any other woman.

Zhang Yuntao's heart was heavy with bitterness. She had yearned to be pampered and dominated by Zhu Tianlei, but she was no longer a flawless person. She was a woman who had been married before, and she could not tarnish Zhu Tianlei’s purity.</p><p>Looking at the bewitchingly beautiful woman in front of him, tears welled up in Zhu Tianlei's eyes, as if he were a wounded little beast. He felt deep sorrow for her.</p><p>He held Zhang Yuntao close once more, but this time without any hint of desire. His only wish was to make her understand that, in his heart, she was just a woman—a woman whom he wanted to love and protect.</p><p>After a long while, the two finally parted.</p><p>"Yuntao, you are no less than any other woman. On the contrary, you are strong, brave, and independent. You are more remarkable than many women. Don’t say such things about yourself anymore, did you hear me?"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao’s face turned rosy red as she shyly nodded her head.</p><p>No matter what happened between her and Zhu Tianlei in the future, she would always remember this moment, these words of Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Oh right, Tian Lei, why did you come up to the mountain?"</p><p>After their emotions had stabilized somewhat, Zhang Yuntao remembered to ask Zhu Tianlei about this matter.</p><p>"I came up here to look for herbs.

Let’s go over there to take a look. I heard that Xiaohexi has many herbs, but I dare not go there alone!"</p><p>After Zhu Tianlei’s heartfelt words just now, Zhang Yuntao’s mindset had changed significantly. She boldly suggested to him.</p><p>"Having a beauty by my side is what I have always wanted!"</p><p>"Flatterer!"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao pouted playfully, half in a teasing manner and half out of shyness, turning her body away.</p><p>The Xiaohei Stream mentioned by Zhang Yuntao is a tributary of the Daling River. It flows through Heihulin and forms a small stream in a ravine below Hulu Cave. Because the rocks in the ravine are deep brown or black, the stream looks black, hence its name, Xiaohei Stream.</p><p>Xiaohei Stream is not far from where they were standing. Along the way, Zhu Tianlei held Zhang Yuntao's hand, and the two of them seemed like newly-in-love lovers, chatting and laughing, exchanging glances filled with affection.</p><p>Soon, they heard a gurgling sound of running water near their ears.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>"What's wrong, Tianlei?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei raise his eyebrows in surprise, Zhang Yuntao was also puzzled.</p><p>"The water in Xiaohei Stream is always calm; it definitely wouldn't make such a loud noise!"</p><p>"Could it be because of the rain two days ago?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded. What Zhang Yuntao said made some sense. As they were pondering this, they had already reached the side of Xiaohei Stream, only to find their path blocked by a huge rock that had fallen from the mountain.</p><p>"Come on, I'll carry you over!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei beckoned with his finger, and Zhang Yuntao didn't refuse, throwing herself into Zhu Tianlei's arms. Zhu Tianlei bent down, kissed her lips lightly, then leaped forward to land beside Xiaohei Stream.</p><p>At this moment, the water level of Xiaohei Stream had risen significantly. What was originally a stream about one meter and forty-five centimeters wide now appeared to be more than three meters wide. Water flowed from the rocks, splashing up in all directions like a miniature waterfall.</p><p>No wonder the sound of running water was so loud.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei walked towards the water's edge and reached into it, feeling that the stream water was icy cold.</p><p>"Tianlei, look quick!"</p><p>bugs!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei suddenly remembered the strands of pale blood that Qu Chuan had spat out, which were like thin white threads.</p><p>Yes, the water consumed by Hama Gou village and several surrounding villages came from the Daling River. In particular, for convenience in drinking water, many households in Hama Gou drew their water directly from the Xiaohei Stream.</p><p>The moment Zhu Tianlei figured this out, he felt a sudden clarity!</p><p>Now, he could be certain that these white bugs were the cause of the villagers' strange illnesses.</p><p>However, finding the cause was one thing; how to treat it remained unclear.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao stood to the side, seeing Zhu Tianlei frown and look deep in thought, so she knew not to disturb him. She quietly walked over to a nearby patch of grass, hoping to find some medicinal herbs.</p><p>"Tianlei, come quickly!"</p><p>While Zhu Tianlei was lost in his thoughts, he rushed over upon hearing Zhang Yuntao's call.</p><p>"Tianlei, look, these seem to be all medicinal herbs!"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao pointed at the endless sea of green before them.</p><p>At first, Zhu Tianlei was not impressed. But when he examined it closely, he opened his mouth in shock.</p><p>"Yuntao, you really are my lucky star!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei excitedly picked up Zhang Yuntao and spun him around several times on the spot, making Zhang Yuntao dizzy.</p><p>"Yuntao, these are all herbs, and many of them are very rare. With these, there is hope for curing the villagers' illnesses!"</p>

						<p>The ICU ward was located on the top floor of the hospital building. Zhu Tianlei was immediately stopped by a nurse at the reception desk as soon as he entered.</p><p>"This is the ICU ward; relatives are not allowed to visit casually, I'm sorry!"</p><p>Although the young nurse was not old, she spoke with authority. Most importantly, despite her refusal and obstruction, she did not make anyone feel offended.</p><p>"Sister, this is my brother who just rushed back from out of town. Grandpa has always been most concerned about him. We don't even know how long Grandpa will live. I don't want Grandpa to have any regrets. Sister, please make an exception!"</p><p>Ge Yang looked at the nurse silently and began to lie convincingly.</p><p>"Ge Yang, I understand your feelings, but this is hospital policy. I'm just an intern, and if I violate the rules, I won't be able to complete my internship period. Please don't put me in a difficult position!"</p><p>The nurse also seemed conflicted, but emotions were emotions and duties were duties.</p><p>"Sister, please, can you make an exception? This is the VIP section, with only Grandpa as the patient. If you keep it a secret, no one will find out. Sister, please make an exception!"</p><p>Ge Yang did not give up and continued to plead.</p><p>The nurse looked at Ge Yang, her gaze showing some hesitation.</p><p>"I'll be back soon; I promise I won't cause you any trouble!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said this, unsure if these words reassured the nurse. The nurse glanced around nervously before nodding to Ge Yang and Zhu Tianlei in a low voice.</p><p>"You two have to hurry up; otherwise, I'm in trouble!"</p><p>"Okay, thank you, Sister!"</p><p>Ge Yang and Zhu Tianlei quickly changed into sterile gowns and entered the ICU ward under the nurse's anxious gaze.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had previously been to the intensive care unit at the county hospital and the emergency room at the city emergency center, but neither could be compared to the ICU ward he was now in.</p><p>In a spacious ward of over one hundred square meters, an automatic hospital bed was positioned centrally. At the head of the bed, screens of various instruments flickered with changing values, and beeping alarm sounds never ceased.</p><p>The floor was covered with ultra-quiet dust-free carpets, the walls were lined with soundproof panels, and thick blackout curtains isolated the ward from the outside world.</p><p>On the bed lay an elderly man in his fifties, emaciated.</p><p>"Brother Zhu, my grandfather has been unconscious for two days now!"</p><p>It seemed that Ge Yang had a deep bond with his grandfather; upon seeing his grandfather, Ge Yang's emotions became agitated.</p><p>"Is your grandfather's injury from external trauma?"</p><p>Only after approaching did Zhu Tianlei notice the bandages wrapped around the elderly man’s abdomen under the blanket.</p><p>"Yes, he was stabbed by a thin blade."</p><p>At the thought of that scene, Ge Yang wished to tear the perpetrator limb from limb.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Ge's grandfather and must admit that for external injuries, he did not have much confidence. However, with no other option, he had to do his best.</p><p>"Ge Yang, go get a cup of water!"</p><p>Hearing this, Ge Yang left to fetch some water while Zhu Tianlei placed his hand on the grandfather’s wrist.</p><p>The pulse was akin to taut strings, straight and long, rising and falling abruptly—a clear sign of grave danger.</p><p>However, what somewhat relieved Zhu Tianlei was that amidst the ominous pulse, there was a subtle hint of new life—indicating that Ge's grandfather possessed strong willpower and an intense desire to live. If not for this, he might not have survived until Zhu arrived.</p><p>Though they had not met before, Zhu Tianlei still held some admiration for Ge's grandfather.</p><p>He first used spiritual energy to protect the grandfather’s heart and spleen, then inserted needles around the wound edges using a technique called ‘Sloping Sun Needle Method’ in Spirit Medicine. This method was primarily used to regulate qi flow and stop bleeding.</p><p>"Big Brother Zhu, water is here!"</p><p>"Feed this pill to your grandfather."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took a newly compounded 'Xuanqingdan' from his medicine bottle and handed it to Ge Yang.</p><p>Ge Yang trusted Zhu Tianlei implicitly and without hesitation split the pill in half, pried open Mr. Gao's mouth, and stuffed the pill inside.</p><p>This action calmed much of Zhu Tianlei's anger toward them.</p><p>Withdrawing his gaze, Zhu Tianlei did not waste time. While administering the needles, he also channeled spiritual energy into Mr. Gao. He could not guarantee with certainty that Mr. Gao would recover from danger, but at least he could wake him up. Even if Mr. Gao couldn't say a few parting words to Ge Yang, Zhu Tianlei would feel he had come for nothing.</p><p>At this moment, a commotion suddenly erupted outside the ward.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was already experienced and knew without a doubt that someone had discovered his entry into the ICU with Ge Yang.</p><p>However, it happened so quickly—within just ten minutes—that the revelation seemed too swift?</p><p>"How do you work? Is the ICU open to anyone? If something goes wrong with the patient, can you, a little intern, take responsibility?"</p><p>"Wuuu... Director, I know I made a mistake, wuuu..."</p><p>"Hmph. Knowing your mistake is useless. If the patient dies, you won't escape responsibility."</p><p>The nurse's sobs came through the door, faint but clearly audible to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Following this, the ICU ward door was pushed open, and a middle-aged man with a pasty face and tall stature appeared in front of Zhu Tianlei. When his gaze fell on the silver needles inserted into Mr. Gao's body, he immediately frowned.</p><p>"Who are you? How dare you act so boldly? Security, take this person away!"</p><p>"This is the doctor I hired. Your hospital couldn't cure my grandfather, so why don't you allow me to bring in someone else?"</p><p>Before Zhu Tianlei could speak, Ge Yang stood up first. The seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy showed no sign of panic or fear in front of the stern director.</p><p>"Since he was brought to our hospital, he must accept the treatment plan provided by the hospital. Even the patient's family has no right to interfere. Security, arrest him!"</p><p>This time, the middle-aged man changed his word from "maneuver" to "arrest."</p><p>"Is that so? Let's see if you have the ability to do that!"</p><p>Ge Yang took out his phone and called someone, though it was unclear who. Within a minute, more than ten young men with serious expressions appeared at the door of the ward.</p><p>"Young Master!"</p><p>The leader of those men was precisely the one Zhu Tianlei had seen before—the man driving the jeep.</p><p>"Hold the door shut! Whoever comes in, hit them for me!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei curled his lips. He hadn't expected this boy to be so audacious. Well, it was good; he wouldn't have to worry about being distracted.</p><p>"You... all of you are too bold, going against reason. Security, what are you standing there for? Move!"</p><p>The security personnel outside heard the order and did not dare to delay. However, as they approached the door, they were all knocked flying by a palm strike from the young man who had been standing guard.</p><p>The other security officers rushed in, but it was evident that these young men's skills far exceeded those of the security personnel. It was like using a cannon to kill a fly.</p><p>"Rebellion! Rebellion!"</p>

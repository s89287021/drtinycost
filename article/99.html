						<p>Du Xingfen widened her eyes, waiting for Zhu Tianlei's next words.</p><p>"Hey Tianlei, Xingfen, why didn't you let me in? What was that at the door?"</p><p>Sun Dafu suddenly came out of the house, wearing a smirking face. Zhu Tianlei tugged at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>"So Uncle Dafu is here!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words made Sun Dafu and his wife's faces turn slightly awkward.</p><p>"You lazybones, not making a sound in the house; I thought you had gone out. Tianlei, take a look at this......"</p><p>Du Xingfen reacted quickly. Zhu Tianlei didn't want to dwell on the matter, as everyone knew what really happened.</p><p>"It's fine, it's fine. Uncle Dafu, I won't go in. Let's just talk here for a bit!"</p><p>"Alright, Xingfen, you get back to work. I'll have a word with my nephew."</p><p>Du Xingfen had her doubts but had originally thought about staying to listen. However, since her husband spoke up, she didn't want to insist on not going in and reluctantly walked into the courtyard, swaying her plump buttocks.</p><p>After taking a glance, Sun Dafu hurriedly closed the main door and led Zhu Tianlei all the way to the dry toilet outside the yard before stopping.</p><p>"Uncle Dafu......"</p><p>"Well......Tianlei, Uncle Dafu didn't mean it earlier. Don't read too much into it."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei blinked but said nothing.</p><p>Sun Dafu's heart immediately raced with fear. Ever since he returned two days ago, his mind had been on edge, fearing that the matter would be exposed. He and Pu Lianhua could have an affair, but they could never live together. Therefore, he didn't want a divorce.</p><p>However, he was unwilling to give up the land above him. These conflicting emotions tormented him, making it feel like he had aged ten years in just two days.</p><p>So today, when he heard the knocking sound, his eyelids kept twitching uncontrollably. He lied to his wife, asking Du Xingfen to say that he wasn't home. But his guilty conscience made him sit up straight the moment Zhu Tianlei spoke. Now, he was even more afraid of Zhu Tianlei turning against him.</p><p>Truly, a sword hangs above one's head when it comes to lust!</p><p>"Uncle Dafu, you should be well aware of why I came here."</p><p>"Yes, yes, but Nephew, you know that everything in the family is decided by Auntie Dafu. What I say doesn't count. You see..."</p><p>"Oh, if that's the case, then I should directly negotiate with Auntie Dafu about this matter."</p><p>Having said that, Zhu Tianlei made a show of getting up to leave, scaring Sun Dafu into submission as he grabbed Zhu Tianlei's arm.</p><p>"Nephew, Nephew, don't be in such a hurry. Alright, I'll take charge of this matter and give you the land."</p><p>With his small tail being stepped on so hard, if Sun Dafu didn't want to be thrown out by Du Xingfen, he had to make a compromise, giving up his eight mu of fertile land.</p><p>"Then Uncle Dafu should come to the village hall tonight to sign the transfer contract!"</p><p>Having reached this point, Sun Dafu could only accept defeat. For now, he needed to think about how to fib and convince Du Xingfen back home.</p><p>With Sun Dafu's eight mu of land resolved, Zhu Tianlei felt relieved all over. He had no mind to ponder what was going on in Sun Dafu's head.</p><p>Just as Zhu Tianlei was leaving Sun Dafu's courtyard, his phone started ringing non-stop.</p><p>The call came from Mao Yu. If this call had arrived ten minutes earlier, Zhu Tianlei might not have had the courage to answer, but now things were different.</p><p>Hearing that Zhu Tianlei managed to resolve the land issue in just two days was quite a surprise for Mao Yu on the other end of the line. Recalling Min Shengjun's praise and commendation of Zhu Tianlei, he felt a sense of recognition for the first time.</p><p>After hanging up, Zhu Tianlei frowned, searched for a phone number on his device, and dialed it.</p><p>This call would make Ge Dong regret ever making it.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was not a vengeful person, but he could not tolerate Ge Dong daring to touch his woman, especially using those despicable and shameless methods.</p><p>Back at the clinic, Zhu Tianlei had Ma Lanlan help him calculate the costs, including the rent and compensation for selling the land, as well as a basic budget for setting up the pharmaceutical factory. He then added an additional 5% float on top of this budget.</p><p>"Tianlei, it's going to be nearly eighty thousand!"</p><p>Looking at the total on the scrap paper, Ma Lanlan's face fell.</p><p>Eighty thousand was astronomical; what Ma Lanlan previously thought was a dazzling star within reach suddenly seemed unattainably distant.</p><p>"That's fine, it's much less than I expected."</p><p>Ma Lanlan stared at Zhu Tianlei in shock, doubting whether he had heard the number correctly.</p><p>"Tianlei, it's eighty thousand."</p><p>"I know, don't worry. Money is not a problem."</p><p>Seeing Ma Lanlan's open-mouthed expression, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but chuckle inwardly; he knew exactly what she was thinking because just three days ago, he hadn't believed it either.</p><p>After organizing the data, Zhu Tianlei went to the village hall and, together with Yao Gang, used the only computer there to meticulously type out the "Tianlei Pharmaceutical Land Compensation Agreement."</p><p>That evening, lights were shining brightly in the village hall.</p><p>In the evening, Zhu Tianlei placed the contract, complete with the villagers' fingerprints and the Tianlei Pharmaceutical seal, under his pillow, his heart racing uncontrollably.</p><p>The next morning, just as Zhu Tianlei was getting out of bed, Mao Yu stood in their courtyard chatting idly with his mother.</p><p>It was strange; his mother was extremely wary of Hao Xinmei and not particularly fond of other girls, but she got along exceptionally well with the cold and sharp-tongued beauty, Mao Yu, who seemed almost as close as a parent would be.</p><p>"Xiaoyu, Auntie just cooked sweet potatoes in the pot, why don't you try some?"</p><p>"Great! How did Auntie know I love sweet potatoes?"</p><p>"Haha, you little thing, your mouth is so sweet."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at the black horse goddess who was always putting him down with a look of frustration. In front of his mom, she suddenly transformed into a considerate cotton sweater type, which made him feel chills run down his spine. He even secretly guessed if she might have some feelings for him.</p><p>"Mom, you seem to really like Maoyu?"</p><p>After dinner, taking advantage of the moment when Maoyu went to the bathroom, Zhu Tianlei whispered in his mom's ear.</p><p>"Yes, that girl is so gentle and considerate, much better than you, my naughty boy. Of course, I like her."</p><p>"Gentle? Mom, with what eyes do you see her as gentle? She's more like a tigress!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't agree with his mom and couldn't help but argue back.</p><p>"Cough cough, Mr. Zhu, who is the tigeress here?"</p><p>Maoyu appeared at the door with a smile on her face. Zhu Tianlei felt chills down his spine again, really, one shouldn't speak ill of people behind their backs!</p><p>"Xiaoyu, don't listen to Tianlei, in Auntie's eyes, there is no girl gentler than you!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at his mom desperately, was this his own mother?</p><p>"Xiaoyu, try the sweet potatoes I just cooked, okay?"</p><p>"How could I! How did you know I love sweet potatoes, Auntie?"</p><p>"Haha, you little thing, your mouth is so sweet."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei watched the black horse goddess, who always gave him a hard time with her expressions. In front of his mother, she suddenly turned into a considerate and caring person, which made him feel cold shivers run down his spine. He even secretly wondered if she had any feelings for him.</p><p>"Mom, you seem to really like Maoyu?"</p><p>After dinner, taking advantage of the moment when Maoyu went to the bathroom, Zhu Tianlei whispered in his mom's ear.</p><p>"Yes, that girl is so gentle and considerate, much better than you, my naughty boy. Of course, I like her."</p><p>"Gentle? Mom, with what eyes do you see her as gentle? She's more like a tigress!"</p><p>His mother's words made Zhu Tianlei disagree strongly, and he couldn't help but retort.</p><p>"Cough cough, Mr. Zhu, who is the tigeress here?"</p><p>Maoyu appeared at the door with a smile on her face. Zhu Tianlei felt his spine shiver again—really, one shouldn't speak ill of people behind their backs!</p><p>"Xiaoyu, don't listen to Tianlei. In Auntie's eyes, there is no girl gentler than you!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at his mom in despair. Was this really his own mother?</p><p>"Xiaoyu, try the sweet potatoes I just cooked; they’re delicious."</p><p>"How could I! How did you know I love sweet potatoes, Auntie?"</p><p>"Haha, Xiaoyu, your words are so sweet."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei watched the black horse goddess, who always made him feel frustrated with her demeanor. In front of his mother, she suddenly became a considerate and caring person, which sent shivers down his spine. He even wondered if she might have some feelings for him.</p><p>"Mom, you seem to really like Maoyu?"</p><p>After dinner, taking advantage of the moment when Maoyu went to the bathroom, Zhu Tianlei whispered in his mom's ear.</p><p>"Yes, that girl is so gentle and considerate—much better than you, my naughty boy.

Zhu Tianlei felt his spine shiver again—really, one shouldn’t speak ill of people behind their backs!</p><p>"Xiaoyu, don't listen to Tianlei; in Auntie’s eyes, there is no girl gentler than you!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at his mom in despair. Was this really his own mother?</p>

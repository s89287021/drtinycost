						<p>Máo Yǔ said, a single flagpole is the national flag. A company will not veer off course only if it cherishes its country. A single flagpole is also the factory flag. A company that possesses its own banner is like having a soul. Only a company with a soul will not become merely a tool for profit. The third type of flag is the banner of honor, which should not hang on the wall but rather float in the air so that all employees can see it daily; it serves as an inspiration and a spur.</p><p>At this moment, the national flag fluttered in the wind atop the central flagpole, making Zhū Tiānlěi's eyes well up with emotion.</p><p>"Máo Yǔ, thank you!"</p><p>Máo Yǔ looked at the national flag and was also moved. She had spent several years in America, on the bustling Wall Street, in the heart of the World Trade Center, a place teeming with business elites. The wealth created by Wall Street every day amazed the world.</p><p>The value she created daily far exceeded that of a small enterprise back home. However, no matter how much money she made, her heart always felt adrift and empty. Money could bring material satisfaction, but it could not enrich her soul. What she longed for, Wall Street could not provide.</p><p>However, in recent days, especially at this moment, Mao Yu felt that she had obtained what she wanted. What she desired was not in the World Trade Center, but in this remote village and on this fluttering red flag.</p><p>From that day onwards, the preparations for Tiānlěi Pharmaceutical formally entered a countdown.</p><p>On the very day all equipment arrived at the factory, Zhū Tiānlěi's six types of traditional Chinese medicine had already been finalized. Under Má Yǔ's active handling, the relevant approval procedures progressed smoothly.</p><p>On the autumnal equinox,</p><p>Zhū Tiānlěi's Tiānlěi Pharmaceutical officially opened for business.</p><p>Early in the morning, several women gathered around Zhū Tiānlěi in the courtyard of the Zhu family home.</p><p>"The color of this suit is not good."</p><p>Mǎ Lányán glanced at the Armani suit that Hào Xīnmei had bought for 20,000 yuan and said with a pursed lip.</p><p>"It's better to wear this one. It looks simple yet dignified."</p><p>Mǎ Lányán spent half a year's savings to specially buy a shirt for Zhū Tiānlěi in Yúnhǎichéng.</p><p>"Let him wear this one. This shirt suits Tiānlěi's style the best. No matter how good the clothes are, suitability is most important."</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue held a business T-shirt in her hand. Although it was just a T-shirt, she had worked hard and saved for several months to buy it.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao stood outside the group of women, feeling slightly inferior. Compared to them, she felt like a weed, neither beautiful nor fragrant, more like a withered flower. So at this moment, she didn't say anything and wanted to leave.</p><p>"Yuntao, come help me adjust this collar; you're so handy."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei called out.</p><p>The three women's gazes immediately fell on Zhang Yuntao.</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei hadn't explicitly stated his relationship with them, each of these women was exceptionally smart, hence the underlying tension.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao had initially wanted to refuse but seeing Zhu Tianlei's encouraging, warm, and affectionate look, she shyly walked over.</p><p>In the end, to not disappoint the women's good intentions, Zhu Tianlei wore all the clothes on himself.</p><p>The innermost layer was the T-shirt, then the shirt, followed by the suit.</p><p>"How handsome? Aren't you stunned?"</p><p>After dressing up properly, Zhu Tianlei looked at the women and asked in a smirking tone.</p><p>However, people are what they wear. At this moment, Zhu Tianlei in his tailored suit and shoes was unrecognizable from his usual self. If he put away his playful demeanor, he indeed had the air of a domineering CEO.</p><p>The women's hearts couldn't help but flutter.</p><p>"My son is so handsome!"</p><p>By the time Zhu Tianlei left, Hou Suqin glanced at her son with immense pride.</p><p>Although Zhu Quezi did not say anything, his eyes betrayed everything.</p><p>The entire family set off for Lianggang in grand fashion.</p><p>From the village to Lianggang, after Mao Yu and Zhu Tianlei had discussed it, they invested another ten thousand yuan to build a road.</p><p>Now, the road from the village to Lianggang was packed with villagers from Haguogou and nearby villages, all eagerly anticipating this moment.</p><p>Entire families came together, everyone left their homes, and the streets were deserted—these three phrases were not an exaggeration in this case.</p><p>Today, Tianlei Pharmaceutical was a sight to behold. The children from the village primary school wore neat uniforms, held flowers and trumpets, and laughed like blossoms.</p><p>At 9:58 AM, eighteen cannon shots rang out, deafeningly loud, with white smoke drifting into the air. The smell of gunpowder oddly carried a fragrant aroma.</p><p>The original plan for the ribbon-cutting ceremony was to be handled by several village cadres led by Yao Gang, but just before it began, a few cars slowly arrived and lined up in front of the factory gate.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's, as well as everyone else's, attention was immediately drawn to them.</p><p>Wow, upon closer count, there were ten cars.</p><p>As the car doors opened, Zhu Tianlei's expression changed instantly, and Hao Xinmei was equally surprised.</p><p>Stepping out were none other than Mayor Yang Wenjie of Yunhai City and the mysterious Ma Lao.</p><p>Following him was Deputy Mayor Wu Pingjian. Although Zhu Tianlei did not recognize those who got out later, Hao Xinmei knew that each of them was a prominent figure in the city.</p><p>What kind of abilities does Zhu Tianlei have?</p><p>At this point, Hao Xinmei felt completely unable to fathom Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Haha, Tianlei, you've done such a big thing, why didn't you tell your old man me?"</p><p>Ma Laowu chuckled as he walked over. Though it sounded like a scolding, his face was brimming with joy.</p><p>"Little Zhu, did you know that when Ma Laowu heard about your factory, he was so excited that he couldn't stop smiling for days, saying he hadn't made a wrong choice in you? Today, I see that you're indeed no ordinary young man!"</p><p>Yang Wenjie didn't hide his admiration and praise for Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Wu Pingjian naturally wouldn't be left behind either.</p><p>"Little Zhu, not only are you young and skilled in medicine with high ethics, but you're also actively starting a business to benefit the local community. You're a role model for modern young people! Today, Mayor Yang and I brought all the city leaders here so that everyone can personally see this young exemplar!"</p><p>The crowd following Wu Pingjian all had grins on their faces, joining in the laughter, but shock rippled through their minds. For the entire leadership team to come down to attend a business opening ceremony was something they couldn't imagine.</p><p>Especially when they found out that Zhu Tianlei wasn't the son of an official or a wealthy family, nor was he any famous hero—just an ordinary, hometown-raised rural youth—they were each so shocked that their jaws dropped.</p><p>The onlookers in the village were even more astonished.</p>

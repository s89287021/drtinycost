						<p>Lu Guang spoke a lot, until his eyes rolled back, and it became difficult for him to speak. The details of the things he entrusted were astonishing; one man raising five children was unimaginably arduous.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei’s hand had been supporting Lu Guang’s wrist all along, but nobody knew that he had almost transferred 100% of his spiritual energy to Lu Guang.</p><p>"Doctor... I want to know your name..."</p><p>Lu Guang suddenly asked with great effort.</p><p>"My name is Zhu Tianlei."</p><p>"Zh... Tianlei... cough cough, I... am so happy...."</p><p>As soon as he said these words, Lu Guang’s hand dropped sharply, falling heavily on the edge of the hospital bed.</p><p>Lu Guang was dead!</p><p>Lu Guang's death seemed like a bomb filled with blood and despair, turning the originally calm isolation ward into one full of oppression. The patients cried out in waves, even the medical staff had faces ashen with sorrow.</p><p>Lu Guang’s body was taken to the autopsy room. According to the regulations for infectious disease prevention, the bodies of infected patients could be dissected. Although Zhu Tianlei initially resisted, he also knew that Lu Guang's body might be the most crucial part in understanding the illness.</p><p>After the autopsy, both the doctors involved and Zhu Tianlei were so disgusted by what they saw that they almost vomited on the spot.</p><p>Lu Guang’s internal organs had already rotted, and not only that, white sac-like insects crawled all over the rotting wounds, constantly gnawing at the already decayed organs.</p><p>After stabilizing his emotions for a long time, Zhu Tianlei knew that Lu Guang's cause of death was not an infectious disease. However, this discovery did nothing to alleviate his mood.</p><p>Since inheriting the Immortal Medical Art, everyone he had saved had recovered, including Ge Tianying who was on the brink of death with only one breath left.</p><p>He always felt that his medical skills were truly capable of bringing the dead back to life. He hadn't shown any pride, but deep down, there was a bit of arrogance.</p><p>But Lu Guang's death shattered his arrogance.</p><p>Although the cause of Lu Guang's death was announced, it did not alleviate the tense atmosphere in the quarantine zone at all. Despair intensified and even led to some patients desperately shouting that they wanted to leave the quarantine zone.</p><p>The number of incoming patients continued to rise, as did the number of infected medical staff. Li Ping and Li Yong watched Zhu Tianlei become increasingly gaunt with a sense of helplessness.</p><p>Despite continuous support from ahead, medical personnel could not enter on a large scale. Without them, treatment efforts were extremely difficult to conduct.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at his phone; he knew that Mayor Yang had given him substantial backing. A mayor personally calling every day to check in on him was an honor not everyone received.</p><p>Tang Wen also strongly supported him, but the hospital needed to function, and the number of medical staff was limited. Even when additional staff were transferred, they could not keep up with the influx of patients.</p><p>He felt his limitations; previously, he had relied on his own methods for treatment, but now that over a hundred patients were in the quarantine zone, his individual efforts were insufficient.</p><p>Ultimately, he resorted to administering antibiotics to resist the virus. However, everyone knew that extensive antibiotic use was harmful to patient health.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had never felt so insignificant, as if his doubts began to consume him.</p><p>"Mayor Yang, I......"</p><p>The call connected, but Zhu Tianlei hesitated.</p><p>He wasn't good at making requests, especially for medical treatment.</p><p>"Tianlei, if you have anything to say, just go ahead. I've instructed the Health Bureau to release the latest epidemic control notification. Currently, approximately seven hundred cases have been identified nationwide, but as Cloud Sea City was the first region to discover a case, the provincial health department and the national CDC are paying close attention. A specialized investigation team will soon arrive at the hospital......"</p><p>After receiving this notification, Yang Wenjie was excited. He knew that Zhu Tianlei was under immense pressure but was stubbornly silent about his difficulties, often learning about situations from others.</p><p>"Mayor Yang, we don't have enough staff. I think......"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei started to speak but couldn't continue. The person who had been sharp-tongued in the arbitration hall and eloquent on TV like a wind-cutting blade was now like a child just learning to speak.</p><p>"Tianlei, you finally told me the truth. Don't worry; the city has issued a call for reinforcements. By the end of the day after tomorrow, a team of about thirty medical professionals will enter the quarantine zone."</p><p>He had a phone call with Yang Wenjie, and Zhu Tianlei felt a bit of relief for the first time in days. He left his office, stretched, and began his daily routine: room rounds.</p><p>“Sis, your breasts are really big! My dad says that women with big breasts aren't intelligent. Are you too?”</p><p>Hearing the voice from the ward, Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but chuckle. Little Gangpeng was very energetic and lively; even at a young age, he knew how to ask pretty nurses to give him injections. If they weren’t attractive, this little boy would complain of headaches and sore bottoms and refuse cooperation. Now, he had even learned to flirt with the girls.</p><p>“Little pervert, what nonsense are you talking about? Don't say such things again, or I’ll give you a good smack on your bottom!”</p><p>Nurse Xiao Han also liked Little Gangpeng, but being teased by this little troublemaker made her feel embarrassed. So she fiercely threatened him.</p><p>“Sis is not gentle at all and is so mean. No man will want to marry you in the future! Or maybe I’ll marry Sis when I grow up!”</p><p>Puh!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn’t help but laugh out loud.</p><p>“Who is it? Who's eavesdropping on my conversation with Sis?”</p><p>Helplessly, Zhu Tianlei opened the door and saw Little Gangpeng sitting on the bed with a serious face, while Nurse Xiao Han stood by with a depressed expression.</p><p>“It’s Big Brother, hehe, Big Brother! We’re both men; you know what I’m talking about!”</p><p>The moment Little Gangpeng saw Zhu Tianlei, his serious face immediately broke into a flower-like smile, accompanied by a touch of flattery.</p><p>“How are you feeling today?”</p><p>Facing this youngest patient, Zhu Tianlei spent the most effort. Apart from basic care, he did everything personally, so they had a deep bond.</p><p>"It was painful, but my sister just gave me a kiss, so I'm not feeling bad anymore!"</p><p>Xiao Han didn't expect Xiao Gangpeng to say something like that. Although children speak without restraint, her face turned bright red with embarrassment.</p><p>Upon hearing Xiao Gangpeng's words, Zhu Tianlei's expression suddenly darkened.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei rarely showed his displeasure, especially when dealing with patients and medical staff. He was always gentle and kind, no matter how tired or exhausted he was, even when faced with the demands of difficult patients.</p><p>"Xiao Han, don't you know the requirements for nursing patients?"</p><p>Xiao Han's face turned pale as she lowered her head.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, I was wrong!"</p><p>"It was painful, but my sister just gave me a kiss, so I'm not feeling bad anymore!"</p><p>Xiao Han didn't expect Xiao Gangpeng to say something like that. Although children speak without reservation, her face turned bright red with embarrassment.</p><p>Upon hearing Xiao Gangpeng's words, Zhu Tianlei's expression suddenly darkened.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei rarely showed his displeasure, especially when dealing with patients and medical staff.

Although children speak without reserve, her face flushed with embarrassment.</p><p>Upon hearing Xiao Gangpeng's words, Zhu Tianlei's expression darkened noticeably.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei rarely showed his displeasure, especially when dealing with patients and medical staff. He was always gentle and kind, no matter how tired or exhausted he was, even when faced with the demands of difficult patients.</p><p>"Xiao Han, don't you know the requirements for nursing patients?"</p><p>Xiao Han's face paled as she lowered her head in shame.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, I was wrong!"</p>

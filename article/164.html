						<p>"Doctor Zhu, I didn't mean anything by it; I just thought this little girl was very pretty and about the same age as my son..."</p><p>Seeing Doctor Zhu's expression, Mao Fang hurriedly explained.</p><p>"It's nothing, I just noticed that you look a bit like Mao Yu..."</p><p>This was something Doctor Zhu had noticed when observing Mao Fang. Although there was a significant age difference between them, their facial features were remarkably similar.</p><p>"Oh!"</p><p>To his surprise, as soon as Doctor Zhu said this, the cup of hot water in Mao Fang's hand clattered to the ground, spilling scalding water that instantly burned a blister on Mao Fang's wrist.</p><p>"Are you okay?"</p><p>Mao Yu, who had just returned with water, happened to witness this scene and quickly ran over. Bending down, she grabbed Mao Fang's hand and blew on it vigorously.</p><p>"Just wait, I'll go get some burn ointment from the nurse."</p><p>Mao Yu turned to leave but was pulled back by Mao Fang.</p><p>"Are you Xiao Yu?"</p><p>Mao Yu was taken aback.</p><p>"How did you know my name is Mao Yu?... Oh, I see, Doctor Zhu must have told you..."</p><p>Before Mao Yu could respond further, she noticed that tears were welling up in Mao Fang's eyes and then began to fall like rain.</p><p>"Auntie, what's wrong with you?"</p><p>Mao Yu was puzzled. Meanwhile, Doctor Zhu's expression turned somber.</p><p>Two people share the surname Mao, and they also look very similar. Looking at Mao Fang's reaction, this matter is probably not simple.</p><p>"Xiao Yu, I am not your aunt, I am your mother!"</p><p>What?</p><p>Mao Yu was struck by lightning.</p><p>"Auntie, did you mistake me for someone else? I do have a mother, but she passed away two years ago..."</p><p>"Xiao Yu, I am really your mother. Is your father named Mao Aiguo, and your grandmother Wang Chunhua, and your grandfather Mao Ling..."</p><p>Mao Fang was already sobbing uncontrollably, gripping Mao Yu's hand tighter and tighter.</p><p>"How do you know?"</p><p>"My name is Mao Fang."</p><p>Mao Yu repeated the words "Mao Fang" over and over again.</p><p>"Are you my aunt?"</p><p>She remembered. When she was very young, her grandfather and grandmother had mentioned that she had an aunt. However, after going to university, they lost contact with the family, and she never returned.</p><p>When she was little, Mao Yu often fantasized about what her aunt might look like. But as time passed and her grandfather and grandmother passed away, the name Mao Fang gradually faded from memory.</p><p>"I am not your aunt; you are my daughter, my biological daughter whom I entrusted to my brother and sister-in-law to raise!"</p><p>Mao Fang felt as if all the blood in her body was flowing backward.</p><p>Back then, she had become pregnant with her first love out of wedlock. Afraid of taking responsibility, the man disappeared without a trace when she went into labor. She was only twenty years old at the time and could not possibly raise the child alone.</p><p>Just as Big Brother and Big Sister had been married for three years without having any children, her child became their daughter under the arrangement of her parents. </p><p>Later, she passed the civil service exam and got a government job. She then met Jiao Kang through an introduction and they dated for a year before getting married. Two years later, they had a son.</p><p>She originally thought that everything in the past was over, but as her son grew older, she began to miss her daughter more and more. She dared not tell Jiao Kang about it; she could only suppress her longing deep inside.</p><p>It wasn’t until four years ago, when her son went to college and their relationship had stabilized to an unshakable level, that she gathered the courage to tell Jiao Kang about this matter. To her surprise, not only did Jiao Kang not blame her, but he even strongly supported her in reuniting with her daughter.</p><p>However, twenty years had passed, and when he rushed to Big Brother and Big Sister’s place, he discovered that Big Brother had already died ten years ago, and Big Sister had succumbed to cancer two years prior. As for Mao Yu, she was nowhere to be found.</p><p>She thought she would never have the chance to see her daughter again, but she ended up seeing the heart of her heart after twenty years of longing. She couldn’t let go; she didn’t want to let go.</p><p>"No, you’ve mistaken me for someone else. My mother is named Wang Ling, I am Wang Ling’s daughter, you’ve made a mistake..."</p><p>Mao Yu suddenly pulled away from Mao Fang's grip, repeatedly saying that she was the wrong person before pushing open the door and running out.</p><p>"Xiaoyu..."</p><p>Mao Fang let out a wail and collapsed on the ground.</p><p>This scene was so clichéd and unbelievable that Zhu Tianlei had a moment of stunned silence.</p><p>But he quickly reacted, helping Mao Fang off the ground.</p><p>"Director Mao, this is such an unexpected turn of events; it’s natural for Xiaoyu to be unable to accept it. Don’t worry, I’ll go see what’s happening with her..."</p><p>Saying that, Zhu Tianlei ran after her as well.</p><p>Underneath the willow tree beside the stone bridge at the hospital, Mao Yu stood quietly, the autumn breeze blowing through and swaying the willow branches, lifting the hem of her dress.</p><p>"Tianlei, do you know that my mother has schizophrenia? When she’s not having an episode, no one can tell that she’s sick. She’s just like all other mothers in the world, cooking for me, braiding my hair. But during an episode, she becomes terrifying; she pinned me against the wall once and I nearly suffocated..."</p><p>Feeling the breath of Zhu Tianlei behind her, Mao Yu quietly opened her mouth.</p><p>"That time I was very afraid, but fortunately, there was my father. He could protect me, but he also passed away, leaving only me and my mother. My father's death made my mother's illness worse, and I felt like life wasn't worth living. I thought about running away from home, but seeing my mother's tears when she was lucid made it unbearable for me."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't speak; he just listened to Mao Yu recount the long-forgotten past.</p><p>"I studied hard, reading day and night, and I even topped the entire grade, the county, and even the city. Others thought I was ambitious and wanted to make a name for myself, but that wasn't true. I just wanted to leave my mother and that home. So when Stanford University in the United States came recruiting, I was the first to apply. On the day I received the acceptance letter, I left, like I was fleeing from her."</p><p>Tears rolled down Mao Yu's eyes, a sight Zhu Tianlei had never seen before.</p><p>"I worked hard in America, putting in long hours just to numb myself and forget everything, until I received news of my mother's passing. I didn't even get to see her last breath. People say she kept calling out my name as she was dying, wailing......"</p><p>Mao Yu's cries gradually intensified, carried away by the autumn wind.</p><p>"But now, a woman has come forward and said she is my mother. What about all those years of effort I put in? Were they all for nothing? Does she have the right to be my mother? If she gave birth to me but didn't take care of me, why is she here now, ah, what?"</p><p>Mao Yu's voice was hoarse, as if trying to release all the pent-up sorrow and frustration from her heart.</p><p>"Xiaoyu, the heavens took away the mother who raised you and now has sent your blood-related mother back to you. You should be happy. In this world, you are not alone; you still have a mother. She sincerely repents and wants to make amends. Even if you don't give her a chance, at least give yourself a chance for a new beginning!"</p>

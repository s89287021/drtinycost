						<p>The little girl's pulse had no gastric divine root, and the rhythm was chaotic; it turned out she was poisoned.</p><p>"Are you a reporter from the television station?"</p><p>However, Huang Hai graduated from the Media University with strong journalistic sensitivity and, after nearly eight years of work experience, he could almost be certain that Zhu Tianlei was definitely a person with a story worth digging into. He didn't expect to meet the man so quickly again.</p><p>Huang Hai politely replied. This was a professional skill for journalists, and Huang Hai performed well.</p><p>"The situation of this girl is somewhat complicated, and it might involve some illegal activities. Do you think your station would be willing to report on such matters?"</p><p>Huang Hai was stunned and couldn't understand Zhu Tianlei's meaning. Illegal activities?</p><p>"Of course. Our program's mission is to speak for the people and specifically report on unfairness and injustice in society."</p><p>However, after hesitating for two or three seconds, Huang Hai quickly reacted.</p><p>Come on, he wouldn't refuse such excellent news material.</p><p>"Then could reporter Huang help contact some staff from the law enforcement bureau and drug administration? This matter must be covered under camera to make it more realistic. If possible, officers from the police station could also be present."</p><p>Huang Hai was stunned again.</p><p>What kind of play was Zhu Tianlei putting on? He wasn't lacking contacts in these departments; after all, as a journalist, such connections and channels were essential. However, this didn't mean he had special privileges to easily get cooperation from public officials of state agencies for his news report.</p><p>"Reporter Huang, I can guarantee that this news will definitely become the most popular story in your program this quarter, if not this year."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei wore a faint smile on his face, but there was no doubt about the authenticity of his words.</p><p>"Huang Hai, have you thought it through? The meeting at the station emphasized repeatedly that we must not abuse our power. Who knows where this brat came from? If you call everyone over and nothing happens in the end, your golden journalist career will be over."</p><p>Director Zhou Zheng and Huang Hai were university classmates and both ended up working at the city television station after graduation, later becoming colleagues on the same program. Their relationship was naturally extraordinary, and these words were entirely from Huang Hai's perspective.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei remained silent and glanced at the girl's mother kneeling beside him. This woman was strangely indifferent; she had been seen crying her heart out on TV, but now she didn't even look at her daughter once.</p><p>Huang Hai hesitated.</p><p>He was a journalist whose lifelong pursuit was to be a truthful and honest news worker. Moreover, his instincts told him that Zhu Tianlei was someone he could trust.</p><p>"Zhou Zheng, keep the camera rolling; I'll make some calls."</p><p>Zhou Zheng knew that Huang Hai had already made up his mind.</p><p>Though reluctant, he didn't say anything more. Huang Hai's integrity and inflexibility had been known since his sophomore year in college. Furthermore, Huang Hai was very stubborn once he made a decision, and it would take ten oxen to pull him back.</p><p>Watching his fellow classmate and good friend leave the crowd, Zhou Zheng sighed.</p><p>"Doctor Xue, prepare a bottle of saline solution and bandages."</p><p>Xue Ping had been standing beside Zhu Tianlei. After the previous incident, her admiration for Zhu Tianlei might have surpassed her feelings towards Shen Feng, but she still felt ashamed and timid in front of Zhu Tianlei due to her past mistake that nearly cost someone their life.</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, she hurriedly got up and ran back to the ambulance, her tense expression mixed with excitement, even more nervous than when she first participated in a cadaver dissection class.</p><p>The accompanying young doctor looked at Xue Ping in confusion. Usually proud and calm Senior Sister Xue, what was happening to her?</p><p>The crowd grew larger, with murmurs rising and falling.</p><p>The girl who had been moaning on the ground for some time suddenly fell silent, although her face remained pale and frightening as she looked around without saying a word.</p><p>"Comrade, I am Huang Hai, a journalist from the Yunhai People's Livelihood Column. Sorry to trouble you!"</p><p>As it was a county town and all administrative agencies were merged, it took less than twenty minutes for several groups to arrive at the scene. Huang Hai briefly explained the situation before leading everyone towards the girl.</p><p>"Everyone is here now, you can speak up."</p><p>As Huang Hai spoke, all eyes, including those of the cameras, turned to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced around casually and then said slowly,</p><p>"This little girl has been poisoned."</p><p>What?</p><p>The crowd stirred as soon as Zhu Tianlei's words fell.</p><p>"How could that be? Didn't they say she took medicine? What was it called? Oh, right, the beauty pill. Could it be that the beauty pill is poisonous?"</p><p>The first witness to cooperate with Huang Hai in the investigation spoke up, her eyes still filled with suspicion towards Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"That's right, who are you? The doctor hasn't even spoken yet, how do you know this girl was poisoned?"</p><p>A wave of skepticism erupted from the crowd.</p><p>"The diagnosis he made is our diagnosis."</p><p>Xue Ping looked at the surrounding crowd and said sternly, each word deliberate,</p><p>"Comrades from the Drug Administration, Enforcement Bureau, and Police Department, I commissioned Huang Hai to invite all of you here because this matter involves complicated issues. Firstly, there are people making and selling fake goods; secondly, there are those deliberately framing others; thirdly, there is someone attempting murder intentionally."</p><p>Words that don't shock aren't worth saying.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words were increasingly terrifying. Just as a gust of autumn wind blew up, it made the onlookers shiver involuntarily, but their enthusiasm for watching only grew higher.</p><p>Huang Hai's heart skipped a beat. If Zhu Tianlei was telling the truth, then this news would indeed be the most challenging one he had encountered in his career.</p><p>"Now, it's live broadcast, with no chance of editing. Are you sure you can take responsibility for what you're saying?"</p><p>"Of course. If there's one thing wrong, I'll go back with these two police officers and turn myself in."</p><p>These words were spoken with incredible confidence, but Huang Hai's heart actually settled.</p>

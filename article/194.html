						<p>"No one has come into contact with it."</p><p>Yao Jianxiong's gaze lingered for a very short time, almost like the blink of an eye, but that glance was enough!</p><p>"I heard Mu Mu often goes around the material department..."</p><p>"It definitely can't be Mu Mu, I guarantee it!"</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, Yao Jianxiong immediately became somewhat agitated and subconsciously moved closer to Yan Mumu, as if trying to give her strength and shield her from Zhu Tianlei's gaze.</p><p>"Jianxiong, you know the company rules. If the company secrets are leaked and cause economic losses, not only will you be dismissed, but legal responsibility will also be pursued. Have you thought this through?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke slowly, Yao Jianxiong's face turning pale inch by inch, his shoulder movements indicating his current state of mind.</p><p>"I..... Chairman, it's me, I'm willing to take the responsibility."</p><p>"Big Brother Jianxiong!"</p><p>Hearing Yao Jianxiong's words, Yan Mumu's face immediately turned ashen.</p><p>"Mumu, go back home, this has nothing to do with you."</p><p>Seeing that Yao Jianxiong didn't blame her and was still thinking of protecting her at this moment, Yan Mumu's tears flowed down in a rush.</p><p>"Big Brother Jianxiong, you're so silly......"</p><p>Yan Mumu looked at Yao Jianxiong, her tears falling like a light rain.</p><p>"Chairman, it's me, I secretly copied the formula and gave it to someone else, I leaked the formula, it has nothing to do with Big Brother Jianxiong. If the Chairman wants to punish me, go ahead! Whatever it is, I'll accept it!"</p><p>"Mumu, what are you saying, it was me who leaked the information, not Mumu!"</p><p>"No one has come into contact with it."</p><p>Yao Jianxiong's gaze lingered for a brief moment, almost imperceptibly, but that glance was enough!</p><p>"I heard Mu Mu often visits the material department..."</p><p>"It can't be Mu Mu, I guarantee it!"</p><p>Upon hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, Yao Jianxiong became visibly agitated and subconsciously moved closer to Yan Mumu as if trying to bolster her courage and shield her from Zhu Tianlei's gaze.</p><p>"Jianxiong, you know the company rules. If company secrets are leaked and result in economic losses, not only will you be dismissed, but legal action will also be taken against you. Have you thought this through?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke slowly, Yao Jianxiong's face paling with each passing moment, his shoulder movements clearly indicating his distress.</p><p>"I..... Chairman, it's me, I'm willing to take responsibility."</p><p>"Big Brother Jianxiong!"</p><p>Hearing Yao Jianxiong's words, Yan Mumu's face immediately turned ashen.</p><p>"Mumu, go home, this has nothing to do with you."</p><p>Seeing that Yao Jianxiong didn't blame her and was still trying to protect her at this crucial moment, Yan Mumu's tears streamed down uncontrollably.</p><p>"Big Brother Jianxiong, you're so foolish......"</p><p>Yan Mumu looked at Yao Jianxiong, tears falling like a gentle rain.</p><p>"Chairman, it's me who secretly copied the formula and gave it to someone else. I leaked the formula; it has nothing to do with Big Brother Jianxiong. If the Chairman wants to punish me, go ahead! Whatever it is, I'll accept it!"</p><p>"Mumu, what are you saying? It was me who leaked the information, not Mumu!"</p><p>"Nobody has come into contact with it."</p><p>Yao Jianxiong's gaze flickered for a mere moment, almost like a blink, yet it was enough.</p><p>"I heard that Mu Mu often visits the material department..."</p><p>"It definitely can't be Mu Mu, I guarantee it!"</p><p>Hearing Zhu Tianlei's words, Yao Jianxiong became visibly agitated and subconsciously moved closer to Yan Mumu, as if trying to bolster her courage and shield her from Zhu Tianlei's gaze.</p><p>"Jianxiong, you know the company rules. If any secrets are leaked and result in economic losses, not only will you be dismissed, but legal responsibility will also be pursued. Have you thought this through?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke slowly, Yao Jianxiong's face paling with each passing moment, his shoulder movements clearly indicating his distress.</p><p>"I..... Chairman, it's me; I'm willing to take the blame."</p><p>"Big Brother Jianxiong!"</p><p>Hearing Yao Jianxiong's words, Yan Mumu's face immediately turned ashen.</p><p>"Mumu, go home. This has nothing to do with you."</p><p>Seeing that Yao Jianxiong didn't blame her and was still trying to protect her at this crucial moment, Yan Mumu's tears streamed down uncontrollably.</p><p>"Big Brother Jianxiong, you're so foolish......"</p><p>Yan Mumu looked at Yao Jianxiong, tears falling like a gentle rain.</p><p>"Chairman, it was me who secretly copied the formula and gave it to someone else. I leaked the formula; it has nothing to do with Big Brother Jianxiong. If the Chairman wants to punish me, go ahead! Whatever it is, I'll accept it!"</p><p>"Mumu, what are you saying? It was me who leaked the information, not Mumu!"</p><p>"It's me, the Chairman. It's me; punish me!"</p><p>......</p><p>Watching Yao Jianxiong and Yan Mumu eagerly take responsibility for themselves, Zhu Tianlei finally put his heart at ease.</p><p>"Yan Mumu."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei called out.</p><p>"Chairman... what did you just call me?"</p><p>Yan Mumu was taken aback. She had never told anyone her real surname, not even Yao Jianxiong. How did Zhu Tianlei know?</p><p>"Take a look!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei picked up a document from the table and handed it to Yan Mumu.</p><p>Yan Mumu's eyes widened in shock as she received the document. Upon reading its contents, she felt a mix of emotions.</p><p>This was an acquisition agreement. In the legal representative section of the acquired company, it clearly stated 'Yan Guanhai' in black and white. Yan Guanhai was her grandfather.</p><p>Moreover, the acquisition agreement detailed that all disabled workers under the small pharmaceutical factory would become formal employees of Tianlei Pharmaceuticals through normal labor procedures, enjoying social insurance benefits provided by the government, as well as additional commercial insurance.</p><p>"Jianxiong, you are a man of integrity and righteousness; I did not choose wrongly!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was very satisfied with Yao Jianxiong. Although Yao Jianxiong had indeed carelessly leaked the recipe this time, Zhu Tianlei believed that Yao Jianxiong would do better in the future, and he had confidence in him.</p><p>Holding the acquisition agreement, Yan Mumu suddenly bowed deeply to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Chairman, with your magnanimous heart and forgiveness of past grievances, I represent my grandfather, my father, and those disabled elders to thank you!"</p><p>Yan Mumu's gratitude came from the heart.</p><p>"Alright, go back to Yunhai City and get packed up. Come back to school to continue your studies in the next couple of days. After graduation, if you wish, the doors of Tianlei Pharmaceutical will always be open for you."</p><p>Yan Mumu's eyes were red, and she left the office alongside Yao Jianxiong, who looked puzzled.</p><p>The merger documents were completed, and the merger plan was proceeding smoothly. Mao Yu volunteered to take on all the merger work, the reason being obvious.</p><p>When Yan Mumu left Tianlei Pharmaceutical, half of the company's staff came to see her off. Zhang Yuntao even had red-rimmed eyes, holding onto Yan Mumu's hand tightly and unwilling to let go.</p><p>Yan Mumu carried a huge backpack filled with gifts from everyone. She took three steps back at each one as she walked towards the company gate. Suddenly, she turned around, placed her hands on her mouth, and shouted with all her might.</p><p>"I'll be back! I will definitely come back!"</p><p>Yan Mumu's arrival brought temporary happiness to Tianlei Pharmaceutical. After she left, Zhang Yuntao had red-rimmed eyes for two consecutive days, which tugged at Zhu Tianlei's heartstrings.</p><p>"Yuntao, look, what is this?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was holding a grass-woven cricket, with a red string tied around its body, looking lifelike. When Zhu Tianlei held it, it twitched slightly, even the antennae looked real.</p><p>"Just smile, my Yuntao hasn't smiled in two days!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sat next to Zhang Yuntao and hugged her shoulder. Zhang Yuntao had just washed her hair, and the faint scent of shampoo wafted out, making Zhu Tianlei grab her hair and kiss it a few times.</p><p>"Tianlei, will Xiaomu really come back?"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao held the cricket Zhu Tianlei had made with his own hands and asked tearfully.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's heart felt sour. Would Zhang Yuntao be able to react like this even if he left?</p><p>"Of course she will. That girl is already in her third year of college and is said to start an internship next summer, so you'll see her then!"</p><p>Although jealous, Zhu Tianlei still gently consoled Zhang Yuntao.</p><p>This woman was like a ball of water, exquisitely delicate. It seemed that all her courage and spunk had been used up in betraying him and killing Hu Dainiu.</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao tilted her head back, resembling a jasmine flower blooming in mist. Her red lips quivered, much like a fluttering butterfly perched on a branch.</p><p>Unable to resist, Zhu Tianlei lowered his head and lightly kissed her.</p><p>Zhang Yuntao closed her eyes, savoring the warm sensation on her lips as her white nightgown was swept away by a large hand.</p><p>Her beautiful curves were perfectly captured in the mirror, with peaks standing tall and hills painted like a landscape.</p><p>Starting from above, Zhu Tianlei explored with his lips and tongue, gradually unfolding the red plum blossoms atop the peaks. One hand held the peak before him as he watched the red plum blossoms tremble like ripples at its tip.</p><p>Initially biting her lip to endure the pleasure and desire of being explored, Zhang Yuntao could no longer suppress herself as alluring moans escaped her throat.</p><p>"Sweetheart, are you comfortable?"</p><p>"Sweetheart, it seems to have grown bigger!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei knew Zhang Yuntao too well—her person, her heart, and the most sensitive parts about this matter. Therefore, while continuing to tremble the peaks, he whispered in her ear.</p><p>"Mmm... Tianlei..."</p><p>Zhang Yuntao's body softened like cotton, and her form leaning against the mirror lacked any strength.</p><p>"Call your husband."</p><p>"I can't call him... hmm..."</p><p>Zhang Yuntao's face was burning hot as if scorched by a fire cloud.</p>

						<p>The paper-thin windows had excellent light transmission. Combined with the dim yellow glow inside the room, everything was laid bare before Zhu Tianlei's eyes.</p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p>Chen Fanglin, who was kneeling beside Zhang Yuntao and pulling on his clothes, had a greenish luster to his face, like a wolf immersed in the excitement of hunting.</p><p>Saliva dripped from his mouth as he looked at Zhang Yuntao, who had lost consciousness on the bed. His weathered face turned red, and his hands moved swiftly, showing no signs of being over fifty years old.</p><p>However, after carefully selecting his moment, closing the windows and doors, and making all necessary preparations, he hadn't expected that his plans would still be disrupted, in a manner so sudden and unforgettable.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had broken into the house through the window.</p><p>The wooden frame, around twenty years old, had long rotted due to wind and rain erosion. Without external force, it might have lasted for some time, but now, Zhu Tianlei's anger, like that of a cheetah, shattered the doors and windows.</p><p>Chen Fanglin was stunned. Before he could figure out what was happening, he fell flat on his back with a thud.</p><p>The cabinets in the house had been made by someone Chen Fanglin had hired for his son's wedding, and to his surprise, they were of such good quality. Chen Fanglin felt as if his bones were shattered, his internal organs about to be crushed.</p><p>"It's you again... You little brat..."</p><p>When Chen Fanglin realized who was standing before him, he flew into a rage, remembering the last time Zhu Tianlei had interrupted his plans and kicked him onto the bed where he lay for a week.</p><p>New grievances and old grudges ignited Chen Fanglin's anger to an extreme.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you little turtle bastard, how dare you hit me? Think about it—this little slut is only for you, Zhu Tianlei, not for me, Chen Fanglin?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei jumped down from the bed. First, he glanced at Zhang Yuntao lying on it, noticing that she had her eyes tightly shut, her cheeks flushed, and though her breathing was somewhat hurried, there were no obvious signs of distress. Most importantly, apart from two buttons being undone on her outer garment, her clothes were intact. Only then did Zhu Tianlei turn his gaze to Chen Fanglin.</p><p>"I remember I said that Zhang Yuntao is my woman."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's voice was soft, so soft that Chen Fanglin wasn't sure if he had heard it correctly.</p><p>However, the coldness emanating from Zhu Tianlei was incredibly real. With each step closer, Chen Fanglin felt the air around him freezing a little more, until he was enveloped in an icy chill as if he had fallen into an ice cave.</p><p>"You......you......what are you going to do?"</p><p>Chen Fanglin had been a militia captain when he was younger and had a natural sensitivity to danger. He looked at Zhu Tianlei and felt even more timid than he had during the encounter with wild wolves in Black Tiger Forest thirty years ago.</p><p>"Chen Fanglin, which hand touched Yun Tao?"</p><p>"Eh...... what do you mean?"</p><p>Chen Fanglin leaned against the cabinet, continuously shrinking back, but since the cabinet was behind him, all he could do was curl up his legs, and the distance between them still narrowed.</p><p>"Which hand touched Yun Tao?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei stood in front of Chen Fanglin, bending down. His dark eyes seemed to contain primordial power from the universe.</p><p>Chen Fanglin shivered.</p><p>"I touched it with both hands. What can you do? You little brat, dare you disable both my hands?"</p><p>Chen Fanglin had been a soldier, even if just in the militia, and his courage was far greater than that of an ordinary person. Even at this critical moment, he still showed some backbone.</p><p>"Both hands....."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sighed, his breath warm against Chen Fanglin's face.</p><p>"Ahh...... Zhu Tianlei, you bastard, you really dare to break my hands......"</p><p>Chen Fanglin screamed in pain.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei grabbed both of Chen Fanglin's wrists and pulled hard. He heard a crisp snap, sharper than the nightingale's song.</p><p>Chen Fanglin, this is the interest I’m getting from you messing with my woman.”</p><p>Interest?</p><p>Chen Fanglin stared at Zhu Tianlei with a deathly pale face. This was just the interest—what was he planning to do? Was he going to kill him?</p><p>“Don’t worry; I won’t go to jail for someone like you, but since you were once the head of a militia, you should know that there are too many ways in this world to make life worse than death. For example...”</p><p>Zhu Tianlei finished his sentence as a silver needle flashed in his hand. Chen Fanglin suddenly felt his recently broken wrist burning intensely, as if millions of ants were simultaneously biting at the broken bones and tendons.</p><p>“No one will notice that your wrist is broken, nor will anyone be able to treat it, but that’s not the most important thing. What matters most is...”</p><p>Zhu Tianlei began to speak again, but Chen Fanglin was already a startled bird. A single look from Zhu Tianlei could make him too terrified to even breathe.</p><p>He was helpless to stop it and could only watch in horror as Zhu Tianlei brought the silver needle down once more.</p><p>A cold sensation swept over him, and Chen Fanglin couldn’t help letting out a sigh of relief. However, the pleasure was fleeting; his manhood seemed to be rebelling against him, swelling and burning uncontrollably, desperately seeking release.</p><p>But he terrifyingly realized that he could no longer move from the waist down.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei retracted the silver needle and coldly stared at Chen Fanglin, who had collapsed on the ground.</p><p>“Chen Fanglin, from now on, if you dare to look at Yun Tao even once more, I will make sure you spend the rest of your life in this agony, worse than death!”</p><p>With that said, Zhu Tianlei picked up Zhang Yuntao lying on the bed and leaped out the window as before. In a flash, he disappeared into the night.</p><p>Chen Fanglin sat on the ground, waiting for his body to calm down. Only then did he realize how close to death he had been.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was not human but a killing god with power over life and death. If he wanted someone dead, it would happen in an instant; if he wanted someone’s life worse than death, a silver needle would suffice.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei carried Zhang Yuntao and rushed through the night.</p><p>Chen Fanglin, you’ve messed with my woman—this is just the interest I’m collecting from you.”</p><p>Interest?</p><p>Chen Fanglin glared at Zhu Tianlei with a ghastly pale face. This was just the beginning—the question was, what was he planning? Was he going to kill him?</p><p>“Don’t worry; I won’t go to prison for someone like you. However, since you were once the head of a militia, you should know that there are countless ways in this world to make life worse than death. For example...”</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei spoke, a silver needle flashed in his hand. Chen Fanglin suddenly felt intense pain in his recently broken wrist, as if millions of ants were biting at the broken bones and tendons.</p><p>“No one will notice your broken wrist, let alone be able to treat it. But what matters most is...”</p><p>Zhu Tianlei started speaking again, but Chen Fanglin was already a terrified bird. A mere glance from Zhu Tianlei could make him too afraid to even breathe.</p><p>He couldn’t stop it and could only watch in horror as Zhu Tianlei brought the silver needle down once more.</p><p>A cold sensation washed over him, and Chen Fanglin let out a sigh of relief. However, the pleasure was short-lived; his manhood seemed to be rebelling against him, swelling and burning uncontrollably, desperately seeking release.</p><p>But he was terrified to realize that he could no longer move from the waist down.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei retracted the silver needle and coldly stared at Chen Fanglin, who had collapsed on the ground.</p><p>“Chen Fanglin, from now on, if you dare look at Yun Tao again, I will make sure you spend the rest of your life in this agony, worse than death!”</p><p>With that said, Zhu Tianlei picked up Zhang Yuntao lying on the bed and leaped out the window as before.

If he wanted someone dead, it would happen in an instant; if he wanted someone’s life worse than death, a silver needle would suffice.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei carried Zhang Yuntao and rushed through the night.</p><p>Chen Fanglin, you’ve dared to touch my woman—this is just the interest I’m reaping from you.”</p><p>Interest?</p><p>Chen Fanglin stared at Zhu Tianlei with a deathly pale face. This was merely the tip of the iceberg—what else did he have in store? Was he planning to kill him?</p><p>“Don’t worry; I wouldn’t go to prison for someone like you, but since you were once the head of a militia, you should know that there are countless ways in this world to make life worse than death. For example...”</p><p>As Zhu Tianlei spoke, a silver needle flashed in his hand. Chen Fanglin suddenly felt intense pain in his recently broken wrist, as if millions of ants were biting at the broken bones and tendons.</p><p>“No one will notice that your wrist is broken, let alone be able to treat it. But what truly matters is...”</p><p>Zhu Tianlei started speaking again, but Chen Fanglin was already a terrified bird. A mere glance from Zhu Tianlei could make him too afraid to even breathe.</p><p>He couldn’t stop it and could only watch in horror as Zhu Tianlei brought the silver needle down once more.</p><p>A cold sensation washed over him, and Chen Fanglin let out a sigh of relief. However, the pleasure was short-lived; his manhood seemed to be rebelling against him, swelling and burning uncontrollably, desperately seeking release.</p><p>But he realized with horror that he could no longer move from the waist down.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei retracted the silver needle and coldly stared at Chen Fanglin, who had collapsed on the ground.</p><p>“Chen Fanglin, from now on, if you dare to look at Yun Tao even once more, I will ensure that you spend the rest of your life in this agony, worse than death!”</p><p>With those words, Zhu Tianlei picked up Zhang Yuntao lying on the bed and leaped out the window as before. In a flash, he disappeared into the night.</p><p>Chen Fanglin sat on the ground, waiting for his body to calm down. Only then did he realize how close to death he had been.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was not human but a killing god with power over life and death. If he wanted someone dead, it would happen in an instant; if he wanted someone’s life worse than death, a silver needle would suffice.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei carried Zhang Yuntao and rushed through the night.</p><p>The night breeze swept through, lifting Zhang Yuntao's hair strands, teasingly. </p><p>Suddenly, the woman nestled in Zhu Tianlei's arms let out a soft sigh. Zhu Tianlei only then realized that Zhang Yuntao's body temperature was alarmingly high; her cheeks were flushed with an unnatural hue. Under the moonlight, her lips were vividly red, and her small hands were forcefully tugging at his collar.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt a jolt in his head.</p><p>What is Zhang Yuntao...</p><p>"Old baldy, beast!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei could not help but curse bitterly, regretting that he should not have shown mercy just now.</p><p>"Yuntao, wake up! It's me, Tianlei!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei freed one hand to gently pat Zhang Yuntao's face, trying to rouse her from her state of unconsciousness.</p><p>"Tianlei.....Tianlei...... I'm so hot, burning up, I......"</p><p>Zhang Yuntao opened her eyes, but her phoenix-like eyes were filled with dizziness. She looked at Zhu Tianlei through a veil of water vapor, casting seductive glances and speaking in a voice like a spring song.</p><p>"I know, Yuntao, try to wake up! We're almost there!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei held Zhang Yuntao close; her subtle fragrance, the restless writhing of her delicate body in his arms, and her scorching temperature, as hot as a blazing flame, were all tormenting and testing Zhu Tianlei's resolve.</p><p>"So hot..... I'm so hot......"</p>

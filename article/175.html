						<p>Xue Ping graduated from a medical university with a specialization in clinical medicine, primarily studying basic clinical skills and the ability to handle emergency, difficult, and severe cases. Xue Ping's graduation research topic was the study and prevention of infectious diseases.</p><p>Shen Haifeng graduated from a traditional Chinese medicine university and is highly proficient in various aspects of traditional Chinese medicine, including herbal medicine. Therefore, he is extremely familiar with the herbs on Zhu Tianlei's prescription.</p><p>Their arrival undoubtedly strengthened Zhu Tianlei's support team.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, this prescription is very well-formulated, but one thing to note is that the medications listed are mainly targeted at curing illnesses rather than preventing new viruses. Any virus has the potential to mutate."</p><p>Xue Ping expressed her opinion, and Zhu Tianlei nodded in agreement, finding Xue Ping's point very reasonable.</p><p>"I think we should add a few more herbs. According to the progression of infectious diseases, symptoms usually worsen over time. In this recent outbreak, patients first exhibited fatigue, convulsions, and fainting before gradually developing high fever and organ dysfunction. Therefore, I believe we should add antipyretic and anti-inflammatory medications to our current regimen, in larger doses."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked approvingly at Shen Haifeng, who was a standout among the young doctors he had encountered.</p><p>"Good, both of your suggestions are excellent, but there's still one thing... Forget it, let's both go see the patient in person!"</p><p>After some thought, Zhu Tianlei led them to Kong Shengbin's room.</p><p>Kong Shengbin lay pale on the bed, but upon seeing Doctor Zhu enter, he struggled to sit up with support from his bed, beaming a smile.</p><p>"Little Zhu, I feel much better!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt a warm current in his heart.</p><p>Kong Shengbin was a very kind and strong person. Since opening his eyes, he had remained gentle and composed, actively cooperating with treatment. At crucial moments, he even offered valuable opinions and suggestions to Doctor Zhu.</p><p>Whenever Zhu Tianlei felt lost, exhausted, or disappointed, Kong Shengbin would continually provide encouragement. As a patient, he was more positive than Zhu Tianlei, the attending physician.</p><p>"Brother Kong, you don't need to comfort me!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but smile bitterly.</p><p>"Really, my chest didn't hurt at all today. These two are......"</p><p>"Oh, let me introduce you. They are both doctors from the city's emergency center. She is Xue Ping, and he is Shen Haifeng, medical volunteers supporting our isolation ward."</p><p>Kong Shengbin seemed very excited.</p><p>"Great, great! The young doctors of today have a higher awareness; the future of our country is bright!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei found it somewhat amusing. Kong Shengbin appeared overly concerned about the nation's well-being, as if he was more excited and happy than winning the lottery at the mention of the country's future.</p><p>"Sister Xue, Haifeng, Brother Kong was the first patient to fall ill."</p><p>Seeing the jovial Kong Shengbin before them, Xue Ping and Shen Haifeng were quite surprised. A person living in an isolation ward, who could die every day, was actually able to laugh so calmly. Truly......</p><p>Under Zhu Tianlei's explanation, Xue Ping and Shen Haifeng re-examined Kong Shengbin's body. When asked about the effects of the medicine Zhu Tianlei had prescribed, Kong Shengbin provided his opinion, which was not only fair but also hit the nail on the head.</p><p>After coming out of the ward, the three of them went back into the drug research lab. Once inside, they stayed until dusk, emerging from the room looking exhausted.</p><p>"I hope this works!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the pill in his hand, his expression serious as he silently hoped.</p><p>Kong Shengbin once again enthusiastically volunteered to be a guinea pig.</p><p>This time, not only Zhu Tianlei and Xue Ping, Shen Haifeng, but almost half of the medical staff in the isolation ward crowded outside the ward door.</p><p>They had been staying in the isolation ward for a week. What should have passed quickly felt endless. They could only call their families, and their longing and fear wore them down, so their eagerness for the new drug to be successful was no less than anyone else's.</p><p>After taking the pill, Kong Shengbin lay on the bed, his pale face matching the snowy white sheets of the hospital bed.</p><p>Time passed slowly. The large corridor was silent as a grave.</p><p>Although everyone knew that even if the medicine worked, it would absolutely not take effect in such a short time, no one was willing to leave, unwilling to miss this exciting moment. </p><p>The moon was at its zenith.</p><p>Moonlight silently fell into the ward, and the onlookers gradually dispersed. Only Zhu Tianlei, Xue Ping, Shen Haifeng, and Li Yong remained seated in the ward, without even changing their postures.</p><p>"Mmm..."</p><p>Suddenly, Kong Shengbin twitched on the bed and then sat up abruptly, spitting out a mouthful of blackish-brown pus.</p><p>The pus was like blooming mandrakes, stinging Zhu Tianlei's eyes.</p><p>Their faces simultaneously turned ugly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei walked over, steadying Kong Shengbin with one hand and placing his fingers on the other man's pulse. His heart tightened.</p><p>Kong Shengbin's pulse was weak, intermittent like spring drizzle.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei felt a pain in his chest, wishing he could punch through the concrete wall opposite him.</p><p>But he knew that he couldn't be reckless, so he suppressed all his emotions and instead poured his inner spirit energy into Kong Shengbin's body. This frenzied, unrestrained infusion made Zhu Tianlei's face turn crimson.</p><p>The people nearby were startled; they had dealt with Zhu Tianlei many times before—the man who remained calm in any emergency—should not look like this.</p><p>However, the atmosphere in the room was too oppressive, so suffocating that it was unbearable. The aura emanating from Zhu Tianlei made everyone dare not approach him. Therefore, though all three were extremely worried, none dared to go over.</p><p>In his frenzy, Zhu Tianlei had only one belief: Kong Shengbin could not die, even if he had to sacrifice himself and infuse all his spirit energy into Kong Shengbin.</p><p>Suddenly, Zhu Tianlei felt as if a gash had been opened in Kong Shengbin's body. This gash was like a wide mouth, continuously sucking in the spirit energy from Zhu Tianlei's body.</p><p>This discovery made Zhu Tianlei ecstatic, for he had previously been unable to infuse any of his spirit energy into Kong Shengbin's body.</p><p>As the spiritual energy flowed in, Kong Shengbin's complexion gradually improved. Soon, his breathing stabilized, and Zhu Tianlei finally heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Kong Shengbin wasn't going to die!</p><p>Moreover, this change indicated something—that the drug they had developed was effective, although not to the point of curing him. At least it worked, which made this the happiest moment for Zhu Tianlei since entering the quarantine zone.</p>

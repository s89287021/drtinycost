						<p>Zhu Tianlei glanced at the worker standing still without moving, a strange feeling rising in his heart. However, he only took a quick look before pulling Mao Yu and following the man upstairs.</p><p>Yuan Zhen stood still, watching the few people leave with reverence in his eyes that never wavered from beginning to end.</p><p>Although the man was using crutches, he walked very steadily. Mao Yu grabbed Zhu Tianlei's arm and communicated something through her gaze, but Zhu Tianlei shook his head.</p><p>He found this man quite intriguing.</p><p>The staircase wasn't long, yet it took the man exactly two minutes to climb it.</p><p>Upon reaching the top of the stairs, Zhu Tianlei saw a huge room. On one side, there were many boxes stacked up, and the outer packaging of these boxes was identical to that of Qingdan Pills produced by Tianlei Pharmaceutical, making it impossible to distinguish them from genuine ones at all.</p><p>"Can't you tell?"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei examining the cardboard boxes, the man asked casually, as if he was talking about the weather.</p><p>"Yes, I can't tell."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei replied seriously.</p><p>The conversation between the two people left Mao Yu standing beside them completely confused, but this time she didn't interrupt or make any sudden movements.</p><p>"Please sit down. My health isn't good, and I rarely drink tea; only plain water. Please don't take offense!"</p><p>Below the window was a set of light gray modular sofas, with a tea table opposite it. Although the man said he didn't drink tea, the tea table seemed absurdly large.</p><p>Although Zhu Tianlei had just finished drinking tea not long ago, he still knew something about tea tables. The one before him was made of black ebony wood, and judging from its density and luster, it was the finest grade of black ebony.</p><p>"We'll do as you please."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei took a white porcelain cup handed to him by the man without hesitation and drank a large sip.</p><p>Máoyǔ wanted to stop him but couldn't, and inwardly cursed Zhū Tiānlěi a dozen or so times. What kind of water would he dare drink? Didn’t he fear being poisoned?</p><p>"I am Zhang, with only one character Yì. I am nine years older than you. If you don’t mind, you can call me Brother Zhang. If not, calling me Mr. Zhang is fine too."</p><p>The man lifted his porcelain cup and took a light sip, making drinking look more graceful than tea-drinking.</p><p>"Brother Zhang, nice to meet you!"</p><p>Zhū Tiānlěi did not hesitate and directly called out Brother Zhang.</p><p>Zhang Yì made no response to Zhū Tiānlěi's call of Brother Zhang but instead glanced out the window.</p><p>Zhang Yì spoke indifferently. Zhū Tiānlěi listened without showing any emotion but was inwardly shocked.</p><p>The day he was born happened to be the first snowfall of winter. His mother told him that countless sparrows flew into Heihǔlín that day, coming from who knew where. When he was eight, his father's leg was broken by a stone, though he survived, it left him disabled, making life extraordinarily difficult.</p><p>"However, six months ago, your celestial stars stirred, the star of red happiness descended upon you, giving you an extraordinary chance to change your fate, leading to great wealth and a profound marital bond."</p><p>After Zhang Yì finished speaking, water spilled from Zhū Tiānlěi's teacup.</p><p>Who was this Zhang Yì? If what he had said earlier was shocking, it was still within the realm of acceptability. Those with intent could investigate those things, though difficult, not impossible. However, what he said later couldn’t be easily probed.</p><p>"You are Zhū Tiānlěi, Chairman of Zhū Tiānlěi Pharmaceutical."</p><p>Zhang Yì turned his head to look at Zhū Tiānlěi and casually stated.</p><p>Máoyǔ was startled.</p><p>Did this man know their identities earlier? Was he setting a trap for them?</p><p>Zhang Daoge's skills truly deserve my admiration. I am Zhu Tianlei. Given this, let's speak plainly. I came here to find out who is impersonating Tianlei Pharmaceutical and producing fake Qingdan.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei knew that Zhang Yi was a master. Facing such a person, he had no need for circumlocution.</p><p>"Have you seen our Qingdan?"</p><p>Instead of responding to Zhu Tianlei, Zhang Yi looked at him intently and asked sincerely,</p><p>"Yes, it is identical to the Qingdan produced by Tianlei Pharmaceutical!"</p><p>"Why can't I continue producing and selling it then?"</p><p>As soon as Zhang Yi finished speaking, Mao Yu could not sit still anymore.</p><p>Is this person too shameless?</p><p>"Hey, how could you even ask such a question? Qingdan has been patented by Tianlei Pharmaceutical. Producing fake products infringes on the patent rights, which is illegal. Now that they have been caught red-handed, they still have the audacity to say such things. Isn't your face too thick?"</p><p>Mao Yu was truly furious, but Zhang Yi's expression did not change in the slightest when faced with Mao Yu's accusation.</p><p>"Is there something wrong with your legs?"</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, what is going on? He now openly wants to seize our brand and use fake goods to monopolize our market. How can you still be concerned about his legs?"</p><p>Seeing that Zhu Tianlei not only did not get angry but instead turned to concern Zhang Yi's legs, Mao Yu became even more furious.</p><p>"Yes, I was born with it. I have gotten used to it!"</p><p>Zhang Yi casually glanced at his own legs.</p><p>"I can cure your legs."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at Zhang Yi and said, "I would rather you agreed to continue producing Qingdan."</p><p>Zhang Yi tugged at the corner of his mouth and smiled faintly.</p><p>This man's smile was too devastating. Just a moment ago, Maoyu's feathers were smoking with anger, but upon seeing the smile on Zhang Yi's face, all his rage dissipated instantly. Moreover, for some reason, his heart began to pound rapidly.</p><p>"It's not about that. Besides, I need to meet your boss."</p><p>Maoyu gave Zhu Tianlei a strange look. Wasn't this Zhang Yi their boss? Who else did he want to see?</p><p>"He doesn't easily meet people."</p><p>"You will make him see me."</p><p>"Alright, then I'll try!"</p><p>The two seemed to be communicating in riddles; Maoyu didn't know that Zhu Tianlei had this side to him. He was so enigmatic and different from the Zhu Tianlei who usually acted pretentiously and caused trouble as if it were a daily routine.</p><p>Zhang Yi stood up, swaying slightly as he did. Maoyu jumped in surprise, but Zhu Tianlei seemed not to have noticed.</p><p>People like Zhang Yi were proud and considered ignoring them a sign of respect.</p><p>After Zhang Yi left, Maoyu grabbed Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, are you crazy? Do you lack common sense?"</p><p>"Oh, our returned goddess is now speaking with such a rustic accent!"</p><p>"Pah, stop interrupting me. If you agree to him, I'll..."</p><p>"What are you like?"</p><p>Máo Yǔ actually experienced a moment of speechlessness, and for some reason, Zhang Yi's smiling face involuntarily appeared in his mind.</p><p>The atmosphere became somewhat awkward at that moment. Just then, Zhang Yi returned.</p>

						<p>Behind Wu Pingjian, a gray-haired old man slowly walked out with a smile on his face. His gaze at Zhu Tianlei was nothing but admiration.</p><p>This old man was none other than Ma Lao, whom Zhu Tianlei had treated in the car.</p><p>"Ah, Wen Hao, this is the young man who saved my life!"</p><p>Ma Lao said to Yang Wenhao, the Secretary of Yunhai City's Party Committee, standing beside him as he looked at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"This young man has superb medical skills and a generous heart. He is truly rare to find!"</p><p>Yang Wenhao had been observing Zhu Tianlei all along. Even without Ma Lao's words, he was already quite impressed by Zhu Tianlei. Despite his youth, Zhu was neither arrogant nor impulsive, and did not misuse his abilities. Most importantly, in a situation where he was right, Zhu could forgive and be lenient to others. Such young people were indeed rare nowadays!</p><p>"Pingjian, I'm taking him away. You and Zhang Gu should handle the rest here!"</p><p>After saying that, Yang Wenhao waved at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei held Hao Xinmei's hand and pulled her out of the compartment together.</p><p>When they passed by Zhao Zhiguo, Zhu Tianlei stopped.</p><p>"Doctor Zhao, your white coat looks really sharp!"</p><p>Saying this, Zhu Tianlei lightly adjusted the collar of Zhao Zhiguo's white coat. Zhao Zhiguo froze in place, even forgetting to breathe.</p><p>Sun Jiang had been stunned by a series of unexpected events and immediately shuddered like he saw a ghost when he saw Zhu Tianlei looking at him.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled but said nothing more as he pulled Hao Xinmei and left the door of Liyuan Chun in large strides.</p><p>Having come to Yunhai City for thirty-one years, this humiliation was unprecedented for him. This grudge, he, Sun Jianguo, would not let it go, heaven be damned!</p><p>"Hey, you're Zhu Tianlei, right?"</p><p>Outside the door, Yang Wenhao spoke first.</p><p>"As Secretary Yang said, I am indeed called Zhu Tianlei."</p><p>"Are you a doctor?"</p><p>"No, I'm just an ordinary villager from Halamou Gou."</p><p>"Oh, where did you learn your medical skills?"</p><p>"I taught myself."</p><p>After a few simple exchanges, Yang Wenhao's admiration for Zhu Tianlei had already sunk in.</p><p>"Old Ma, Zhu Tianlei is quite the talent. You truly have excellent discernment; your judgment of people and matters is astonishing, and I feel rather inadequate!"</p><p>"Haha, you, the big leader of Yunhai City, saying such things won't you be laughed at?"</p><p>Old Ma chuckled, although he spoke this way, there was not a trace of humility on his face.</p><p>Hao Xinmei watched the scene before her, secretly amazed.</p><p>She already knew that Zhu Tianlei had called the phone number of an old man standing in front of him, instead of Mayor Wu. This old man's identity was such that it made the Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Yunhai City so respectful.</p><p>"Tianlei, we really have a connection, how about following me around?"</p><p>Old Ma looked at Zhu Tianlei with a loving tone, as if he were speaking to his own descendant.</p><p>"Yes, Tianlei, accompany Old Man Ma on a trip. Old Man Ma rarely has such refined interests!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was just about to open his mouth to refuse when he felt his hand being pulled by another. Turning around, he saw Hao Xinmei shaking her head gently at him.</p><p>"Hehe, Mr. Ma, Secretary Yang, sorry, I’m currently shopping with my girlfriend, this is a rare opportunity for me, so please fulfill my wish!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei’s face turned red as if it would burst out of her skin, and she glared fiercely at Zhu Tianlei. Did Zhu Tianlei really lie without even blinking his eyes? Most importantly, didn’t he realize that the two people in front of him were extraordinary?</p><p>"Mr. Ma, Secretary Yang, don’t believe Tianlei’s lies, I’m not him......"</p><p>Hao Xinmei was about to explain when she was interrupted by Mr. Ma’s laughter.</p><p>"Haha, young people should understand each other; I’ve been young too, Wen Hao, let’s not force this man!"</p><p>"Yes yes, please humor me and let me accompany you on your shopping trip!"</p><p>Yang Wenhao also joined in with a hearty laugh. Zhu Tianlei felt a bit touched; this was how someone in a high position should behave.</p><p>"Oh right, Tianlei, here is my office number as well as my mobile phone number, if you have anything to discuss just call me directly!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei stared blankly at the backs of Mr. Ma and Secretary Yang as they left briskly, then looked down at the note in Zhu Tianlei’s hand. The phone number on it was something many people in Yunchaicheng would kill for.</p><p>"Hehe, Xiao Mei, are you mesmerized? I know I’m good-looking, but this is still a street; be careful not to draw unwanted attention!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei withdrew her gaze and looked at Zhu Tianlei with an expression that made him want to punch him. She was truly helpless between laughter and tears.</p><p>"Good-looking? Like crickets?"</p><p>Realizing the situation was resolved, Hao Xinmei’s heart settled down. Although she didn’t say a single word of kindness, Zhu Tianlei could sense a change in her attitude towards him.</p><p>The Long March has begun, and I’ve successfully taken my first step! Ha!</p><p>"Oh right, Xiao Mei, how did you know about me?"</p><p>Two people wandered down the street for a while before finding a café to sit in. Zhu Tianlei didn't enjoy coffee, finding it bitter, so he put down his cup and began chatting with Hao Xinmei again.</p><p>"I heard from Liu Yong."</p><p>Liu Yong?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei thought the name sounded familiar, then suddenly clapped his hands.</p><p>"Are you talking about Dr. Liu Yong of the municipal hospital?"</p><p>"Yes, he is a renowned professor in the internal medicine department at the municipal hospital; you should have met him."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei had a good impression of Liu Yong; although both were doctors, Liu Yong and Zhao Zhiguo were complete opposites.</p><p>"What's your connection with Liu Yong?"</p><p>Hao Xinmei glared at Zhu Tianlei, as if they didn't share any connections. Why was this Zhu Tianlei investigating the men in her life from their first meeting?</p><p>"We used to be orphans together."</p><p>Although she wasn't pleased, Hao Xinmei explained.</p><p>"Ximei, you will never be alone again, and no one will bully you. No matter what happens, remember, I am always behind you."</p><p>Hao Xinmei's hand was suddenly grabbed by Zhu Tianlei. The man's broad and warm palm caressed her delicate fingers, which were as smooth as porcelain. Hao Xinmei's eyes once again filled with tears.</p><p>In one day, she had cried twice because of this man's words.</p><p>A thousand words, a myriad of words; in the business world, this strong-willed woman who spoke sharply and held her ground was at a loss for words at this moment, finally only nodding her head.</p><p>"Okay!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei grinned widely, laughing like a child.</p><p>The midday sunlight filtered through the coffee shop window, casting dappled shadows on Zhu Tianlei's face. In this moment, in Hao Xinhui's eyes, he was neither the skilled village doctor nor the hero who had gone through battles unscathed; he was simply a man—honest and warm—a man who moved her heart and brought her peace.</p>

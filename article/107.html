						<p>Lying in bed, Niu Amei slowly opened her eyes and stared at Zhu Tianlei's face for a moment, then suddenly hugged his neck tightly.</p><p>"Son, my son, don't leave your mother..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was startled. What was going on? Was she delirious?</p><p>"Grandma, I'm not your son, you've got the wrong person; I'm Zhu Tianlei!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said softly, not expecting that Niu's old lady not only didn't let go but started crying loudly.</p><p>"Foolish son, do you want to take my life? Who else could it be if not my son? I carried you for nine months and gave birth to you; how could I get you wrong?"</p><p>This situation indeed surprised Zhu Tianlei, but the old lady had just woken up and was still very weak. He dared not push her away forcefully.</p><p>"Grandma, since you've just woken up, let me help you lie down for a while!"</p><p>"I won't lie down, I want to go home, go home!"</p><p>Niu's old lady had great strength; she squeezed Zhu Tianlei tightly with both arms, making it hard for him to breathe.</p><p>"Alright, alright, Mother, please release me first, my neck hurts."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei lowered his voice and spoke gently as if soothing a child.</p><p>"Neck hurts? Son, where does it hurt, here? Let me soothe you, shh, it won't hurt anymore!"</p><p>When Niu's old lady heard Zhu Tianlei's words, she immediately released him, then looked at his neck with a full face of concern and gently blew on it, whispering "Good boy, don't hurt."</p><p>"Mother is so good, son also feels sorry for Mother, please lie down and rest for a while!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei supported Niu's old lady's shoulder, moving softly and speaking tenderly. This time, the old lady cooperated very well, lying down on the bed gently and not forgetting to hold Zhu Tianlei's hand.</p><p>This heartwarming scene made the doctors in the ward feel ashamed. Treating patients and saving lives reflect a doctor's skill level, but being so meticulous with patients is something not everyone can do.</p><p>Standing at the door of the emergency room, Mao Yu's eyes were slightly moistened. Her mother suffered from moderate schizophrenia. In her childhood memories, her mother was nothing more than a patient, and she hardly experienced the warmth of maternal love. She had never been as gentle towards her mother as Zhu Tianlei was.</p><p>In senior high school, she applied for a full scholarship to a university in the United States on her own. As soon as the college entrance examination ended, she flew directly to America, escaping from her family and her ill mother. It wasn't until three years ago when her mother passed away that she suddenly realized how much she longed for maternal love. However, once a person is dead, they cannot be revived, and all her warmth and guilt had nowhere to go.</p><p>So the Zhu Tianlei before her awakened the thoughts buried in her heart for three years.</p><p>Under Zhu Tianlei's persuasion, Old Madam Niu slowly closed her eyes and fell asleep.</p><p>Only then did Zhu Tianlei breathe a sigh of relief. In just a moment, his front and back were already soaked with sweat.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, your kindness and skills are truly our model to follow!"</p><p>"Let's go outside and talk."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei lowered his voice and glanced at Old Madam Niu, who was already emitting faint snores.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, your medical skills are unparalleled, truly unmatched in history!"</p><p>Outside the door, Li Ping could no longer suppress his emotions, blurting out every word of praise. Even so, he felt it still couldn't fully express his feelings.</p><p>"Director Li, you no longer call me an unlicensed practitioner?"</p><p>"Hehe, that was all a misunderstanding, all a misunderstanding..."</p><p>Li Ping, teased by Zhu Tianlei, showed no anger and chuckled twice.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei suddenly became serious.</p><p>"Director Li, this patient seems to have a mental disorder. Could you please ask the doctors and nurses responsible for treatment and care to be more patient? The elderly lady's previous fainting was due to myocardial infarction caused by emotional stimulation, and she simply cannot withstand any more stimuli."</p><p>Li Ping nodded solemnly and beckoned the doctor who had participated in the rescue operation.</p><p>"This patient must be carefully taken care of. Be as patient as possible, do you understand?"</p><p>Li Ping did not doubt Zhu Tianlei's words and almost repeated them verbatim.</p><p>"Director Li, this elderly lady fainted on the way here, and we haven't found her family members yet. We don't even have a place for rescue fees! You know the hospital's regulations; it's probably quite difficult to handle!"</p><p>The doctor's words made Li Ping frown as well. The hospital did indeed have such regulations—medical staff could not admit patients without authorization, and admitting patients without a family member's signature or relevant institutional seal would violate hospital rules, leading to disciplinary action or even dismissal. This applied equally to department heads.</p><p>Seeing Li Ping's dilemma, Zhu Tianlei immediately understood.</p><p>"Director Li, I will cover this patient's emergency medical expenses and other costs. I'll handle all necessary procedures, so you can arrange for admission normally!"</p><p>Li Ping and the other medical staff looked at Zhu Tianlei in disbelief.</p><p>In today's society, everyone avoids such matters like the plague, hoping to stay as far away as possible. How could someone volunteer to take on these responsibilities?</p><p>Providing assistance was one thing, but bearing costs and responsibilities was another.</p><p>"Director Li, go ahead with your arrangements. I have other things to do; I'll be going up now. If anything comes up, just call me directly!"</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei took out a newly printed business card and placed it in Li Ping's hand before leaving quickly, heading towards the second floor where Zhang Qiang was being treated.</p><p>Mao Yu had already stood at the door of the ward. Upon seeing Zhu Tianlei, his face turned slightly red.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei did not feel anything about it; he understood Mao Yu's emotional agitation after what just happened. Mao Yu was looking out for him, and as a man, he couldn't be too petty.</p><p>"Mr. Mao, why are you standing at the door?"</p><p>Mao Yu looked at Zhu Tianlei and her rosy lips moved slightly.</p><p>"Tianlei, I'm sorry, my attitude was bad just now."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback; he didn't expect Mao Yu to apologize to him. This was truly unprecedented!</p><p>However, before Zhu Tianlei could respond, Mao Yu entered the ward.</p><p>In the ward, besides medical staff, there were also Captain Qi and the doctor named Yang from earlier.</p><p>"Captain Qi, what are the results of the examination?"</p><p>"Little Zhu, the results of the examination are not good!"</p><p>Qi Lian had also witnessed Zhu Tianlei revive Old Lady Niu, so his impression of Zhu Tianlei could be described as not just good but very good. He now addressed him as Little Zhu.</p><p>"Not good?"</p><p>"Yes, this worker suffers from severe malnutrition with significant loss in various bodily indicators, clearly indicative of the symptoms caused by high-pressure work."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei certainly understood what Qi Lian meant by these words, but he wasn't worried about taking responsibility at the moment. Instead, he was puzzled as to how Zhang Qiang, who was only in his early thirties, could be suffering from malnutrition and severe physical depletion.</p><p>"Mr. Mao, why are you standing at the door?"</p><p>Mao Yu looked at Zhu Tianlei, her rosy lips moving slightly.</p><p>"Tianlei, I'm sorry; my attitude was poor just now."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback; he hadn't expected Mao Yu to apologize to him. This was quite unexpected!</p><p>However, before Zhu Tianlei could respond, Mao Yu entered the ward.</p><p>In the ward, besides medical staff, there were also Captain Qi and Doctor Yang from earlier.</p><p>"Captain Qi, what are the examination results?"</p><p>"Little Zhu, the examination results are not good!"</p><p>Qi Lian had witnessed Zhu Tianlei revive Old Lady Niu, so his impression of Zhu Tianlei was excellent. He now referred to him as Little Zhu.</p><p>"Not good?"</p><p>"Yes, this worker suffers from severe malnutrition and significant loss in various bodily indicators, clearly indicating symptoms caused by high-pressure work."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei understood what Qi Lian meant but wasn't concerned about taking responsibility at the moment. Instead, he was puzzled as to how Zhang Qiang, who was only in his early thirties, could be suffering from malnutrition and severe physical depletion.</p><p>"Mr. Mao, why are you standing at the doorway?"</p><p>Mao Yu gazed at Zhu Tianlei, her delicate lips twitching slightly.</p><p>"Tianlei, I’m sorry; my demeanor was poor just now."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback by this apology from Mao Yu, finding it quite unexpected!</p><p>Before he could respond, Mao Yu entered the ward.</p><p>Inside, along with the medical staff, were Captain Qi and Doctor Yang from earlier.</p><p>"Captain Qi, what are the results of the examination?"</p><p>"Little Zhu, the examination results are not favorable!"</p><p>Qi Lian had witnessed Zhu Tianlei revive Old Lady Niu, so his impression of Zhu Tianlei was highly positive. He now addressed him as Little Zhu.</p><p>"Not favorable?"</p><p>"Yes, this worker suffers from severe malnutrition and a significant decline in various bodily indicators, clearly indicating symptoms consistent with high-pressure work."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei understood Qi Lian's meaning but was not concerned about taking responsibility at the moment. Instead, he was puzzled by how Zhang Qiang, only in his early thirties, could be suffering from such severe malnutrition and physical depletion.</p>

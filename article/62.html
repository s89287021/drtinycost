						<p>Zhu Tianlei did not feel embarrassed. Yesterday, the two of them nearly did it, and he was certainly not wearing clothes.</p><p>"You......quickly put your clothes on!"</p><p>Hao Xinhui turned her face away, unable to meet his gaze directly.</p><p>She had seen advertisements for men's underwear in magazines and men wearing swimming trunks at the pool, but none of those men had anything as impressive as Zhu Tianlei's. Thinking about what nearly happened yesterday made Hao Xinhui's heart pound so hard she felt like it would burst out of her throat.</p><p>"Sigh, little brother, you've been rejected!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei said this to the treasure in his briefs but turned around and dressed up properly.</p><p>"Alright, turn back now!"</p><p>Hao Xinhui slowly turned her head and saw that Zhu Tianlei had put on his clothes, finally breathing a sigh of relief. However, her cheeks were still flushed red.</p><p>"Hurry up and eat!"</p><p>Once inside the house, Hao Xinhui handed breakfast to Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>A hamburger, coffee.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei frowned. He really did not like these things; he preferred drinking some congee instead.</p><p>"Don't you like it?"</p><p>"Not at all, it just looks too delicious, hehe, Xinhui must care about me!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was no fool and would never speak the truth.</p><p>"This is better. Hurry up and eat!"</p><p>A meal, Zhu Tianlei ate with great discomfort. No matter how difficult it was to swallow, he had to pretend to be relishing the food and enjoying it all under Hao Xinmei’s ‘intense’ gaze.</p><p>After finishing their preparations, the two of them went to the hotel lobby to check out, only to discover that someone had already paid for their accommodation fees.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei could vaguely guess who had settled the bill.</p><p>“Where are we going now?”</p><p>“We’re going to the mall!”</p><p>Mall?</p><p>Hao Xinmei was taken aback; she hadn’t expected Zhu Tianlei to go shopping. However, she wasn’t nosy and didn’t like prying into others’ privacy. Although puzzled, she headed straight for Yinhai Jinhaian Commercial City.</p><p>Jinhaian Commercial City was the largest commercial shopping center in Yinhai City. However, Hao Xinmei was usually busy with work and rarely had time to go shopping.</p><p>“Are you buying something?”</p><p>Although it was Zhu Tianlei’s first time visiting such a large place, he didn’t show any signs of confusion or timidity. After entering, he walked straight towards the jewelry counter.</p><p>The saleswoman was a woman in her thirties with heavy makeup on, sitting at a chair behind the counter painting her nails. However, after glancing at Zhu Tianlei, she lowered her head and continued painting, her disdainful gaze unmistakable.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn’t mind, lowering his head to carefully examine the items inside the counter, his eyes focused on a white gold bracelet.</p><p>The bracelet wasn’t complicated but looked very exquisite.</p><p>“Sis, can you help me take out this bracelet for a look?”</p><p>Having chosen what he wanted, Zhu Tianlei called out to the saleswoman to fetch it, but she acted as if she hadn’t heard and continued painting her nails, a faint smell of formaldehyde wafting over.</p><p>“Sis, I want to buy this bracelet!”</p><p>Zhu Tianlei thought the other person hadn't heard him and shouted again. This time, the salesperson finally lifted her head, but there was no sign of her coming over.</p><p>"You look at the price first!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face changed, and he instantly understood why the salesperson had this attitude; it wasn't that she didn't hear him, but rather that she thought he couldn't afford it.</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>No man could endure such humiliation.</p><p>"What do I mean? Just what the words say, that necklace was designed by a master, not everyone can afford it!"</p><p>This time, the salesperson made her point even clearer. Zhu Tianlei clenched his fists, veins bulging on his forearms, just about to speak.</p><p>"I'll buy this necklace!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei, who had just parked and entered the mall, saw this scene immediately. She felt heartbroken and blurted out without thinking.</p><p>"Alright alright, I'll process the invoice right away. Miss has great taste; this necklace was designed by a famous foreign designer. Miss has good temperament; such a necklace would match Miss perfectly!"</p><p>Seeing Hao Xinmei in designer clothes, the salesperson's attitude did an about-face of 180 degrees. Her mouth opened wide, and even her eyes crinkled with laughter. At the same time, she couldn't help but give Zhu Tianlei a look.</p><p>"Miss, swipe your card here!"</p><p>"Do you know this person?"</p><p>The salesperson was stunned and didn't understand Hao Xinmei's meaning.</p><p>Then she saw Hao Xinmei place her phone in front of her. On the WeChat interface was an avatar of a woman hugging a cat; this avatar was very familiar to the salesperson, it was none other than their jewelry company's general manager Su Wenshan.</p><p>"Wenshan, your store's sales training isn't doing too well, is it? My boyfriend fell in love with a necklace in your store, and the salesperson barely responded. I'm not happy about this at all!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei pressed the voice call button.</p><p>"What? You have a boyfriend now? Who is he? Let me see him quickly!"</p><p>Soon, the voice resumed.</p><p>Right after that came the sound of a video call request. The salesperson stood dumbfounded behind the counter holding the receipt.</p><p>On the other end of the video call, a young woman appeared on camera with bright eyes and white teeth, short hair reaching her ears.</p><p>"Oh wow, handsome! Xiao Mei, you're amazing, getting yourself ready to get married without telling me, how could you not inform me? That's no good, you should be punished!"</p><p>"Okay, okay, I accept my punishment. Take me out for a big dinner later!"</p><p>Su Wenshan was Hao Xinmei's best friend, something the salesperson had absolutely never imagined, and even less expected that the man in plain clothes would turn out to be the boyfriend of this woman with impeccable appearance and looks.</p><p>"The personnel department will contact you this afternoon. Get ready for your work transfer!"</p><p>Su Wenshan glanced at the dumbfounded salesperson behind the counter, her face immediately turning serious.</p><p>She knew her best friend very well, and if Hao Xinmei had brought up the matter, it must have been unbearable.</p><p>The salesperson's face turned pale, but she could not utter a word.</p><p>"Tianlei, cheer up!"</p><p>After leaving the jewelry counter, Zhu Tianlei's expression remained gloomy. Hao Xinmei simply pulled Zhu Tianlei's arm and rested her head on his shoulder in an unusual display of clinginess.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was indeed feeling downhearted!</p><p>For a man, dignity and pride sometimes mattered more than life, especially in front of his beloved woman.</p><p>"Xiao Mei, I will definitely try my best!"</p><p>"Good, I believe in you!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei's eyebrows were firmly set. She did not merely say these words to comfort Zhu Tianlei; she truly believed that he was no ordinary person, and his future would certainly be astonishing!</p><p>This little interlude quickly passed, and Zhu Tianlei bought many health supplements at the supermarket and also purchased a set of clothes for each of his parents.</p><p>"Xiao Mei, this is for you!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei went to the restroom in between. When she returned, there was a necklace in Zhu Tianlei's hand that had appeared out of nowhere. Although the necklace was not made of gold, Hao Xinmei was moved to tears.</p>

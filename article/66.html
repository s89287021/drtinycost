						<p>At the moment of passion, Zhu Tianlei gently pressed Ma Lanlan onto the nursing bed and then leaned over her. The softness beneath him made Zhu Tianlei's throat dry up repeatedly, as if a wildfire was spreading, with flames crawling all over his body. Zhu Tianlei's lips traveled downward, following the curve of her jawline, the sexy collarbone, and the continuous peaks. Every time his lips and tongue touched a spot, he heard a soft moan. Zhu Tianlei's large hand slowly undid Ma Lanlan's pristine nurse's uniform buttons, one by one. Each button was like a bomb, shattering Zhu Tianlei's rationality into pieces. The black lace trim contrasted with the pure snow-white fabric. Not only did it move Zhu Tianlei, a young man full of vigor, but even a stone would have been touched. With a light movement of his hand, the black lace parted to reveal the pure snow-white beauty, the mountain peaks standing tall, valleys deep, with peach blossoms blooming on the mountains, delicate and enchanting. Zhu Tianlei buried himself in it, appreciating both mountains without any lack and each peach blossom one by one. The mountains became more robust due to moisture, while the peach blossoms grew even more vivid from watering. "Um... Lanlan, you are so beautiful, I want you!" Zhu Tianlei's voice was hoarse as his lips continued their descent. In a ravine filled with lush grass, there lay another world within a deep gorge. The water flowed like silk, tugging at heartstrings. Zhu Tianlei submerged himself in it, his tongue sharp as a sword, plunging straight down. The gentle stream soon overflowed into a flood, the raging waters drowning the ravine. "Um... Tianlei... I feel uncomfortable..." Due to the unfamiliar sensation, the inexperienced Ma Lanlan did not know how to express herself. She wanted Zhu Tianlei to be more intense but also feared this feeling. "Good Lanlan, I know, I will be gentle!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's voice was like a tranquilizer, quickly soothing Ma Lanlan's mood. She began to awkwardly respond, drawing Fenglan and the ravines closer to Zhu Tianlei, allowing him to touch her more delicately and passionately.</p><p>"Lanlan, I'm coming in now, don't be afraid!"</p><p>This was Zhu Tianlei's first time doing this, although it was a primal instinct for humans. However, seeing his beloved woman in front of him, he could understand why he was so nervous.</p><p>"Mm!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan shyly responded with an "mm," her face blushing like peach blossoms, appearing much more alluring and enticing than usual.</p><p>"Is Tianlei there?"</p><p>F*ck you so much!</p><p>Zhu Tianlei really wanted to curse this voice's ancestors.</p><p>"Tianlei, someone is here, hurry up and get up!"</p><p>Ma Lanlan paled at the sight, worried that if anyone saw her, she would never be able to show her face again.</p><p>"It doesn't matter, the door is locked, they won't know if anyone is inside!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei secretly rejoiced that he had locked the door when he entered; otherwise, being caught on the bed by someone else would have been...</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei about to lower his head again, Ma Lanlan angrily pushed him away, but inadvertently glanced at his private area. Her face instantly turned red as if it could drip blood.</p><p>He was so big there!</p><p>Noticing Ma Lanlan getting up and quickly straightening her clothes, Zhu Tianlei knew that there was no chance anymore!</p><p>Could this be a test from heaven?</p><p>"That's not being too much, is it? How many times has this happened? Every time it feels like an arrow ready to be released."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei wore a disgruntled look of frustration. Ma Lanlan knew what such things meant for men. After smoothing out her clothes, she looked at Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Alright, I'll find a way to make it up to you!"</p><p>Although Ma Lanlan's voice was soft, Zhu Tianlei heard it clearly.</p><p>"How will you make it up to me?"</p><p>"You...you decide!"</p><p>With Ma Lanlan's promise, Zhu Tianlei felt relieved.</p><p>"I'm going to the back storeroom first. It wouldn't be good if anyone saw us!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei nodded. Ma Lanlan was very considerate; with both of them in the room and the door locked for so long, people would naturally start to wonder.</p><p>Only after Ma Lanlan's figure disappeared through the back door did Zhu Tianlei step out from behind the curtain, a sinister fire burning within him.</p><p>Peering through the glass, he found that the person outside was far beyond his expectations.</p><p>It wasn't someone else; it was Min Shengjun.</p><p>How could he be here?</p><p>"Mr. Min, why are you here?"</p><p>To be honest, although it was Min Shengjun, Zhu Tianlei still felt upset, though his expression was somewhat acceptable.</p><p>"I came to take a look and personally apologize to those villagers. After all, it's Shengshi Group's fault, and I can't let the villagers suffer unjustly!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's heart stirred. He didn't expect Min Shengjun to actually come; previously, at the Shengshi Group, he thought the other party was just saying pleasantries.</p><p>"Tianlei, did you think that Uncle Min and I were just talking and wouldn't really come?"</p><p>Jiang remained shrewd as ever; it was no wonder he had been navigating business for decades. He saw right through Zhu Tianlei's thoughts with a single glance.</p><p>"Uncle Min has sharp eyes, I really thought so too!"</p><p>"Haha, you're quite honest, Uncle Min approves of that! So, will you accompany Uncle Min?"</p><p>"Yes, since Uncle Min said so, Tianlei will definitely join!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei deliberately spoke loudly; the grocery store and clinic were separated by just a door. By saying this, Ma Lanlan would surely hear it.</p><p>Their first stop was at Hu Zi's house.</p><p>To the Liu Suer family, Zhu Tianlei was a benefactor and a lucky charm. The entire household, young and old, came out to welcome him as soon as he stepped into the yard.</p><p>Regarding the cause of the illness, only Village Head Yao Gang knew the truth; Zhu Tianlei didn't intend to reveal it either. He simply said that Min Shengjun had previously been stationed in Huangtacun village and had now become successful. Upon hearing that the villagers in Huangtacun were ill, he came over to visit.</p><p>Rural people are generally honest, and since the person was brought by Zhu Tianlei, the Liu Suer family naturally welcomed them warmly.</p><p>As they were about to leave, Min Shengjun insisted on giving Hu Zi a red envelope, saying it was for nourishing the child. After some reluctance, Liu Suer accepted it.</p><p>However, when the two left and Hu Zi opened the red envelope, the Liu Suer family was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>The envelope contained exactly 10,000 yuan; she had thought it would just be a light paper bag.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't ask Min Shengjun how much money was in the envelope. But even without eating pork, one can see a fat pig walk by, so he could roughly estimate. No wonder Min Shengjun was carrying such a large backpack.</p><p>Finally, they arrived at Li Daicui's house. As before, Min Shengjun tossed the red envelope onto the bed, but after taking only a few steps, Li Daicui chased after them.</p><p>"Doctor Zhu, no matter what, I cannot accept this money!"</p><p>"Elder sister Daimei, this money is my heartfelt sentiment. Please keep it!"</p><p>Min Shengjun smiled sincerely.</p>

						<p>"I, Zhu Tianlei, absolutely do not lie."</p><p>Li Yong was so surprised that he could hardly believe it. Yes, he had seen Zhu Tianlei's medical skills with his own eyes, and if Zhu Tianlei said everything was fine, then there must be no problem.</p><p>Watching Li Yong bend over busily, a flicker of dimness quickly passed through Zhu Tianlei's eyes.</p><p>The illnesses of these three people were similar to Qiao Jiang's, but they were not the same. Although Qiao Jiang's condition was perilous, his spiritual energy could penetrate it. However, these three people seemed indifferent to his spiritual energy; the spiritual energy sank like a stone into the sea when he tried to input it.</p><p>He could only use acupuncture, and fortunately, silver needles still had some effect on the three of them. As evening approached, one of them finally opened their eyes.</p><p>"Hello, I am Zhu Tianlei."</p><p>Looking at the middle-aged woman who opened her eyes with a dazed expression, Zhu Tianlei spoke softly, his voice betraying a hint of fatigue.</p><p>"Where am I... in a hospital?"</p><p>"Yes, in the emergency center of Yunhai City People's Hospital."</p><p>"How did I end up here?"</p><p>The woman tried to get up but was immediately pressed back down by Zhu Tianlei. Due to her extremely weak condition, she fell back onto the bed before he could even use force.</p><p>"Sister, I would like to ask you, in the one or two days leading up to your arrival at the hospital, did you feel anything unusual about your body?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei needed more information. If it was indeed an infectious disease, relying solely on silver needles would not be enough.</p><p>"I just returned from abroad. Previously, I felt very tired all over and had a slight fever. Oh right, my eyes were itchy..."</p><p>The woman also felt that her body lacked any strength at all, and the young man in front of her made her feel very close, so she had a good attitude.</p><p>"Abroad?"</p><p>"Yes, I was on a business trip abroad. The moment I got off the plane, I felt completely drained of energy. Before I could react, I passed out."</p><p>At that moment, another patient woke up.</p><p>"Brother, I'm Dr. Zhu Tianlei from the hospital. I would like to ask you, before you fainted, were there any parts of your body that felt uncomfortable?"</p><p>The man was around fifty years old and looked scholarly.</p><p>"I had a fever, no energy in my entire body, my eyes hurt, and I also felt some pain in my chest...."</p><p>Dr. Zhu Tianlei and Li Yong exchanged glances; the two patients' statements confirmed that they were indeed infected with the same virus.</p><p>"Before Brother was brought to the hospital, did he go anywhere?"</p><p>"I was driving when I suddenly felt pain in my chest and couldn't breathe. I feared it might be an acute myocardial infarction, so I rushed to the hospital myself by car. I didn't expect to pass out before reaching the hospital gate.... Young man, what illness do I have?"</p><p>The man was very calm, asking a question that went straight to the point.</p><p>"Brother, you haven't answered my question yet. Before falling ill, did you go anywhere?"</p><p>"I just returned from abroad......"</p><p>As soon as the middle-aged man finished speaking, everyone on the nearby beds turned their heads.</p><p>"You were also abroad? Where did you go?"</p><p>"Kernal."</p><p>"I went to Kernal too."</p><p>There was shock in both of their voices.</p><p>"Hey kid, do we have a contagious disease?"</p><p>The middle-aged man asked calmly, with not even a hint of panic in his voice, which left Zhu Tianlei quite impressed.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei replied truthfully. He always believed that hiding the condition from patients was not wise; they had the right to know, and besides, only by being truthful could patients have a clear understanding of their condition, which would help them better cooperate with treatment.</p><p>"It seems my guess was correct. Kid, are you a doctor at the city hospital?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>This answer came from Li Yong. Zhu Tianlei glanced at Li Yong but remained silent. He knew what Li Yong was thinking, and whether it was true or not did not matter to him.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was stunned. Who was this person? After learning they might have a contagious disease, not only did they remain calm but also showed great experience in preventing contagious diseases.</p><p>"Back then during that nns incident, if we had taken it seriously from the start, the condition wouldn't have spread so quickly and caused so many deaths."</p><p>A trace of pain flashed across the middle-aged man's face.</p><p>Li Yong took over again, hiding Wei Baoguo's decision from Zhu Tianlei and even not telling him about it. He didn't want Zhu Tianlei to feel burdened.</p><p>"Hmm, good job! You're doing a great job!"</p><p>Li Yong's words relieved the man, who looked approvingly at him.</p><p>At that moment, hurried footsteps could be heard outside the emergency room, followed by the door being pushed open forcefully. Several teenage boys rushed in from outside.</p><p>"Where's my dad?"</p><p>The leader of a group, a thin-looking teenager with a thick dialect from Jilin, asked.</p><p>"How did you get in here?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face darkened. Hadn't he already arranged for the emergency room to be isolated and set up special protective barriers outside? How had these children managed to sneak in?</p><p>"We walked in. Where's my dad? Is my dad here... Dad! Dad!"</p><p>Suddenly, the teenager's gaze fell on the middle-aged man lying on the farthest bed and shouted loudly, rushing into the ward.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face remained stern.</p><p>He couldn't endanger these children; before confirming the source and mode of transmission, they could still be infected even without physical contact.</p><p>So he casually grabbed a few cotton swabs from the medicine cabinet and threw them at the teenager. The teenager was running forward when suddenly felt a pain in his ankle. He looked down to see only a cotton swab lying on the ground.</p><p>"Get out of here quickly, or I won't say it again."</p><p>The teenager lifted his head, looking at Zhu Tianlei with hatred on his face.</p><p>"What did you do to my dad? Did you kill him?"</p><p>The middle-aged man had an oxygen mask on and was breathing heavily. If not for the numbers constantly flashing on the machine, no one would have known he was alive.</p><p>"Your dad is sick and needs treatment. Get out now, or I won't say it again!"</p><p>They were still just children who couldn't understand the severity of the situation. He couldn't tell them the truth; otherwise, if the news spread, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p>"No way, we're not leaving!"</p><p>"Yes, we are not going!"</p><p>Several slightly younger boys echoed in agreement.</p><p>"You have no choice!"</p><p>After saying that, Zhu Tianlei grabbed all the cotton swabs from the medicine cabinet and casually threw them. The cotton swabs flew like arrows, heading straight for the boys.</p><p>The boys watched the cotton swabs flying towards them but didn't seem to mind until the swabs hit their bodies, causing them sharp pain and screams of agony. Only then did they realize they needed to dodge.</p>

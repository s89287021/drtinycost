						<p>Oh my God!</p><p>There was actually a lump between the two tubers.</p><p>"This is called 'Yin Zhu,' and only Morinda officinalis that has grown for over twenty years in a damp environment will have it."</p><p>Yue Xiume's face turned ugly again.</p><p>"I'm not gambling anymore, give me back the item!"</p><p>Yue Xiume finally understood that this cucumber egg and Old Man Ran were clearly working together to deceive her of the Morinda officinalis. Dream on!</p><p>"Do you want to avoid gambling?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's face darkened abruptly, his gaze fierce, scaring Yue Xiume into a shiver.</p><p>"You... you... what do you want to do? The item is mine, I said no gambling, so we're not doing it, okay?"</p><p>Yue Xiume calmed herself and said dryly.</p><p>"In the casino, when you gamble with money, put your money on the table; if you gamble with your life, hang your head in your belt. Since ancient times, gambling is all about risk, only forward, no retreat..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's voice was not loud, but to Yue Xiume it sounded like a death knell, making goosebumps rise on her back.</p><p>"Do you want to gamble or not?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei repeated the four words again. This time, not only Yue Xiume, even Feng Qi, who was used to fighting and killing, felt chills in his heart.</p><p>Who is this young man? Why does he have such an imposing presence at such a young age?</p><p>"I... I don't want to gamble..."</p><p>"Clang!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei gently tapped the aluminum door frame beside him. It was just a light tap, but in an instant, the aluminum door frame was snapped and fell to the ground.</p><p>"I-I-I..."</p><p>Yue Xiumei was completely stunned.</p><p>What should she do?</p><p>Her husband had gone out, not returning for ten days or half a month. Now, it was just her alone, wanting to seek help, but looking at the gazes of those around her, there was no way anyone would come to her aid.</p><p>"People do what they do, and heaven watches. The more one harbors malicious intentions, the easier they fall ill. Your spleen and stomach are out of harmony, your endometritis persists despite repeated treatments, two years ago after appendicitis surgery, an infection occurred at the incision site, leading to multiple hospitalizations. Scoliosis, lumbar muscle strain, no amount of physical therapy or acupuncture has managed to root it out..."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei spoke at length. Yue Xiumei looked at Zhu Tianlei as if she had seen a ghost. Who was he? How could he know her condition so well? Could it be that a competitor had sent him to sabotage her?</p><p>Even so, it was impossible for him to know about her repeatedly unresolved endometritis. She hadn't even told her own husband about this matter; every time she went to the hospital, she would go and return in secret.</p><p>Of course, Yue Xiumei wasn't the only one shocked; the onlookers were as well. From Yue Xiumei's ghost-like expression, they all knew that what this young man was saying was correct.</p><p>"You said you collected these rehmannia roots half a month ago, right? Good, I'll let everyone see exactly what your rehmannia roots looked like half a month ago..."</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Zhu Tianlei suddenly picked up the rehmannia root from the ground. With a snap, the sixty-centimeter-long rehmannia was broken in half.</p><p>The juice inside sprayed onto the faces and bodies of the crowd like spring rain, a faint aroma of fresh herbs spreading out.</p><p>"This rehmannia has clear patterns running through it, crisscrossing in various directions, proving that it was picked at least a week ago. The medicinal liquid has a fragrance that is neither too strong nor too weak, with hints of earthy scents upon closer inspection. All those who understand herbs know that within a week after being exposed to the natural environment, the juice inside the herbs will completely evaporate. Even indoors, after half a month, the juice would have disappeared entirely."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words were clear and distinct.</p><p>Such knowledge was something even experts in the herb trade, having done business for over twenty years, might not possess with such detail and comprehensiveness.</p><p>But, no one denies that what Zhu Tianlei said was right.</p><p>"This Polygonatum, whose is it? Does Boss Yue need me to say it?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei shouted at Boss Yue, causing Ye Xiuimei to shudder once again.</p><p>Now, her mind was in a complete mess, and she had no idea how to respond; the other party was simply too formidable.</p><p>"Humph, take this thing away. It's really unlucky. Go, go, go! I'm closing up!"</p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiuimei naturally wouldn't face Zhu Tianlei head-on again. Moreover, the Polygonatum had already been broken and couldn't be sold for a good price, so it was better to just push it out.</p><p>"Money?"</p><p>"Money? What money?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei didn't leave; he simply looked at Ye Xiuimei indifferently.</p><p>"Boss Yue really has a poor memory. Before we started the bet, we agreed that if Boss Yue won, I would pay 80,000 yuan to buy the Polygonatum and another 20,000 yuan as a bonus. If Your Majesty won, Boss Yue would return the Polygonatum to Your Majesty and also compensate Your Majesty with 20,000 yuan. Forgotten?"</p><p>Ye Xiuimei almost choked from anger.</p><p>Wanting her to pay? She dreamed on!</p><p>No way!</p><p>"You're extorting me! Do you have any evidence that I said this? Huh? Go, go, go! Get out of here or I'll call the police!"</p><p>Ye Xiuimei's reputation for throwing a tantrum was well-known throughout the ginseng and bird's nest market.</p><p>She didn't believe that Zhu Tianlei could do anything to her, a woman.</p><p>"I have no evidence, and I don't need any. I only give you one chance. Will you take the money or not?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's words showed no anger, yet they made the onlookers dare not speak loudly anymore and even their eyes became cautious.</p><p>If Zhu Tianlei knew that nearly half of the people in the six regions of the Ginseng and Medicinal Herbs Market were now running over to watch the commotion, he would probably be very surprised!</p><p>In the WeChat group of the Ginseng and Medicinal Herbs Market, messages about the gambling incident at Dafaherbal Medicine Shop flooded the screen.</p><p>At this moment, Yue Xiumei glared at Zhu Tianlei, holding her ground.</p><p>"No."</p><p>Yue Xiumei gritted her teeth. Her monthly profit was not even 20,000 yuan. What right did she have?</p><p>"Very well!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei showed no anger whatsoever. Instead, he curled the corner of his mouth upward and raised his handsome eyebrow, instantly catching the hearts of several young girls in the crowd, whose hearts raced and feelings stirred.</p><p>"Aren't you all recording short videos and posting them on your Moments? Now I'll give you a chance to ensure that your posts get a skyrocketing number of clicks."</p><p>After saying this, Zhu Tianlei walked straight to the medicinal herbs cabinet and picked up a handful of herbs.</p><p>"This is Euonymus alatus bark, which everyone should be familiar with. However, the Euonymus alatus bark from Dafaherbal Medicine Shop might be unknown to you. It has been fumigated with sulfur, substituting inferior products for better ones, old products for new ones......"</p><p>"This is Bupleurum scorzonerifolium, also known as Pearl Plate. Originally, it's the root of Bupleurum scorzonerifolium, dried after removing stems, leaves, and hairs. However, the Bupleurum scorzonerifolium in my hand is actually wild radish that has been dried and marinated with Bupleurum scorzonerifolium powder......"</p><p>"This is sandalwood, of course, different from the sandalwood we usually know. This fake sandalwood is made by soaking cypress wood together with water that has soaked real sandalwood....... "</p><p>...</p><p>Zhu Tianlei strolled through the market like a flower admirer in a garden, carefully examining each unique herb and plant, his posture graceful and his demeanor elegant.</p><p>Yue Xiumei leaned against the counter with a pale complexion.</p>

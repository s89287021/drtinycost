						<p>The Second Conference Hall was spacious, featuring a massive conference table that could seat at least fifty people. In the center of the table, there was an indentation where silk flowers in various colors, vivid and vibrant, were placed.</p><p>In front of the conference table stood a lectern with a microphone and wireless headphones on it.</p><p>A large projection screen was hung on the wall.</p><p>After Zhu Tianlei entered, he directly sat down in a chair beside the projection screen.</p><p>"Director Zhang, come sit, no need for formalities!"</p><p>Zhang Gu's expression changed. This Zhu Tianlei treated the police station as if it were his home.</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>However, regardless of what he thought inside, Zhang Gu's current principle was to avoid provoking Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, the conference room door was pushed open again, and a man with a stern expression walked in.</p><p>This person exuded a sense of integrity and impartiality from just one glance.</p><p>"Director."</p><p>Zhang Gu stood up, his attitude respectful.</p><p>"Are you Director Guan?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei also stood up.</p><p>He always treated people he respected with utmost reverence, regardless of their status; conversely, for those not worthy of respect, even if they were as revered as a deity, Zhu Tianlei would not bend over.</p><p>Guan Yunli was forty-seven years old and had graduated from the Yunhai City Public Security Academy. He was originally a university professor but later, for some reason, left academia to join the military police, starting from the grassroots level and gradually rising to become the Chief of Police in Yunhai City. He had achieved this position through solid work and accumulating combat achievements.</p><p>"You are Zhu Tianlei, right?"</p><p>"Yes, Director Guan."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei smiled faintly with a very humble attitude, looking like a first-year student meeting his teacher for the first time, which made Zhang Gu feel a bit annoyed.</p><p>"Alright then, little Zhu. I've heard about the incident. It's my fault as Police Chief for not being strict enough; I'm truly ashamed!"</p><p>Guan Yunli's attitude was sincere, definitely not putting on an act for others to see.</p><p>"Director Guan, you are exaggerating. The security of Yunhai City has always been top-ranked nationwide, and your contributions have been the greatest. Such a minor matter shouldn't bother Director Guan."</p><p>"Haha, little Zhu is so young but has such a broad-minded heart; that's quite remarkable!"</p><p>Guan Yunli had a very good first impression of Zhu Tianlei. He liked this kind-hearted and responsible young man.</p><p>"You are truly remarkable, Director Guan. It's said that back then you pursued three hundred miles alone with the drug enforcement team, got shot twice, yet managed to capture the kingpin. I get excited just hearing your heroic deeds dozens of times."</p><p>"That was all in my younger days. Now, I'm old and can't do much on this job for long; it will be your young people's world in the future."</p><p>Lian Po is old but can he still eat? This is a feeling that every hero faces in their later years.</p><p>Zhang Gu watched as the two men talked enthusiastically, feeling awkward since he was left out. Fortunately, his discomfort didn't last long.</p><p>"Director Mao, you're here!"</p><p>The one who came in wasn't anyone else; it was Mao Fang.</p><p>Behind her were two young men in black suits, standing tall and looking straight ahead, clearly military veterans.</p><p>Seeing Guan Yunli stand up, they greeted the woman with great respect, and Zhang Gu followed suit.</p><p>He had no idea about Mao Fang's identity; all he knew was that Qiu Ran had provoked the wrong person, and the other party intended to deal with him.</p><p>"Xiao Guan, you don't need to be formal with me. Sit down quickly!"</p><p>Zhang Gu was slightly surprised by this woman's title for Gu Yunli as 'Xiao Guan,' considering their similar ages, and she even seemed a bit younger.</p><p>"Tianlei, have you been here for a long time?"</p><p>"No, I just arrived not too long ago."</p><p>In such a situation, Zhu Tianlei deliberately kept some distance from Mao Fang. Mao Fang highly appreciated Zhu Tianlei's ability to understand when to advance or retreat.</p><p>"Director Gu, since everyone is here, let's get started."</p><p>"Yes, I will go call the people in."</p><p>Zhang Gu quickly stood up; after all, how could he lack such self-awareness?</p><p>"Director Gu, I'll go!"</p><p>Watching Zhang Gu leave, Zhu Tianlei secretly thought that if he hadn't interrupted those two earlier, being trapped in the room with Zhang Gu would have been quite entertaining.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Qiu Ran entered following Zhang Gu. To his surprise, Zheng Chuzhang, who had been intimate with Qiu Ran, also came along.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but feel sympathetic towards Zhang Gu; he really was wearing a green hat.</p><p>"Qiu Ran, do you know why I brought you here today?"</p><p>Director Gu repressed his smile and became serious again.</p><p>"Director Gu, to be honest, I really don't know."</p><p>Chiu Ran said while not forgetting to give Zhu Tianlei a fierce glare. However, Zhu Tianlei did not seem the least bit uncomfortable; instead, he even raised his legs.</p><p>"Didn't know?"</p><p>"Yes. Ever since I was brought to the city bureau, I have been thinking about the reason, but until now, I still haven't figured it out. Please, Director Guan, inform me."</p><p>"Really? Well then, let me ask you this: Who privately transferred Zhu Tianlei from the city bureau to the detention center for interrogation? And not only that, but they even arranged for him to be placed in a cell with hardened criminals?"</p><p>"Director Guan's implication is that I did this?"</p><p>Upon hearing Guan Yunli's words, Chiu Ran did not show any signs of being caught off guard. Instead, she directly shot back at him. This move surprised Zhu Tianlei, who thoughtfully glanced at the woman standing behind Zhang Gu.</p><p>Zhang Chu? What kind of official is she?</p><p>"Chiu Ran, this is the city bureau. We are currently conducting an investigation into your corruption and abuse of power. Please be serious!"</p><p>Guan Yunli's voice deepened. It had to be said that those who had participated in anti-drug operations were different; when his voice rose, it felt as though the temperature in the entire conference room dropped significantly.</p><p>"Director Guan, do I not have the right to defend myself? Just because this is not my responsibility, does it mean I should take the blame?"</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Guan Yunli felt his head spin.</p><p>This Chiu Ran seemed different from a few days ago. Now, sitting before him was the lover of the provincial secretary, and Chiu Ran's attitude clearly aimed to embarrass Guan Yunli.</p><p>"Director Guan, you are also an experienced leader who has risen through the ranks from grassroots positions. I respect you, but that does not mean I will let you smear me with false accusations."</p><p>"Chiu Ran, what kind of attitude is this?"</p><p>Zhang Gu originally did not want to speak up, after all, Qiu Ran was Sun Jianguo's son-in-law. Although he had no significant status in the Sun family, he was still considered part of the family. However, at this moment, as the deputy bureau chief of the city bureau, watching Qiu Ran being disrespectful to Guan Yunli, if he did nothing, he would inevitably be criticized.</p><p>Sun Jianguo was already a thing of the past; Zhang Gu still had to consider his career path.</p><p>"Bureau Chief Zhang, didn't you see my attitude? I was only defending myself and did not want to be slandered or falsely accused."</p>

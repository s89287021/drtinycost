						<p>Although the security guard did not explicitly state it, the disdain in his eyes spoke volumes. Zhu Tianlei had always felt a bit inferior in front of Hao Xinmei, and now this sense of inadequacy was inexplicably exposed by the security guard at the entrance to Hao Xinmei's company, amplifying his humiliation several times over.</p><p>"I am indeed a friend of Chairman Hao. If you don't believe me, you can call him."</p><p>"Call? Do you think Chairman Hao's phone is something anyone can use at will? Forget about someone like you or me; even those famous playboys in Yunhai City, Chairman Hao doesn't give them the time of day. Brother, hurry up and leave before you end up humiliating yourself."</p><p>The security guard's words seemed to be for Zhu Tianlei's own good, but each word trampled on Zhu Tianlei's dignity.</p><p>"I'll say it one last time: I want to see Hao Xinmei."</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's anger had been ignited, but since the guard was from Hao Xinmei's company, he did not want to start a conflict unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>"Why are you so stubborn? I've spoken to you politely for so long, yet you won't listen. Hurry up and leave! Soon, important clients will be visiting the company, and you don't want to get in their way. Leave now!"</p><p>The guard grew angry and pushed Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>At that moment, Hua Rong, who had been sleeping in the handbag, suddenly leaped out and bit the guard's hand. In pain, the guard flung Hua Rong away.</p><p>"Hua Rong!"</p><p>Seeing the guard about to kick Hua Rong, Zhu Tianlei could no longer contain his anger and kicked the guard away.</p><p>"Fine, you wait! I'll get you back for this!"</p><p>The guard's hand, which had been bitten by the dog, was bleeding. After being kicked by Zhu Tianlei, he couldn't suppress his fury and made a threatening statement before shouting into his walkie-talkie. Soon, seven or eight burly security guards burst out of the building.</p><p>The group of guards quickly surrounded Zhu Tianlei. Holding Hua Rong, Zhu Tianlei's anger faded away, and he gave a faint smile as he looked at the guards surrounding him.</p><p>"I'll say it one last time: I am Chairman Hao's friend. Before you act, think carefully; otherwise, you might regret it."</p><p>"Shut up! Attack!"</p><p>A group of security guards pounced on Zhu Tianlei without any hesitation. Zhu Tianlei remained calm, slowly retreating to a stone pillar at the entrance of the building, hugging Hua Rong, with one foot placed on the pillar and a sinister smile on his face.</p><p>"Let's do it then!"</p><p>The security guards were thoroughly enraged. Leading them was a small, chubby man whose fleshy fists, resembling hammers, landed on Zhu Tianlei's shoulder with a thud.</p><p>At that moment......</p><p>"Hold it! Everyone, stop it!"</p><p>Hao Xinhui, wearing a light purple dress, walked out of the building and saw Zhu Tianlei being attacked. Concerned, she shouted loudly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei grinned widely, sitting down beneath the stone pillar. Hua Rong, in his arms, let out wailing cries.</p><p>"Madam Hao, this kid is causing trouble at the entrance and brought a small animal along. My hand got bitten by that little beast!"</p><p>Seeing Hao Xinhui appear, the first security guard immediately approached, showing off his injured hand to her.</p><p>Noticing Hao Xinhui's extremely ugly expression, the security guard continued aggressively.</p><p>"Madam Hao, this brat claims to be your friend, but he has no idea who he is dealing with. He should look in a mirror; how could Madam Hao have such a friend? It's an insult to you, Madam Hao. And that little beast looks like a stray puppy. Please go about your business, I won't trouble you with this small matter. I guarantee to make sure both this brat and the little beast disappear from our building right away."</p><p>The security guard spoke with utmost conviction and loyalty, but he completely failed to notice the coldness in Hao Xinhui's eyes.</p><p>"He is my friend, and that dog is my pet!"</p><p>Hao Xinhui said softly.</p><p>The security guard felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over him. In the heat of August, it felt like winter.</p><p>He just said Madam Hao could have such a friend, insulting her; he also called that dog a stray puppy......</p><p>Well, well! The guard's legs went limp, and the other guards stared blankly. Their jobs were probably in jeopardy.</p><p>"Mr. Hao, your hospitality is rather lacking, oh my..." Zhu Tianlei looked at Hao Xinmei's ice-cold beautiful face with a slight thrill inside, cracking a smile to play up his suffering act for Hao Xinmei.</p><p>"Hua Rong!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei glanced at Zhu Tianlei without speaking, instead calling out Hua Rong adoringly. The little dog instantly jumped out of Zhu Tianlei's arms and happily ran into Hao Xinmei's embrace.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei could not help but roll his eyes; this woman still favored her dog over him, despite the effort he made to specially send her there by bus. Hmph, kindness goes unrewarded!</p><p>"Come on, let me take you back to the company!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei kissed Hua Rong a few times before turning to Zhu Tianlei and speaking coolly.</p><p>"Hua Rong has been delivered, so I won't intrude further, lest I offend Mr. Hao!"</p><p>Hao Xinmei gave Zhu Tianlei, who was acting like a spoiled child, an unkind look, her beautiful eyes twinkling, lips slightly curved upward.</p><p>"Since that's the case, then we'll see each other another day!"</p><p>Upon hearing Hao Xinmei's words, Zhu Tianlei almost fainted from anger. It truly said that the sting of a wasp is nothing compared to the venom in a woman's heart!</p><p>"Hmph, I came all this way and won't get a drink before leaving; that would be too much. I'll just go up for a glass of water, that's all!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was angry but could not afford to miss the chance to get close to the beauty. After all, it was normal for a man to have some thick skin in front of his beloved woman, thicker skin means more food!</p><p>Hao Xinmei smiled at Zhu Tianlei, who was walking towards the building with puffed-up cheeks, and then glanced at the guards, her expression quite sour.</p><p>"You all go to the human resources department to handle your resignation procedures. I will ask them to pay you an additional three months of salary."</p><p>After saying that, he held Hua Rong and entered the building, his high heels making a soft clinking sound on the smooth marble floor.</p><p>Several security guards breathed a sigh of relief simultaneously; this outcome was far better than they had expected.</p><p>"You're really heartless. My employee beat me up, and General Hao didn't even say a word to comfort me!"</p><p>In the elevator, Zhu Tianlei continued his act of self-harm, but to his surprise, Hao Xinmei did not give him a second glance, merely bending down to play with Hua Rong in her arms.</p><p>Thinking that he was considered less than a dog in the other person's heart, Zhu Tianlei did momentarily regret following them so tenaciously.</p><p>"You were acting on purpose just now."</p><p>As they were about to exit the elevator, Hao Xinmei suddenly spoke up.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was taken aback but refused to admit it on his face.</p><p>"What are you talking about? On purpose?"</p><p>"That security guard wasn't even a match for you. If you wanted to hide, those security guards together wouldn't have been either."</p><p>Hao Xinmei said this and then got out of the elevator.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei rolled his eyes; couldn't she just pretend not to know?</p><p>"I say, General Hao, using such a large office all by yourself, don't you feel lonely and isolated?"</p>

						<p>Yang Zhongmin said, his jowls trembling as he spoke, truly 'expressive with both voice and emotion, words sincere.'</p><p>"I have met President Song; he is a very professional and meticulous old doctor. I believe in his medical skills and management abilities. Isn't County Mayor Yang perhaps being misled by someone?"</p><p>John was indeed the ruler of Europe's pharmaceutical industry. In front of Yang Zhongmin, he showed no courtesy whatsoever.</p><p>Yang Zhongmin turned pale at John's words but cursed inwardly.</p><p>"Of course not. I have already had people investigate it. The unlicensed physician is currently in the county hospital. If Mr. John is interested, I can arrange for someone to bring him over for you."</p><p>John blinked his eyes. He did not interact much with Yang Zhongmin and only knew that this county mayor was a seasoned politician who could handle matters efficiently and meticulously. However, he clearly sensed that today's Yang Zhongmin was not simply there to visit the patient but seemed to have other intentions.</p><p>"Since County Mayor Yang says so, I shall humbly comply!"</p><p>Yang Zhongmin's eyes quickly flashed with a hint of satisfaction.</p><p>"Xiao Yu, go and ask Dr. Song Binyan to bring the visiting expert clinic doctor here. Tell them that Yang Zhongmin wants to see him."</p><p>Xiao Yu was Yang Zhongmin's secretary, having graduated from university just two years ago, still green as a cucumber. He followed Yang Zhongmin's instructions obediently. As soon as Yang Zhongmin finished speaking, he turned and prepared to leave.</p><p>At this moment, the door of the ward was suddenly pushed open from the outside, and Zhu Tianlei walked in with a smile on his face.</p><p>"County Mayor Yang need not trouble himself; I am the doctor from the visiting expert clinic, Zhu Tianlei."</p><p>Yang Zhongmin's puffy face sank sharply when he heard Zhu Tianlei's words.</p><p>This was the first time he had met Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>It was this inexperienced brat who had made his nephew impotent and dashed his hopes of continuing the Yang family lineage. He also caused him to stumble more than once in his political career.</p><p>In recent days, he had been pulling strings to get his high school classmate Mu Kun released from custody, but the results were shocking. Those people whom he thought were close friends and could be swayed with just a phone call suddenly fell silent upon hearing Mu Kun's name, hanging up after brief conversations, and refused to answer further calls.</p><p>He went to visit but was turned away for various reasons. Mu Kun's wife frequently came to cause trouble, threatening Yang Zhongmin that she would report him if he did not get Mu Kun out of prison. All this left Yang Zhongmin exhausted and miserable. Of course, after much thought, he blamed everything on Zhu Tianlei and thus resolved to revenge Zhu Tianlei by any means necessary. Therefore, when he learned that John, who was scheduled for an inspection in Dahexian County, had been involved in an incident and was receiving treatment at the county hospital, he immediately came up with a plan. John's status would be highly regarded not just in Yunhai City but even by higher-ranking officials. Hence, if John spoke out, Zhu Tianlei would inevitably fall from grace. At that time, Yang Zhongmin could eliminate Zhu Tianlei secretly and unnoticed. However, now Zhu Tianlei was right before him, and for a moment, Yang Zhongmin did not know what to say. "Is County Secretary Yang here for treatment of infertility?" "You..." Yang Zhongmin did not expect Zhu Tianlei to ask such a question and immediately trembled with anger. This matter was like a thorn in his heart, something no one could bring up. "Did I guess wrong? Sorry, County Secretary Yang! It's my bad!" Zhu Tianlei laughed harmlessly, carrying a hint of youthful naivety and softness. "Zhu Tianlei, you have really guts to sneak into the county hospital! Do you think your job offer from Song Boyan will let you get away with it? Ha! In your dreams!" Yang Zhongmin originally intended to expose Zhu Tianlei's 'true face' in front of John but did not expect Zhu Tianlei to immediately reveal his own scars, causing him to lose control and erupt. "I don't quite understand what County Secretary Yang means by 'getting away with it.' Did I kill someone or make someone barren? Could County Secretary Yang please enlighten me!"</p><p>Pah!</p><p>John beside him remained silent but seemed to understand that Mayor Yang's true target must be Zhu Tianlei.</p><p>"Zhu Tianlei, you really are quite the silver-tongued devil, a master of sophistry! Whether or not you killed someone, as a rural thug without medical qualifications practicing in the county hospital, this is illegal. My Dahe County's healthcare system absolutely cannot tolerate people like you."</p><p>Yang Zhongmin stood up, his right hand raised with his chubby and sturdy fingers pointing at Zhu Tianlei, shouting angrily.</p><p>Secretary Xiao Yu looked at his leader in surprise; he had followed Yang Zhongmin for two years, and the latter could be described as a smiling tiger who faced everything with a smile. This was the first time Xiao Yu had seen him lose his temper like this.</p><p>"What does Mayor Yang plan to do then?"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei glanced playfully at John on the hospital bed, a smile playing on his lips.</p><p>"Hmph, I will have Song Bainen expel you and add you to Yinhai City's healthcare blacklist, ensuring you can never illegally practice medicine or harm patients again. I also intend to hold Song Bainen accountable to clean up the county hospital's atmosphere."</p><p>"Well then, since Mayor Yang has spoken, I have no grounds for rebuttal. However, before I leave my post, I need to brief the patient briefly. Could Mayor Yang please wait a moment?"</p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p>Yang Zhongmin snorted.</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei not resist but calmly accept his arrangement, he finally felt somewhat better in his heart.</p><p>He also secretly speculated that this Zhu Tianlei did not seem as troublesome as rumored. Had his wife and Zhang Quan exaggerated?</p><p>Was Mu Kun's case just a coincidence?</p><p>"John, I'm very sorry, but you will likely need a new doctor. I have no medical qualifications and am not formally trained in medicine; before practicing, I was just a small hooligan in the village. As a VIP guest of Yinhai City, I cannot delay your recovery. I'm truly sorry!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei looked at John and said in a solemn voice, his tone filled with deep sorrow.</p><p>Yang Zhongmin was struck dumb by lightning.</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>Was Zhu Tianlei John's attending physician?</p><p>Wasn't it Song Bainen who was supposed to be the miracle worker who pulled John back from the brink of death, but rather this Zhu Tianlei?</p><p>"No, Dr. Zhu, I only accept you as my personal attending physician, and I have already discussed this with President Song; in the future, every time I come to Yuhai, you will be my private physician."</p><p>John spoke with conviction.</p><p>Yang Zhongmin's face turned pale instantly.</p>

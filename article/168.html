						<p>"Don't say any more, in any case, I disagree with this. Before the illness is fully understood, I cannot issue such a notification."</p><p>Wei Baoguo glanced at Li Yong and said sternly.</p><p>He was able to become the president of this hospital largely because of that nns incident. As a main force of the hospital, he led a medical team into the quarantine zone when the virus was still unclear, starting from discovering infected cases until the end, he treated a total of 3,726 patients and stayed in the quarantine zone for seventy-nine day and night.</p><p>It was in that year that he became the president of this top-tier hospital with more than five-sixths of the total votes in the election for the president of the hospital. In an instant, it had been nearly twenty years.</p><p>He did not want to take such a risk, and he also did not believe that Secretary Qiao was not already cured?</p><p>If it were an infectious disease, how could it be cured so quickly? Besides, would Secretary Qiao and Director Mao also have to be isolated?</p><p>"President..."</p><p>"You go out. I will call Li Ping later. This matter ends here!"</p><p>Li Yong tried to say more, but Wei Baoguo had already lowered his head and started reading the documents on the desk. Li Yong's lips moved a few times, then he clenched his fists and turned to leave the president's office.</p><p>After Li Yong's figure disappeared, Wei Baoguo raised his head.</p><p>He seemed lost in thought.</p><p>Li Yong, who came out of the president's office, looked rather unhappy.</p><p>He believed Zhu Tianlei and also trusted his instincts. He did not believe that President Wei would really be indifferent to this matter either, but having been in the position of president for so long, he was overly attached to power, doing things cautiously and even forgetting his responsibility as a doctor to save lives and heal injuries.</p><p>No, even if President Wei disagreed, he had to stand by Zhu Tianlei's side. Otherwise, he would not be able to live up to his ex-girlfriend or the promise he made at her coffin that he would become a qualified doctor, fulfill the promises they made together in university, making this world free from diseases, deaths, and separations...</p><p>That promise, which seemed so naive even then and still does now, was something Li Yong never forgot.</p><p>Thinking of this, Li Yong quickly walked down the stairs and rushed to the emergency room. </p><p>At the same time, Li Ping received a call from Wei Baoguo.</p><p>"What's wrong, Director Li?"</p><p>Seeing Li Ping's slightly pale face after putting down the phone, Zhao Xin asked with concern.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Zhao Xin also turned pale.</p><p>Although the hospital was public, Wei Baoguo was like a god in this public hospital. No one could oppose or change his decisions.</p><p>"Director Li......"</p><p>"Nurse Manager Zhao, we've been colleagues for many years and are good friends off the clock. What do you think about this? I want to hear your true thoughts."</p><p>Li Ping's face was very solemn.</p><p>Zhao Xin fell silent for a moment, recalling the scene of their first meeting. Back then, they were both young, full of youthful ideals and vigor. They had worked in the same department for twenty years, one becoming the department director from an intern doctor, the other becoming the nurse manager from a helper nurse sent from nursing school. The journey seemed long yet short.</p><p>"Director Li, your decision is mine. Speak up!"</p><p>Li Ping suddenly raised his head, as if he saw that young girl with two braids smiling brightly in the sun, saying 'Just arrived, please take care of me' as a student from nursing school.</p><p>"Alright, then let's do it together. Damn it all, I've been suppressed for my whole life! Screw them!"</p><p>The usually gentle Li Ping suddenly cursed, making Zhao Xin stare in surprise, but he soon burst into laughter. Yes, they had been too cautious for too long!</p><p>By the time Wei Baoguo found out about all this, it was already late in the afternoon with the sunset casting a beautiful glow across the sky.</p><p>"Li Ping, get to my office now!"</p><p>Wei Baoguo was furious. Li Ping usually seemed obedient, but he never expected him to do such things.</p><p>"President Wei, Director Li is organizing training for the emergency room staff!"</p><p>"Pah! Training be damned!"</p><p>The young nurse shuddered in fear; President Wei had actually sworn at someone.</p><p>With a snap of his finger, Wei Baoguo hung up the phone, his chest heaving violently.</p><p>"Li Ping, immediately disband your personnel. I’ll overlook this incident if you do, otherwise, forget about being the emergency room director!"</p><p>"President Wei, once we have confirmed the diagnosis, I will personally submit my resignation application!"</p><p>Over the phone, Li Ping spoke each word carefully.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Wei Baoguo felt his head spinning and buzzing with confusion.</p><p>"Where are you? Come to my office immediately."</p><p>"President Wei, I am currently in the emergency room. From now on, I will stay here until the patients recover and their conditions are diagnosed!"</p><p>Li Yong's tone was strangely consistent with Li Ping's.</p><p>Wei Baoguo slammed down the phone with a loud thud and fell heavily into the large armchair.</p><p>In the emergency room.</p><p>"Tianlei, his breathing is now very weak. This illness seems to affect the respiratory system; if this continues, he might suffer from respiratory failure!"</p><p>Li Yong stood beside the bed of one of the first male patients, who was in his thirties, and said sternly.</p><p>"Yes, I have noticed that as well. Furthermore, their internal organs are also being affected, with all functions rapidly declining. This means that the virus they are infected with can destroy bodily organs, leading to organ failure throughout the body."</p><p>Sweat was pouring down Tianlei's forehead; in late autumn, he felt like a fire had ignited on his skin.</p><p>Li Yong, however, felt a cold shiver run down his back.</p><p>The nns virus is merely severe acute respiratory syndrome, affecting only the respiratory tract. But this unknown virus can destroy organs throughout the body. As doctors, we understand what that means.</p><p>"Brother Li, put an oxygen mask on him first; I can temporarily ensure that these three patients are not in immediate danger."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>Li Yong asked in shock when he heard Tianlei's words.</p><p>"Where are you? Come to my office immediately."</p><p>"President Wei, I am currently in the emergency room. From now on, I will remain here until the patients recover and their conditions are diagnosed!"</p><p>Li Yong's tone was strangely consistent with Li Ping's.</p><p>Wei Baoguo slammed down the phone with a loud thud and fell heavily into the large armchair.</p><p>In the emergency room.</p><p>"Tianlei, his breathing is now very weak.

This means that the virus they are infected with can destroy bodily organs, leading to organ failure throughout the body."</p><p>Sweat was pouring down Tianlei's forehead; in late autumn, he felt like a fire had ignited on his skin.</p><p>Li Yong, however, felt a cold shiver run down his back.</p><p>The nns virus is merely severe acute respiratory syndrome, affecting only the respiratory tract.

Come to my office at once."</p><p>"President Wei, I am currently in the emergency room and will remain there until the patients recover and their conditions are diagnosed!"</p><p>Li Yong’s tone was oddly similar to Li Ping’s.</p><p>Wei Baoguo slammed down the phone with a loud thud and slumped heavily into the large armchair.</p><p>In the emergency room,</p><p>"Tianlei, his breathing is now extremely weak. This illness appears to target the respiratory system; if this continues, he may suffer from respiratory failure!"</p><p>Li Yong stood beside the bed of one of the first male patients in his thirties and said sternly.</p><p>"Yes, I have noticed that as well.

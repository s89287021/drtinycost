						<p>He couldn't accept it!</p><p>He remembered once when he peeped through the door crack and saw his son and daughter-in-law doing that thing. This little wench's snow-white flesh shimmered, and they made all sorts of noises together. From that moment on, he started having frequent dreams where the person on top of his daughter-in-law was him.</p><p>But just as he was about to achieve his desire, Zhu Tianlei stepped in, not only crippling both his wrists but also rendering him impotent. He hated it!</p><p>Now, seeing this little wench who should have been under him walking through the crowd with a flower-like smile, even more delicate and vibrant than before, Chen Fanglin felt as if countless ants were simultaneously biting at his heart.</p><p>At that moment, his arm was suddenly grabbed by someone. Turning around, he saw an unfamiliar face; the person nodded at him, and inexplicably, Chen Fanglin followed this person out of the crowd.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei sat in a rest room beside the auditorium, cracking sunflower seeds while chatting with Yang Xiaoxue.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue wore a short white down jacket today, with a circle of white rabbit fur around the collar, accentuating her adorable and delicate face. It made people feel itchy to look at her.</p><p>"Tianlei, my dad called me yesterday saying he wants to see you!"</p><p>What?</p><p>The sunflower seeds in Zhu Tianlei's hand fell to the ground with a clatter.</p><p>"You dad... I mean Uncle, haven't we met?"</p><p>After calming himself down, Zhu Tianlei spoke.</p><p>"Are you stupid? Could it be the same person?"</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue's pretty face turned red. Zhu Tianlei usually seemed quite sharp, why did he suddenly become so foolish?</p><p>Zhu Tianlei how could he not understand Yang Xiaoxue's meaning, but he really wasn't mentally prepared for it!</p><p>"In any case, I said it, whether you go or not is your decision!"</p><p>Seeing Zhu Tianlei remain silent for a long time, Yang Xiaoxue pouted.</p><p>"Alright Xiaoxue, I'm just so surprised, how could I possibly not go? Not only will I go, but I'll definitely go boldly."</p><p>Come on, if he, Zhu Tianlei, couldn't even appease his own wife, what was the point of grand ambitions and conquering the world?</p><p>Only then did Yang Xiaoxue burst into tears and laugh.</p><p>"That's better, so let's wait until this busy period is over!"</p><p>Turning around, Yang Xiaoxue became considerate again, her little nose wrinkled cutely. Zhu Tianlei couldn't help but pull her into his arms.</p><p>At this point, apart from their first intimate touch, they hadn't done anything else that was out of the ordinary.</p><p>With the scent of a warm body in his arms, Zhu Tianlei's thoughts began to wander.</p><p>Fortunately, Yang Xiaoxue cooperated this time, allowing Zhu Tianlei to kiss and caress her lips, ears, and neck.</p><p>"Tianlei..... someone might see us......"</p><p>"Don't worry, nobody will come in."</p><p>As he spoke, Zhu Tianlei took off Yang Xiaoxue's down jacket and pushed up her pink undershirt, revealing her black cotton bra covering a pair of rounded mountains. Zhu Tianlei's breathing grew heavy as he lowered his head and buried his face in the mountains.</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue had a faint fragrance on her body, not the smell of shampoo or perfume, but the natural scent of a woman.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei greedily inhaled the fragrance, casually lifting his cotton undershirt to earnestly savor climbing two majestic peaks.</p><p>"Ti......Tianlei......The party is about to start......."</p><p>Yang Xiaoxue felt her body temperature was very high, as if she had a fever, and even her voice sounded not like her own.</p><p>"It doesn't matter, this thing is more important!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei's hand roamed freely over the delicate figure in front of him.</p><p>Just as the two were lost in their passion, the door suddenly opened by someone.</p><p>"Big brother, are you and pretty sister making a baby?"</p><p>Puh!</p><p>Seeing the innocent-looking Little Steel Spring at the door, Zhu Tianlei felt like he was going to spit out an old mouthful of blood.</p><p>"Who taught you these nonsensical things?"</p><p>"My dad told me that men and women touching, kissing, and hugging each other are all for making babies. I was made by him and my mom kissing and hugging!"</p><p>Little Steel Spring obviously did not agree with Zhu Tianlei's definition of 'nonsensical' and protested loudly.</p><p>Zhu Tianlei was simply baffled to an unbelievable extent by this precociously sexual little thing, unable to take it anymore.</p><p>"Nothing more to say, hmm? Brother and sister's baby will still call me Uncle. Uncle Steel Spring, I'll tell him that Uncle Steel Spring watched his parents create him with my own eyes......."</p><p>Xiao Gang Beng saw that Zhu Tianlei didn't speak, his pride grew even more. Pinching his waist, he continued to delve into the topic.</p><p>Is it tolerable? Seeing Yang Xiaoxue had finished tidying up her clothes, Zhu Tianlei rushed forward, grabbed Xiao Gang Beng by the collar, and dragged this little thing out.</p><p>"Big brother, let me go, let me go......"</p><p>Because Zhu Tianlei created opportunities for a new life for those patients in the isolation area, even after their recovery, they didn't sever contact with Zhu Tianlei. This time, hearing that Tianlei Pharmaceutical was having an annual meeting, many people specially came from afar to attend, and Xiao Gang Beng was one of them.</p><p>"Yun Tao, keep an eye on this little thing for me!"</p><p>Zhu Tianlei threw Xiao Gang Beng to Zhang Yun Tao, his tone still not good.</p><p>"Elder brother, what you call is wrathful shame. I will tell Pretty Sister about making babies with you......"</p><p>Xiao Gang Beng was just about to 'threaten' Zhu Tianlei again when he suddenly saw Zhu Tianlei staring at him fiercely and immediately shut up in fear.</p><p>Zhang Yun Tao was utterly confused, but seeing Xiao Gang Beng's cute, round face, she instantly fell in love and didn't ask further questions. She hugged Xiao Gang Beng tightly and kept feeding him candy.</p><p>"Big sister, you are so beautiful, I really like you!"</p><p>Seeing this little thing sniffing around his wife's body, Zhu Tianlei was irritated to see Zhang Yun Tao's chest wet with saliva. His anger rose and fell in his heart.</p><p>Humph, he would definitely firmly reject this brat from coming to make trouble for him in the future.</p><p>Neither Zhang Yun Tao nor Xiao Gang Beng knew about Zhu Tianlei's current mental state. Zhu Tianlei angrily raised his foot and left. The annual meeting was about to start, and he had to take his seat on the podium.</p>
